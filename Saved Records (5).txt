AB Effectively reducing climate change requires marked, global behavior change. However, it is unclear which strategies are most likely to motivate people to change their climate beliefs and behaviors. Here, we tested 11 expert-crowdsourced interventions on four climate mitigation outcomes: beliefs, policy support, information sharing intention, and an effortful tree-planting behavioral task. Across 59,440 participants from 63 countries, the interventions' effectiveness was small, largely limited to nonclimate skeptics, and differed across outcomes: Beliefs were strengthened mostly by decreasing psychological distance (by 2.3%), policy support by writing a letter to a future-generation member (2.6%), information sharing by negative emotion induction (12.1%), and no intervention increased the more effortful behavior-several interventions even reduced tree planting. Last, the effects of each intervention differed depending on people's initial climate beliefs. These findings suggest that the impact of behavioral climate interventions varies across audiences and target behaviors.

ID TRANSITION; EMISSIONS; OPINION; SUPPORT
AB There is continuing debate about which climate-policy instruments are most appropriate to reduce emissions. Undertaking a global survey among scientists who published on climate policy, we provide a systematic overview of (dis)agreements about six main types of policy instruments. The survey includes various fields across the social and natural sciences. The results show that, on average, all instruments are considered important, with direct regulation receiving the highest rating and adoption subsidies and cap-and-trade the lowest. The latter is surprising given the theoretical advantages and real-world success of the EU-ETS. Next, clustering scientific fields based on how important they consider the instruments, we determine five distinct groups, with (a) ecological economists and (b) mathematics/computer science being most dissimilar from other discipline clusters. We explain disagreement through assessing the relative importance assigned to policy criteria effectiveness, efficiency, equity and socio-political feasibility, as well as researchers' attitudes and background. Paying special attention to carbon pricing, motivated by its contested key role, we identify three respondent clusters, namely 'enthusiasts', 'undecided', and 'skeptics'. Examining various policy arguments, we find that agreeing that carbon pricing effectively limits energy/carbon rebound and has potential to be harmonized globally have the strongest association with giving importance to this policy.

   Optimization carbon emission
ID ALGORITHM
AB This study introduces the Worst Moth Disruption Strategy (WMFO) to enhance the Moth Fly Optimization (MFO) algorithm, specifically addressing challenges related to population stagnation and low diversity. The WMFO aims to prevent local trapping of moths, fostering improved global search capabilities. Demonstrating a remarkable efficiency of 66.6 %, WMFO outperforms the MFO on CEC15 benchmark test functions. The Friedman and Wilcoxon tests further confirm WMFO's superiority over state-of-the-art algorithms. Introducing a hybrid model, WMFO-MLP, combining WMFO with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), facilitates effective parameter tuning for carbon emission prediction, achieving an outstanding total accuracy of 97.8 %. Comparative analysis indicates that the MLP-WMFO model surpasses alternative techniques in precision, reliability, and efficiency. Feature importance analysis reveals that variables such as Oil Efficiency and Economic Growth significantly impact MLP-WMFO's predictive power, contributing up to 40 %. Additionally, Gas Efficiency, Renewable Energy, Financial Risk, and Political Risk explain 26.5 %, 13.6 %, 8 %, and 6.5 %, respectively. Finally, WMFO-MLP performance offers advancements in optimization and predictive modeling with practical applications in carbon emission prediction.

AB In the last decade many publications have appeared on degrowth as a strategy to confront environmental and social problems. We undertake a systematic review of their content, data and methods. This involves the use of computational linguistics to identify main topics investigated. Based on a sample of 561 studies we conclude that: (1) content covers 11 main topics; (2) the large majority (almost 90%) of studies are opinions rather than analysis; (3) few studies use quantitative or qualitative data, and even fewer ones use formal modelling; (4) the first and second type tend to include small samples or focus on non-representative cases; (5) most studies offer ad hoc and subjective policy advice, lacking policy evaluation and integration with insights from the literature on environmental/climate policies; (6) of the few studies on public support, a majority concludes that degrowth strategies and policies are socially-politically infeasible; (7) various studies represent a "reverse causality" confusion, i.e. use the term degrowth not for a deliberate strategy but to denote economic decline (in GDP terms) resulting from exogenous factors or public policies; (8) few studies adopt a system-wide perspective - instead most focus on small, local cases without a clear implication for the economy as a whole. We illustrate each of these findings for concrete studies.

AB In this article, we analyze an inverted U-shaped relationship between the type of regime (on the autocracy-democracy scale) and the risks of revolutionary destabilization. Anocracies tend to be more vulnerable to revolutionary destabilization than full autocracies or full (consolidated) democracies. We also point to a strong positive association between the weakening of autocracies and the risks of revolutionary destabilization that exist among full autocracies. In addition, full autocracies moving towards democracy and transitioning to partial autocratic rule are at increased risk of revolutionary destabilization, which explains why the current global spread of democracy is associated with an upswing rather than a downswing in revolutionary activity. Finally, strong forms of revolutionary destabilization are quite possible in cases of deconsolidation of consolidated democracy, which additionally suggests that the era of revolutions will not end in the foreseeable future. Thus, we propose a general theory on the effect of regime type on revolutionary destabilization and address inconsistencies among various studies regarding the impact of the regime on revolutionary instability. The conducted research also allows us to contribute to the answer to the question posed by many researchers of revolutions at the end of the last century - will the era of revolutions end with the global spread of democracy? Our analysis suggests that if this happens someday, it will not be in any foreseeable future.

AB In recent decades, the world has been undergoing extensive digital transformations, often described as the fourth transformative industrial revolution in human history. This revolution, replete with technological innovations and information society platforms, has dramatically altered many aspects of modern life. Governments and public administrations also play a major role in this revolution. They confront the challenges of regulations, various biases and barriers related to digital transformation, interactions with citizens in a highly technological environment, and the changing civic and political culture. This paper seeks to address major missing links in the digital governance puzzle. We suggest conceptual, epistemological, and empirical additions to current literature in this territory highlighting the need to integrate knowledge from various perspectives. Using a threefold interaction framework of human-machine-organization we develop a model to analyze the complex mechanism in which digitization processes in the public sector influence the behavior, performance, and values of public organizations. The model highlights the potential mediating role of perceptions of the Digital Governance Footprint (DGF) and people Mental and Emotional Models (MEMOs). Finally, we explain how multi/mixedmethod analysis can support our model, using process-tracing strategy, comparative case studies, surveys, survey-experiments, and lab experiments.

AB This survey discusses recent developments in the growing literature on the economic history of Russia in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Using novel data and modern empirical methods, this research provides important lessons for development and political economy. We address four strands of this literature. First, we present longterm trends in economic development, illustrating that throughout history, Russia significantly underperformed advanced economies, and quantify the human cost of Joseph Stalin's dictatorship. Second, we discuss studies of imperial Russia focusing on the causes of Russia's relatively low level of economic development and the 1917 revolution. The third strand of the literature focuses on the Soviet period, explaining its slowdown over time and eventual collapse. The fourth strand documents the longterm economic, social, and political consequences of large-scale historical experiments that took place during both the imperial and Soviet periods. We conclude by discussing the lessons from this research and highlighting open questions. (JEL N10, N30, N40, N60, P20, P30,

AB Considering the increased pollution of urban spaces by vandalistic transformations, it is important to take into account the impact they have on observers. The aim of this study is to identify the potential of "soft power" in vandalized texts by determining the characteristics of their perception and memorization, taking into account the theme of the text and the linguistic device used to attract attention. The study utilizes 21 photo images of vandalized texts recorded in the urban environment of major cities in the Russian Federation, which were used as stimulus material. The research is based on the examination of the perception and memorization of vandalized texts through a laboratory experiment using an eye-tracker (sample size - 20 individuals). It was found that 19 to 67% of vandalized texts are remembered upon single exposure (13 seconds). Political texts exhibit the highest memorability, while creolized texts based on language play receive positive evaluation. The most vulnerable to the potential of "soft power" in vandalized texts is the immersive eye-catching strategy of respondents. The authors conclude that vandalized texts are easily remembered, attracting the observer's attention through unique linguistic devices in text organization.

LA English
DT Article
DE environmental protest; neopatrimonialism; Bashkortostan; environmental
   mobilisation; national organisations; framing
AB . In recent years the number of environmental protests in Russian regions has been on the rise, despite the shrinking political opportunity structure. In the Bashkortostan republic, the Bashkir Soda Company's (BSC) decision to develop the Kushtau Hill for soda ash provoked an environmental campaign to save the mountain. The Kushtau Hill movement succeeded, despite the highly repressive response from regional government and its tight patrimonial link to the BSC - two conditions identified in the literature as unfavorable to protesters. How is environmental discontent successfully mobilised under a repressive government and embedded extractive practices? Drawing on semi-structured interviews with activists, I trace two interlinked pathways to successful mobilisation. The first one testifies to the role played by national organisations in sustaining environmental collective action. Under a shrinking opportunity structure for formal ENGOs, the Bashkir national organisation "Bashkort" provided the emerging movement with its experience of informal organisation. Its leadership successfully linked ethnic grievances to environmental mobilisation by claiming the Bashkirs' special relation to the mountain. However, ethnic and neighbour ties did not prevent a repressive response from the regional government due to a limited scale of the mobilisation. The second story deals with framing processes that expand the scope of potential supporters beyond particularistic ties. Protesters highlighted the perceived costs of neopatrimonialism to justify their demands. This framing put the republic head as a scapegoat who secured interests of the federal centre and BSC, compromising the residents' ecological well-being. Therefore, Kushtau Hill activists attracted new members, not putting themselves into danger of being perceived as extremists that targeted a regime-dimension.

AB USAID democracy promotion programs might not only influence the democracy levels, but also increase the likelihood of revolutionary uprisings in the recipient states. Democracy promotion can strengthen political opponents of the incumbent regime via support for alternative media, civil society groups and political parties, on one hand, and, on the other, support democratic institutions that in contrast to autocracies are more tolerable towards political opponents and thus allow more room for expressing political will on the streets. Since democracy aid targets "democrats" who are less prone to exert armed violence, the authors expect it to be associated with unarmed uprisings. Using logit regression models, they find that the volume of the USAID financial democracy assistance appears to be a significant predictor of unarmed revolutionary destabilization, but its effect is relatively weak. Some particular sub-sectors of democracy assistance have an impact on revolutionary destabilization, namely: civil society, elections, human rights and media assistance. These correlations might be partly explained by the fact that USAID assistance goes disproportionately to anocracies. This aid tends to increase the probability of revolutionary destabilization in two ways - directly (through strengthening political opponents of the regime) and indirectly (through increasing the number of anocracies in the world).

AB The author recalls the reveries of the times of the creation of the journal Polis. He critically assesses three decades of attempts to nurture the achievements of world political science. He admits that the results of these efforts are far from expectations. The reasons are the haste to act and our miopic vision of the standards of world political science, as well as the awkward backwardness of these standards themselves. The generic trauma of the newly emerging political science goes with the reductive adjusting of evolving practices of political goalattainment to the straitjacketing models of jurisprudence, philosophy and history. As Ch. Tilly has shown, the corresponding pernicious postulates were questioned only during the glorious twenty years of political science renewal in the 60s and 70s of the last century. These pernicious postulates are related to the reduction of evolving political phenomena to simplistic mechanistic schemes and abstractions. They continue to dominate mainstream political science. As for the alternative possibilities of political science, they require taking into account the spatio-temporal variability of political phenomena and using an expanding and increasingly complex research apparatus. The author gives a number of examples of such sophisticating renewal, including the treatment of the existence of nations as everyday referendum (Renan), of diverse polities as mestorazvitiya (evo-localizings, lit. place-developments) (Savitsky), of political institutions as conceptual variables (Nettl), of crises as alternating phases of dissynchronization and resynchronization (Almond and colleagues), of center-periphery polarization (Rokkan). The article also mentions the efforts of R. Dahl and F. Schmitter to "save" modern democracy from various kinds of reductions by reinterpreting it in terms of polyarchy and accountability. It refers to the geochronopolitics of G. Modelski and further similar ventures of V. Tsimburski. It also cites efforts of A. Melville and his colleagues in correcting the reductive rendering of the global community of states by extending the factual scope multidimensionality of its analysis. Further cases include the fuller and more multidimensional consideration by G. Tsebelis and R. Putnam of alternative policies and aspirations in terms of nested, two- and multidimensional games, and finally, the efforts of W. Patzelt to instigate an evolutionary morphology of politics.

No matter how the concept of logical positivism is buried by "continental philosophy", or ideologically motivated philosophers, or even the latest initiatives of the contemporary philosophy of science, the scientific worldview remains invariant. The traditions of the work of logical positivists remain relevant both for the development of modern philosophy of science and as guidelines indicating the way to get rid of the idle talk ("meaninglessness") of political slogans and manifestos.

TI The International Climate Psychology Collaboration: Climate
   change-related data collected from 63 countries

AB Climate change is currently one of humanity's greatest threats. To help scholars understand the psychology of climate change, we conducted an online quasi-experimental survey on 59,508 participants from 63 countries (collected between July 2022 and July 2023). In a between-subjects design, we tested 11 interventions designed to promote climate change mitigation across four outcomes: climate change belief, support for climate policies, willingness to share information on social media, and performance on an effortful pro-environmental behavioural task. Participants also reported their demographic information (e.g., age, gender) and several other independent variables (e.g., political orientation, perceptions about the scientific consensus). In the no-intervention control group, we also measured important additional variables, such as environmentalist identity and trust in climate science. We report the collaboration procedure, study design, raw and cleaned data, all survey materials, relevant analysis scripts, and data visualisations. This dataset can be used to further the understanding of psychological, demographic, and national-level factors related to individual-level climate action and how these differ across countries.

AB Effective communication increases support for policy measures. This article argues that a narrative that portrays a policy's target group as a hero is most effective in generating support for the given policy. The research builds on the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) to test the influence of an audience-as-hero narrative on the opinion about a new campfire regulation among visitors to a national park in Russia. A survey experiment with 314 visitors to the national park compares the influence of a narrative portraying the regulation's target group as a hero (a park visitor) on policy opinion and a narrative portraying another hero (a firefighter). Results show that the audience-as-hero narrative has more influence on policy support than a nonnarrative message and also more than a narrative portraying another hero. This indicates that audience-as-hero narratives are particularly effective in generating support for policies.

TI The nonlinear road to happiness: Making sense of ESGD impacts on
   well-being

AB This study examines the heterogeneous impact of environmental, social, governance, and digital (ESGD) factors on subjective well-being across 86 countries from 2005 to 2019, using Method of Moments Quantile Regression. The results reveal complex, nonlinear relationships between ESGD factors and well-being. CO2 emissions display an inverted U-curve, suggesting eventual negative impacts after initial gains. Our findings suggest that renewable energy only benefits higher quantiles, revealing affordability issues. Social and governance factors like labor participation and women's political participation relate nonlinearly to well-being across income levels, reflecting employment quality and social norms differences. Similarly, digital factors improve well-being in high-income countries but not lower-middle-income nations, due to economic complexity gaps and the digital divide. A "digital economy paradox" emerges where more digital skills combined with limited digital economies decrease well-being in lower-middle income countries signifying the need for tailored digital policies. This study enhances understanding of links between ESGD factors and well-being patterns.

DT Article

   anachronism
ID HISTORY
AB The article examines the emerging field of reenactment studies. Three key components of reenactment are analyzed: the political, cultural and cognitive. It is proved that the latter is extremely poorly reflected in reenactment studies, which borrow from popular culture the leveling of any oppositions, including the opposition of "high" and "low", "professional" science and "popular" opinion. It is the weak demand for the cognitive component, combined with the playful nature of popular culture, that determines the uncertainty of temporal boundaries both in historical reconstruction itself and in reenactment studies, which maximally equate the researcher with participants in reconstruction practices. Next, a comparative analysis of the methodological settings of reconstruction and memory studies is carried out. The main thesis of the article is to prove the multidirectionality of their temporal settings: memory studies seek to clarify the boundaries between past and present, and reenactment studies seek to use and aesthetically play up their uncertainty.

DT Article
DE transatlantic relations; bilateral institutes of cooperation;
   international se- curity; bilateral trade and investment
AB The article is dedicated to current state of affairs and perspectives of institutionalization of US-EU relations. Due to different international and domestic political reasons, after the 2020 the two sides declared a rapprochement. The US is likely to remain the most influential center of power of the current system of international affairs. Due to the process of European integration, the EU acquired an ability to behave as an international actor and the US' global partner. An ambitious bilateral agenda includes not only pragmatic goals, but a long-term intention to cooperate. Institutions of bilateral relations are supposed to build strategic partnership regardless of concrete political situation. The period from 2021 to 2023 were favorable for such efforts, because of the White House retreat from the isolationist foreign policy. The article explores different formats of cooperation between the US and the EU with special focus on high level cooperation. Interparliamentary connections between the US Congress and European Parliament play a special role in institutionalizing the relations. Special attention is paid to the new frameworks of executive branch cooperation, such as Council for Trade and Technology, as well as a number of Strategic Dialogues on different topics. Institutionalization of bilateral relations is aimed at consolidation of economic and technological resources for strategic confrontation against China.

ID DOUGLAS PRODUCTION FUNCTION; GOVERNANCE
AB This study scrutinizes the impact of corruption on the economic growth of five emerging countries, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS), over the period 1996-2020. The study has employed panel quantile regression and the two-stage least square regression technique. Empirical results of the study confirm that control of corruption, population, political stability, and gross capital formation shows a positive impact on economic growth, whereas the impact of trade openness and government spending on economic growth is insignificant. Therefore, according to the current study, regulations must be strengthened to manage corruption better, i.e., there is a need to strengthen institutional apparatus in the study area, which will encourage economic development. Additionally, BRICS economies' officials need to pursue policies that will expand with more investment and, ultimately, investment spending, which will increase after corruption is effectively controlled. This proposition is in line with the Keynesian school of thought.

AB How does inclusion in social policy programs strengthen individuals' support for redistribution, and lead to spillovers in support for future social policy programs? We study a unique dataset of 1,300 Moscow residents to estimate the effect of participating in a government-sponsored redevelopment program on preferences for redistributive social policy. Our design exploits features of the program designed to foster institutional trust by engaging citizens in the policy design process. We report a positive effect: individuals in buildings slated for redevelopment are more likely to agree that the government should reduce income differences between rich and poor, provide for the unemployed, and provide public housing. Our findings suggest that increased trust in the government is a channel through which program participation affects redistribution preferences, show how programs can be used strategically to promote a redistributive agenda, and suggest a pathway for the co-persistence of redistribution preferences and redistributive state policies.

AB Identity leadership captures leaders efforts to create and promote a sense of shared group membership (i.e., a sense of "we" and of "us") among followers. The present research report tests this claim by drawing on data from 26 countries that are part of the Global Identity Leadership Development (GILD) project to examine the relationship between political leaders' identity leadership and civic citizenship behavior (N = 6787). It also examines the contributions of trust and economic inequality to this relationship. Political leaders' identity leadership (PLIL) was positively associated with respondents' people-oriented civic citizenship behaviors (CCB-P) in 20 of 26 countries and civic citizenship behaviors aimed at one's country (CCB-C) in 23 of 26 countries. Mediational analyses also confirmed the indirect effects of PLIL via trust in fellow citizens on both CCB-P (in 25 out of 26 countries) and CCB-C (in all 26 countries). Economic inequality moderated these effects such that the main and indirect effects of trust in one's fellow citizens on CCB-C were stronger in countries with higher economic inequality. This interaction effect was not observed for CCB-P. The study highlights the importance of identity leadership and trust in fellow citizens in promoting civic citizenship behavior, especially in the context of economic inequality.

AB The paper, written on the basis of all-Russian sociological surveys in 2021-2023, examines the attitude of Russian society to the Special Military Operation in Ukraine (SMO). On the basis of the comparison of empirical data characterising this attitude, the dynamics of the attitude towards the SMO is studied. A detailed description of socio-psychological differences in Russians' assessment of the special military operation, its consequences, as well as the impact of the SMO on the social behaviour of Russians is given. An analysis of correlations between the relevant sociological indicators allows the authors to create a social typology of these differences and to explain their emergence in the context of value orientations, world outlook, personal life successes, trust in authorities of different levels and emotional dominance in the perception of Russian reality. A sociological characterisation of Russians' involvement in various forms of support for the participants of SMO and their families, in particular, in the development of the volunteer movement, is given. The article pays special attention to analysing the connection between the variety of views on Russia's development paths and the differences in the assessments of its policy and its actions in Ukraine. Based on empirical research, the authors show that the implementation of the SMO has influenced the balance of opinion on Russia's development model in the direction of an increase in the share of its citizens who believe that Russia is a separate civilisation and should not live according to the rules set by the West. The ongoing dispute between the adherents of the country's original way of development and their Western- oriented opponents has to a greater or lesser extent affected the assessment of various aspects of the SMO and its consequences. However, the line of demarcation between these historical traditions does not overlap with the line of demarcation of positions on the SMO, which has not led to a frontal split in Russian society.

AB Within the framework of the methodology of system modeling and concept analysis, as well as by using a previously developed model of evolutionary cycles of the world political and economic system, supplemented by a model of transmission of leadership and its dysfunctions in the vicinity of the "singularity" of global development, a hypothesis has been formulated to explain the features of the current degradation of the unipolar world order, clarifying its time frame and possible cumulative geo-economic and geopolitical consequences. The possibility of evolutionary transformation of the unipolar world order into a different kind of global order, built on fundamentally different organizational principles, which are not hierarchical, but rather structured like a network, is explored. Among the systemic reasons for such degradation, the most important are, firstly, the evolutionary dead end of the monopolar design of a complex system. Within the framework of such a system, both organic transmission of leadership and institutional and normative-value continuity between the elites of the old and new leader are impossible. Under these circumstances, the hegemon of the monopolar world order is forced, driven by the interests of self-preservation, to destroy the foundations of the system it itself created. Another no less important systemic reason pointing to the inevitability of "creative destruction" of the traditional hierarchically organized world order is the inertia of the prospects for global development for the subjects and actors of world politics operating today, as well as the structural and functional "poverty" of mainstream models of world socio-political and economic changes in the coordinates of global ordering/disordering. Based on the analysis of the primary symptoms of the widespread awakening of actors to subjective activity that has swept the entire modern world, qualitatively new communities have been identified - growth points of new orders, proto-institutions, norms and value orientations, potential structures of political subjectivity.

AB In Ukraine, China continues to adhere to the policy of "neutrality benevolent towards Russia", remaining "above the fray" and at the same time looking for its place in the conflict as a "mediator" that does not condemn Russia, but does not recognize the transfer of part of Ukrainian territories to Russia. However, in Chinese society and the expert community controlled by the Communist Party of China (CPC), the attitude towards the Ukrainian crisis is changing. If at the initial stage of Russia's Special Military Operation (SMO) in Ukraine, pro-Russian sentiments prevailed in the context of the Taiwan problem: "Russia is doing well!", "And we need it!" Today, the angle is different: "neither for Russia, nor against", with the addition that "the situation in Ukraine interferes with the normalization of China's relations with the West and, above all, with the EU". At the same time, Beijing is still interested in Russia as the main factor of "pressure on the United States" in the Sino-American confrontation. China's two-tiered approach to Ukraine and Russia was manifested in Beijing's reaction to the "Wagner" PMC mutiny. The official authorities limited themselves to a short statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry: "what happened is an internal affair of Russia". At the same time, the situation around "Wagner" caused active discussions in Chinese social networks. Their main topics were the following: how stable the situation inside Russia is, how what happened can affect Sino-Russian relations, and the development of the SMO in Ukraine. In the past three months, Beijing has stepped up its foreign policy. High-level contacts were organized with the U.S. and the EU, conciliatory proposals were made to Japan and South Korea. However, this has not yet led to an improvement in relations, although, according to Beijing's expectations, it may lay the foundations for normalization in the future. In other areas, progress was achieved where the PRC directed its financial resources - Latin America, Africa, Central Asia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc. Relations deteriorated with those contrary, believe that economic growth rates turned out to be moderately high compared to a low base in 2022. The PRC is starting to react more aggressively to U.S. sanctions. A set of laws has been formed that impose restrictions on foreign companies within China. At the same time, there is a belief in the country that foreign businesses interested in the Chinese market will themselves bypass U.S. restriction countries which improved their ties with the United States - India and the Philippines. Despite some personnel changes the internal political situation remains stable. Xi Jinping' promotion as China's "chief ideologue" in the "new era" continues. Without exception, all CPC members study Xi's writings on "socialism with Chinese characteristics in a new era" every day. At the end of June, Xi talked at a group study of the Party's Central Committee members about "sinified Marxism", the importance of combining "Marxism and Chinese civilization". China's main problems are in the area of the economy. According to foreign experts, China's GDP growth rate is too low. Chinese analysts, on the

ID WAR
AB The revival of the "great power competition" as a modern-day paradigm of international relations boosts certain forms of interstate rivalry that can be simultaneously effective and correspond to certain levels of acceptable cost-benefit balance. This includes the phenomenon of foreign interference into the domestic affairs of sovereign states. Research on this topic by foreign and Russian authors can be divided into two closely intertwined, but problematically different blocks: the former make attempts to theoretically understand the very concept of "interference", while the latter focuses primarily on the phenomenon of "interference" as an element of strategic competition. While the former is primarily focused on clarifying the "contents" of the interference, the latter, in essence, is devoted to understanding its "form" with an emphasis on the actions of states. This paper seeks to determine the place of "interference" within the overall framework of interstate rivalry, to clarify the content and the definition of the very concept. It seeks to identify the motives for interference, construct their hierarchy, pair them with types of actions, and on this basis present a "ladder of escalation of interference" similar to the "ladders of escalation" of other types of military-political conflicts. The construction of such a model intends to help organize analysis and improve predictive capabilities on the issue of interference into domestic affairs and facilitate the adoption of more effective decisions in this area by policy-making circles.

   world order
ID RETHINKING
AB The article is devoted to the study of the possibility of representing the world order in theologo-political optics based on the doctrine of the katechon as a force restraining the onset of the end of the world. The heuristic potential of this approach is expressed, firstly, in the demonstration of the world order as a spatio-political projection of katechonic temporality, and secondly, in the reception of political realism in the guise of "political katechonism". For this purpose, a brief historical and hermeneutic digression into the problem of interpretation of the Second Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Thessalonians was first carried out and a sketch of conceptual reconstruction was proposed, presenting it as the quintessence of New Testament political realism. The culmination of this tradition is C. Schmitt's idea of the katechon as a historical force that produces the spatio-temporal order of the Christian empire, the collapse of which led to the transformation of the katechon into a secular security state. The influence of C. Schmitt on the realistic approach to the world order can be traced, in particular, in H. Morgenthau's perception of the international balance of power systems through the prism of the concept of "the holder of the balance", which is in reality traced from the concept of "katechon". The conclusion asserts the idea that there is no alternative in the foreseeable future to the idea of a historical force restraining political anomie on a global scale and delaying the final catastrophe. From this point of view, differing variants of the architecture of the world order do not fundamentally affect its theological (katechonic) foundations

AB Why do democratization and gender quotas help to empower women politically in some countries, but not in others? This article addresses the question both theoretically and empirically by recognizing the role of historical legacies, and it contributes to the literature by analyzing the contested legacy of communism in women's political representation. The main theoretical argument of the article focuses on post-communist politicians' and citizens' hatred toward everything that reminded them of the communist era after the collapse of the system, including the "woman question." These politicians and citizens resisted legislative quotas and other pro-women democratic measures, viewing them as Soviet artifacts and symbols of top-down, state-forced women's liberation. Therefore, ceteris paribus, exposure to communist rule in the past might reverse or nullify the otherwise positive effect of democratization and gender quotas on women's political empowerment. This hypothesis is tested empirically using a comprehensive sample of 116 countries spanning the years 1991-2015. The findings indicate that the communist past does indeed overshadow the well-established positive influence of democratization and gender quotas upon female political empowerment. A comparative exploration of post-communist Poland and the Czech Republic illustrates the argument further and allows consideration of additional explanatory factors.

AB The article is the first part of our systematic review of substantive findings of fifth-generation revolution studies, building on the examination of the emergence and characteristics of this generation contained in the first article in the series. Our systematic review is divided into two parts. This first part specifically considers the following areas of research explored by fifth-generation scholars: First, we examine the factors and causes of armed and unarmed revolutionary events. These include economic, political, socio-demographic, and other factors, the majority of which exert a differential effect on the probability of armed versus unarmed revolutionary destabilization. Second, we examine the factors that influence the decision of participants to adopt a violent or non-violent tactic in revolutionary action. This analysis considers the structural factors, which are dependent on external conditions, and the agent factors, which are dependent on the characteristics of revolutionary movements. Third, we analyze the emergence of concepts such as 'coupvolutions' and 'analogues of revolutions' within the context of the fifth generation of the theory of revolution. Finally, we examine the phenomenon of the spread of revolutionary events, which is also known as revolutionary waves or the 'diffusion' of revolutions, and the mechanisms that drive it.

AB There are grounds for claiming that a new ('fifth') generation of revolution studies has emerged in the 21st century. It can be noted that the characteristics of this generation are as follows: a tendency toward a macro-level outlook, encompassing both historical and geographical dimensions, coupled with a propensity toward a systemic approach; study of distinct types of revolutionary processes, such as Mark Beissinger's 'urban civic revolutions', and the pivotal revolutionary innovations, including the impact of new information technologies in recent revolutions; innovations regarding the factors and causes of revolutions and innovations in the analysis of the factors influencing the choice of revolutionary strategy and revolution outcomes; a special interest in the topic of revolutionary waves/'the diffusion of revolution'; a strong understanding that armed and unarmed revolutionary events are characterized by significantly different factors, structure, and consequences; a focus on the study of unarmed revolutionary episodes/'non-violent maximalist campaigns'; the use of global databases of revolutionary events; extensive use of modern methods of quantitative analysis.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of Russian Muslims' communications in social networks. I show a unique mode of interdependence of online and offline, which takes shape in the special context of the dominant discourse of traditional Islam and the securitization of Islamic activism. The construction of "right" and "wrong" Islam determines the special structure of media consumption of Russian Muslims and the content of the political agenda. In addition to verbalized political agendas, I describe the phenomenon of an "unspoken" political agenda hidden beyond religious messages and identified precisely only through background by actors transmitting it.

AB Introduction. Awareness of the commonality of geopolitical and civilizational challenges of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus pushes for deepening integration cooperation in different directions. Close attention is paid to the problem of security, interpreted in an expanded way. Its provision correlates with the strengthening of the humanitarian dimension of the Union State, including the formation of a unified educational space. In modern conditions, its correlation with the consolidation of the policy of patriotic education in the integration field is being actualized. The purpose of the article is to identify the specifics of their coupling, taking into account the dynamics of union construction. Materials and Methods. The research is based on the methods of binary comparison, traditional and discourse analysis of official texts. An additional method is a formalized correspondence expert survey. The key materials are normative legal acts of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, interstate, intergovernmental and integration agreements, information content of the web resources of the Union State. The theoretical and methodological foundations of the research are a new political institutionalism, a multidimensional model of social action, and the paradigm of "political unification". Results. The article describes the normative foundations of state policy in the field of education and integration guidelines in the cultural and humanitarian plane within the framework of the movement towards the Union educational space. The demanded categories of the axiological plan are revealed, referring to the relationship between education and upbringing. The key lines of discursive practices at the sites of the union institutions are shown. The understanding of the need to adapt education systems to the requirements of the time and the linking of patriotic education with the protection and preservation of common historical memory are emphasized. Discussion and Conclusion. The results of the study and expert assessments suggest the articulation of not only positive changes, but also urgent vectors for improving national approaches and integration solutions. They correspond to the elimination of conflicts, the development and adoption of new documents at the level of the Union State, the implementation of value categories and new areas of unified policy. The results obtained may be of interest to public authorities and union institutions, participants in patriotic education in the territory of the Union State.

AB Currently, the Arctic region is experiencing a political crisis associated with a sharp limitation of the Arctic Council activities. The complex geopolitical situation was initiated unilaterally by the states of the collective West, which consistently led to a new strategic confrontation between Russia and NATO. The article analyses the main trends and activities of the members of the North Atlantic Alliance in the Arctic, which directly indicate the formation of policies and tools to contain Russia in the region. The author emphasises that Sweden and Finland's NATO accession increases tension, creates challenges and threats to the Russian national security in the light of the international military development. The consistent growth in the activity and presence of NATO in the region after the start of the special military operation (SMO/SVO) is traced and detailed. It is stated that the potential opportunities for Russia-NATO dialogue in the Arctic are decreasing. The article examines the Russian Federation's response measures to strengthen national security in the region. The author makes a conclusion that there is the need for improvement a comprehensive system for monitoring the situation in the Arctic in order to negate the possibility of incorrect interpretation of military activity in the context of the current phase of crisis. It is indicated that the further affairs in the Arctic are closely dependent on the results of the SMO.

AB Sub-Saharan Africa in general and West Africa in particular are ranked as one of the most unequal regions of the world. This study aims at investigating the direct effect of inequality on economic growth and human development (HD). To assess this effect, we use three variables and rigorous estimation techniques. The indirect effect of inequality on the economic growth-HD nexus in West Africa is analyzed with a view to identifying ways of realigning the policies to bring down inequality in West African economies. For this, we compare different standpoints on how inequality affects this nexus. Then, we run fixed effect panel regression and random effect panel regression on various models to test the hypotheses. We find that the positive impact of inequality on HD and economic growth in the most developed economies of the region results from deliberate policies coupled with strong economic and socio-political foundation.

SO REGIONOLOGIYA-REGIONOLOGY RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF REGIONAL STUDIES

DT Article
DE multi-ethnic regions; North Caucasus; Russian youth; all-Russian
   identity; ethnicity; ethno cultural interaction; conflict risks
AB Introduction. In multi -ethnic regions, which include the North Caucasus and the South of Russia in general, reducing the risks of identity conflict, in particular the conflictogenic potential of ethnic identity, is one of the priority tasks of public administration. The object of this policy, first of all, is the youth of the region, from whose ranks the activists of protest movements are recruited. This situation requires monitoring the social well-being of young people in the context of the combination of all -Russian and ethno-confessional identity. The aim of the study is to identify conflictogenic risks arising in the process of sociocultural interaction in multi -ethnic youth communities of border regions. Materials and Methods. The empirical basis of the research state of social identity of youth in the North Caucasus was the results of surveys conducted by the authors in March - April 2022 and 2023 among students of regional universities. It was assumed that the aggravation of the geopolitical situation and a special military operation acted as a trigger for the transformation of the social identity of youth, which has a different trajectory for groups of youth representing the peoples of the North Caucasus and Russians living in the region. An emotional assessment of closeness with communities of different taxonomic series made it possible to establish the significance of all -Russian identity in comparison with ethnic, regional and confessional ones. Results. A comparative analysis of the collected material indicates that the most significant consolidating values and symbols that unite the youth of the region are the common state and state symbols. By choosing these values, as well as the values of Russian culture and the general historical past, young people who consider themselves to be the peoples of the North Caucasus have come closer to the value profile of Russian youth in the region. In the consciousness of Russian youth, there is a growth in sociocultural values, the significance of which in their ideas has approached all -Russian civil and political values. There continues to be a trend aimed at sociocultural integration and erasing ethnocultural differences among the youth of the groups under consideration. Discussion and Conclusion. All -Russian and ethnic identities among young people living in the region are complementary, not competitive. The challenges the country faces are viewed by them as personal and socially significant. This trend is becoming a significant factor that reduces the conflict -generating risks of ethnocultural foundations of identity in youth communities of the North Caucasus. Scientific results will contribute to the understanding of sociocultural threats and risks of conflict in multiethnic youth communities of frontier regions, and will be useful to the scientific community and government authorities.

AB The idea of dialogue became the unspoken "core" of the EU - Latin America interregional relations, where the creation of the network of trade agreements played an important role, in which the EU was able to succeed noticeably. This article is devoted to political aspects of the chain of trade agreements with Latin America created by the European Union as one of the foundations of the whole complex of interregional relations that develop in accordance with the priority of economy over politics. The nature of development of each of these routes of interaction, the results, as well as the barriers that the EU-LAC dialogue faces, make it possible to identify the possibilities and limits of cooperation between the two regions in the face of increasing struggle for influence in the Western Hemisphere. The paper explores the main trade agreements: EU-Mexico, EU-Chile, EU - Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, EU-Caribbean, EU - Central America, and EU-MERCOSUR. The author concludes that the changes that have taken place at the international level, as well as in Europe and the LAC in recent years, with the increasing influence of new global players in Latin America, primarily China, yet again calls into question European leadership in this part of the world. It was the feeling of "closeness" that became an important factor in China's rapid expansion in Latin America, which Brussels has not paid due attention to in recent years. And this has led to the fact that the idea of confronting the growing struggle for influence in the Western Hemisphere has gradually become a red thread that belittles EU strategy in Latin America.

AB The development of digital law is inevitable, and all its branches should have a legislative basis for working in digital space. For these purposes, it is necessary to prepare a legal framework without digitalizing law for the sake of expediency. The authors aim to study the concept, content, and nature of the digitalization of law in the modern world. The article examines an important area of scientific research: a state mechanism for ensuring and protecting digital human rights; an optimal legal compromise between the possibility of law enforcement bodies to access information and the right of citizens to confidentiality. The main research method is deduction which allows the authors to study the legal and social nature of digitalization processes in the modern world. The authors also use induction, systematic scientific analysis, and comparative-legal and historical methods. The method underlying the solution to the problem is a comparative-legal study of the digitalization of law. The authors classify and analyze the digitalization of law and related social processes and study legal mechanisms for the digitalization of patent services and law firms (as exemplified by the digitalization of legal relations to protect the ownership of intellectual products). It is concluded that the use of remote e-voting will allow identifying new scientific approaches to amending the constitutions and charters of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation in the science of constitutional law. In practice, it will bring significant positive trends that promote social justice, the efficiency of public administration, and anti-corruption.

AB Recent studies show that the global increase in gender equality does not reduce gender differences in values. These findings somewhat undermine the social role theory and increase the need for additional explanations. These findings also imply that gender differences in val ues may stem from some underlying universalities that persist even through changes associated with socio-economic development. This gives us reason to explore an evolutionary perspective on gender dif- ferences in values. We discuss evolutionary mechanisms that could underlie certain universal gender differences in values, and then test whether these differences are truly universal across the world (we use data from World Values Survey to search for empirical support for our evolutionary hypotheses). We provide evidence for the global scale of gender differences in religiosity, family values, political val- ues, and pro -social values through our calculations.

AB . The influence of Internet communication on "street" protest activity is the focus of this paper. In recent years, there has been some stagnation in this area of research: a shortage of breakthroughs that would indicate new research directions or at least significantly strengthen the empirical foundation of the already established hypotheses. The paradox is that when considering the impact of the global network on political behavior, the network aspect itself, reflecting the structural characteristics of information exchange, remains on the far periphery of the research field. In this work, we try to partially fill this gap by proposing a set of concepts that, on the one hand, are "rooted" in network analysis, and on the other, reflect the important properties of the interaction of individuals within the framework of online and offline political mobilization. The simultaneous focus on the configuration of networks and the dynamics of participation also determines the approach to building such a theory - formal modeling. A key feature of the model's design is the identification of two structures in the overall communication system: core (strong offline ties) and augmented (core network plus online connections). The constructed model made it possible to strictly define the key concept - the network mobilization capacity, and to test the hypotheses built on basis. Computational experiments show that the ratio of mobilization capacities of core and augmented networks is a strong predictor of the effect of Internet shutdown. Although specific features of the structure dynamics of networks, such as the activation of "broker" nodes, are of great importance, the paper also discusses the prospects for empirical operationalization of the concepts proposed by the author.

AB The article delves into the nuanced challenge of crafting a cohesive unionwide patriotic agenda amidst escalating global tensions fueled, in part, by value conflicts. It scru-tinizes the emergence of a patriotic discourse intricately woven into the institutional fabric of the Union State, the Russian Federation, and the Republic of Belarus, primarily steered by top political leadership at the domestic level. The overarching aim is to delineate the endur-ing themes and prevailing narratives within the political elites' patriotic discourse within the Union State, while exploring its potential conceptualization as a coordinating discourse to further integration objectives and as a countermeasure of "anti-soft power" against external value threats emanating from the collective West. Methodologically, the study draws upon discursive neo-institutionalism, employing qualitative content analysis of speeches delivered by the respective presidents of the two countries as its primary analytical approach. In the conclusions, the paper underscores the remarkable alignment between Russian and Belarusian stances on patriotic issues, particularly concerning their ideological underpinnings. Both underscore the imperative of safeguarding and preserving historical memory and traditional values as the cornerstone of their discourse. However, the analysis also sheds light on the conceptual complexities inherent in articulating sovereignty values by both participating countries. The practical implications underscore the necessity of further solidifying a shared socio-cultural space, harmonizing historical policies within both nations and within the Union State framework, and stimulating a "demand for integration" through the practi-cal implementation of the principal directives outlined in the 2021 package of integration decisions.

TI Elite Economics and Political Instability

LA English
DT Article
DE elites; state; political stability; economic growth; center-periphery
   model
AB The article puts forward a new version of elite theory based on the use of a macroeconomic production function depending on the number of the elites and the masses. At the same time, the production function of the elites is complemented with the distribution function, which determines the income structure of social groups and the level of inequality. Combining the two sides of the activity of the elites allows us to design a simple typology of political situations in the country and highlight the regime of revolutionary situation. A formal analysis of the model of production activity of the elites has shown that the phenomenon of over-accumulation of the ruling class has a noticeable destructive impact on economic growth only after a severe drop in its functioning effectiveness. The very deterioration of the quality of the political elite allows an unjustified increase in its size to manifest itself. We consider generalizations of elite model in relation to the case of the middle class and show the invariance of the previously obtained conclusions. We provide an interpretation of the macro-theory of the elites for the mega-level, when studying the world economic system as a combination of the center, periphery and semi-periphery. We consider four dimensions of the elite, with system paradigms being a new element within these dimensions. The influence of external historical events on the worldview of the elites and their actions is revealed using the examples of the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire, the collapse of the USSR and the beginning of the fall of the U.S. hegemony. For the center - periphery system, we test the production model of the elites with the help of statistical data from the World Bank; we build econometric dependencies that show a decrease in the effectiveness of the United States in managing global production

DE theory of motion; open interval; contact of regions; nonlocalized
   objects; continuum
AB In this paper, I continue the discussion with Evgeny V. Borisov that I began in the previous article. Thus, I continue the study of logical-mathematical problems, the beginning of the awareness of which was laid by the paradoxes (aporias) of Zeno of Elea about motion (Achilles and the Dichotomy). I propose an argument that is a successor to the Dichotomy of Zeno of Elea. According to the Dichotomy, a moving object cannot cover the entire interval [A, B], since it must first cover the first half of the entire distance, then the first half of the remaining distance, etc. From this one could conclude that an object that has passed through this entire sequence of intervals will not be localized in time and space, and, however, it must somehow exist in order for some additional action can move it to the point B. Due to the controversial nature of this reasoning, in the previous article, I proposed several stories such that, if they are true, then it should be concluded that moving objects at certain stages of their movement exist outside of space and time. Borisov correctly notes that in these stories there is no proof that we should accept such a strange mode of existence of moving objects, since we have no reason to valuate these stories as true. Responding to Borisov's criticism, I demonstrate the need to recognize such a mode of existence. I prove that the elastic collision of an impenetrable point object with a closed impenetrable wall forces us to recognize that this object is outside space and/or time at the collision stage. Let an object move from point 0 m to a wall located at point 1 m. Since there is no instant of time at which the object interacts with the wall, I propose that sentences are true not only in relation to instants of time, but also in relation to indices, which are intervals, passed from 0 s, including 0 s. Then we get: The rebounding object either (1) rebounds at the index [0 c, 1 c) (in which case it definitely exists at that index), or (2) it rebounds at the index [0 m, 1 m) (in which case it definitely exists at that index). In case (1), the object does not exist at any instant of time and at any point in space. In case (2), the object does not exist at any point in space.

AB The article examines the connection between coping strategies and socio-demographic characteristics of patients diagnosed with lung cancer. When collecting empirical material, the authors used a questionnaire to obtain data on socio-demographic indicators and the psychodiagnostic survey technique " Methods of Coping Behavior" by R. Lazarus (adapted by T.L. Kryukova). The respondents in this study were 78 patients of the Chelyabinsk Regional Clinical Center of Oncology and Nuclear Medicine, aged from 39 to 80, with malignant neoplasms arising from the epithelium of the tissue of large and medium bronchi, small bronchioles and alveoli. The results of the study are the following. (1) A clear difference between groups of respondents on the basis of "gender" is observed in the coping strategies "confrontational coping" and "positive reappraisal": the latter is significantly higher in women, while the former in men. The coping strategy "planning to solve a problem", which is weakly expressed in both men and women, is separately noted; its values are below the norm of the questionnaire. (2) A significant difference between groups of respondents on the basis of "professional status" is observed in the coping strategies "distancing" and "taking responsibility"; among non-working respondents they are much more pronounced. (3) A significant difference between groups of respondents based on age is observed in the coping strategies of "distancing", " seeking social support", " planning to solve a problem", and "positive reappraisal". Respondents in the 51-60 age group have the highest values of coping " seeking social support", "planning to solve a problem", "positive reappraisal", and the lowest "distancing". Respondents in the 61-70 age group have the lowest value compared to other groups of respondents and the norm of the questionnaire for the strategy "planning to solve a problem". Respondents in the 71- 80 age group have the highest value for the strategies "seeking social support" and "distancing", as well as a low value for "planning to solve a problem" in relation to the questionnaire norm. The results obtained can serve as a building block for the development of a scientifically based system of psychological support for both patients and medical personnel working with them at all stages of treatment: from diagnosis to remission.

AB Based on voting protocols and debate minutes for the Carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) hearings in the European Parliament in 2022-2023 the cases where positions of MEPs from political groups "Identity and Democracy" and "European Conservatives and Reformists" coincided with those of parliamentarians from other parties (particularly opponents from "The Left" and "The Greens") were analysed. These actions bypassing the "sanitary cordon" were explored together with the content of the CBAM, which made possible to identify the main motivations of MEPs' voting. Such cases of solidary vote allowed to evaluate the strength of this barrier, the applicability of theories of two-dimensional nature of ideological space and the prospects of coordinated actions of selected parties after the European parliament elections 2024. These ad hoc coalitions were facilitated by the differences in attitudes to amendments. Among significant factors ensured Eurosceptic MEPs to express the same views were reluctan & scy;e to transfer additional competences to the EU bodies and willingness to support the European industry. Supranationality and deindustrialisation are considered to be more imminent threats than climate change. The article explores a two-dimensional structure of ideological space of the given activity. Close relations between left-wing and right-wing parties could be explained by similarity of political views (i. e Euroscepticism in attributed not only to far-right politicians).

AB The article is aimed at solving a following significant problem of modern historical science: determination of the content and use by the imperial authorities of the Church as a mechanism for implementing this policy. The authors analyze the activities of the Russian Orthodox Church as part of the state system of the Russian Empire, which undertook the task of not only spreading Christianity among non -Russian and nonOrthodox peoples, but also the task of involving them in the all -Russian cultural, civil, economic and political space. Based on the analysis of materials on the Orenburg diocese history, we suppose an attempt to reconstruct the mechanisms of economic and social development of the "foreigners" population of the Southern Urals, used by the Russian Orthodox Church with the support of the state. The methodological basis of the study is the modernization theory, which examines "acculturation" as a methodology of research into the interaction and mutual influence of "foreign cultures". At present, historiography lacks special works that consider the Russian Orthodox Church as a necessary institution contributing to the acculturation of the subjects of the empire living on its outskirts. The main result of this study is the identification of the nature of the Russian Orthodox Church's activities targeting "foreigners" and their involvement in Russian cultural space. These activities include traditional missionary mechanisms on the example of the Orenburg Diocese, which at the turn of the 19th - 20th centuries included the Turgai and Ural regions with a significant number of nomadic and seminomadic auls. We generalized acculturation as Missions, established the degree of their effectiveness in terms of the formation of loyal layers of the autochthonous population of the Kyrgyz (Kazakh) Steppe.

AB In the article, the author examines the role of the institution of fasting as a means of constructing political and confessional identity within the context of the Tudor Church of England. The source base of the study comprises a range of documents, including doctrinal texts, theological works, authorised homilies, royal proclamations, and Acts of Parliament. The author examines the role of fasting in the mytho-ritual systems of both the Catholic Church and the major sixteenth- century Reformation movements, namely Lutheran, Reformed, and English. Moreover, he elucidates the commonalities and distinctive tenets associated with Catholicism's and Reformation's approaches to fasting. In the first part of the article below, the author assesses the role of ritual within the context of institutional theory of identity, its significance and function in the Middle Ages, and its evolution across various Reformation traditions. The author concludes that the institution of fasting, which provided both horizontal (communal) and vertical (politico- religious) types of loyalty, was an important instrument of social change through the transformation of its very nature during the English Reformation.

AB The article develops an approach to the conceptualization of "cultural citizenship", which is used to describe the issues of overcoming cultural differences ff erences in the process of integration and social inclusion. Cultural citizenship is one of the concepts that develop the paradigms of citizenship and civic consciousness that exist in the tradition of political theory and sociology of culture. The purpose of the article is to develop a sociological approach to "cultural citizenship", based on such existing family concepts as citizenship (membership), solidarity, identity. The fi rst part of the article compares the legal and sociological interpretations of citizenship and their relationship with the cultural aspect of citizenship. In the second part, based on this comparison, the subject and central problems of cultural citizenship in the social sciences are formulated. In the third part, two approaches to the definition fi nition of cultural citizenship are analyzed. The fi rst approach leans towards political theory and defines fi nes the state as a source of citizenship, focusing on legal instruments of integration. The second leans towards cultural sociology and defines fi nes community as a source of citizenship, focusing on integrative practices of cultural production. The analysis of the two approaches in the fi nal part actualizes the empirical study of cultural citizenship as a process implemented at the organizational level. Cultural citizenship, in this vein, is defined fi ned as the process of two-sided inclusion of 'strange' and 'different' ff erent' cultural traits of dominant and minoritarian social category with respect to the integrity of the dominant cultural variation. The main operationalization of the organizational level fi nds itself in "cultural institutions" (e.g., exposition halls, museums, libraries, etc.) that are supposed to play a key role in the cultural citizenship process.

DT Article
DE pluralism; ontology; temporality; critical realism
ID END
AB In the shift toward the Early Modern era, the end-centric temporality of the Middle Ages underwent a critical reevaluation, which spawned four distinct historical paradigms in the interplay between eschatology and politics. This article delineates these paradigms as follows: the revolutionary, where political constructs undergo a metamorphosis toward the eschatological, culminating in their complete dissolution within it; the progressive, in which political elements evolve in the direction of eschatological thought while retaining their distinct existence; the conservative, where political structures act to curtail the influence of eschatological expectations; and the post-apocalyptic, wherein both political and eschatological spheres merge into the economic, exemplifying the cultural logic of late capitalism. Utilizing process tracing as a methodological tool within the framework of critical realism, the study investigates the dynamic processes through which societies confront and potentially overcome apocalyptic scenarios. It reveals that poetic and political pluralism serves as a transformative mechanism, facilitating the potential overcoming of apocalyptic threats. However, this overcoming is only achieved in the progressive model, which is marked by the adoption of a polytheistic political myth and a clear separation between the domains of politics and ethics. In contrast, the post-apocalyptic model is characterized by a radical proliferation of apocalyptic narratives, which leads to the normalization and institutionalization of a metaphorical 'worldly hell.' In this context, the political and eschatological are reconstituted within the economic domain, signaling a shift to a new cultural and ideological paradigm dominated by capitalist ideology

DT Article

AB The development of such an immense strategic domain as an outer-space is based upon two pillars - civil and military. Space is a subject of competition between the most influential world powers, with the participation of state and inter-state structures, as well as private companies. Areas of panEuropean cooperation in the space sector are analyzed, including the participation of France and the EU and ESA, and the key and in some cases the leading role of France in these processes. The geopolitical significance of the outer-space in global competition and the evolution of the position of European powers and specifically of France in relation to the military component of space exploration are studied. Outer-space and cyber-space now are interpreted in Western military strategies as the fourth and the fifth "domains" of military operations, together with land-, sea- and air-domains. Western powers are coordinating and integrating their military-space activities. France and the governing structures of the European Union place an emphasis on assuring the strategic independence of Europe from the USA and from the technologies of "third countries" in space exploration, the military exploration of space included. The EU pays great attention to the formation and development of the "space economy" and the links between the state space programs with the private sector and private investments. The outerspace in the third decade of the XXI century has become a domain of everyday and constant activities of "space powers", and because of the role of space technologies in the areas of communications, internet and cell communications, geo-positioning, TV-broadcasting, etc. widely interfere in the life of all other states on the planet. The militarization of the outer-space in different formats is actively progressing and requires active political efforts to ensure its peaceful use.

ID POLITICAL ELITE
AB . The article aims to identify and examine the key trends and socio-political processes that are shaping the formation of a digital elite in the public-power sphere. It demonstrates that the transformation of system- forming elements of power, leading to the formation of new "power alliances", is largely hidden from social control, and the process of institutionalizing the digital elite as a stable privileged group is in its early stages. Representatives of this group exert managerial influence through such tools as digital platforms, new forms of control over various resources, and influence over the trajectories of the digital transformation of traditional political institutions: in the long term, this will allow them to influence both the public agenda and the adoption of socially significant decisions. The authors analyze the key trends in the development of the digital elite - the formation of new power relations and structures, as well as socio-political actors - "power alliances".

AB One of the goals of science diplomacy is to create a sound basis for increasing international scientific cooperation. The regional challenges specific to the countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), their cultural and historical commonalities contribute to the development of international collaborations in the region. The aim of the study is to describe the infrastructure formed by science diplomacy in the region, expressed in initiatives, organizational structures, joint projects and activities, and to quantify research collaborations in the region and with countries outside the region. The authors have visually presented the main actors of science diplomacy, the directions of their activities and their interrelationships creating a visual system of science diplomacy structure in the region. Our model of science diplomacy in the MENA countries also reflects significant developments in the field of science diplomacy in the region. The results of the publication activity analysis show that numerous science diplomacy projects appear to be having an effect, expressed in terms of an increasing level of scientific collaboration. Saudi Arabia is the main nucleus of these efforts in the region, with Egypt also playing a significant role. However, S&T cooperation with third countries is still a priority for countries in the region. A number of countries are poorly involved in the processes of regional scientific integration due to historical, institutional and political peculiarities. Morocco's science sector, which is quite active and largely self-reliant, stands somewhat apart.

ID INTERNATIONAL-RELATIONS
AB In international studies, there are many borrowings from other disciplines at the level of metaphors, concepts, etc. In this regard, the question is raised about a possible reverse transfer, i.e. from the sphere of world politics to other scientific spheres, including not only socio-humanitarian, but also the natural sciences. The article analyzes a successful example of such a transfer given by R. Axelrod in the early 2000s, as well as subsequent attempts to theoretically validate the conditions for export from the field of international studies to other areas. Two approaches have been identified. Within the framework of the first approach, it is proposed to create an interdisciplinary theory, since international relations are able to integrate various humanitarian and social disciplines. The second approach allows for a "pluralistic" and "blurred" subject field of the theory of international relations, in which various theoretical and methodological lines can coexist and enter into discussion with each other (societal multiplicity), rather than remain isolated. It provides opportunities for its "export" to other scientific fields. A critical analysis of these approaches allows us to conclude that in both the first and second cases, the political focus of international research is lost. The article substantiates the subject area of world politics as the exertion of political influence in the international arena by state and non-state actors. Based on this, the authors of the article put forward a third direction. The essence of it is that the search for the possibility of exporting from international research to other scientific fields does not lie in the creation of an interdisciplinary theory, and not in the formation of a "blurred" subject field that ensures "societal multiplicity", but in the similarity of the situations under consideration. The authors show that the degree of similarity of situations depends on a number of factors, including the behavior of actors/objects being in conditions that are relatively the same. Examples are given by comparing situations and theoretical concepts of international relations and world politics with situations and concepts in other scientific fields - meteorology, medicine, ethology. At the same time, the place of the "political" in other spheres is occupied by the dominant object/factor.

AB The strategic intent of the current U.S. administration to win a geopolitical victory over Russia with the help of Ukraine's nationalist elite is becoming a catastrophic reality, as the Russian Federation's special military operation and a series of failed "offensives" by Ukraine's armed forces evolve. Existential threat has forced the Russian state and civil society to mobilize in the shortest possible time armed forces, economy and military-industrial complex to repel the Western military proxy intervention. The scientific sociological information about the socio-political potential and reserves of the Russian society, its readiness, nature and degree of motivation for the defense of the Fatherland are of crucial importance for an effective management of the current disposition along Russia's western borders. The Scientific-analytical and informational work is complicated by the fact that the picture of the hybrid socio-political reality of the country's life is purposefully distorted by the enemy by means and channels of mass propaganda and communication in order to disinform the population and the armed forces. The empirical basis of the article is the data of sociological monitoring "How are you Russia?" about the current aspects of civil society life, based on the analysis of which conclusions are drawn about feasible resources and trends in the development of the socio-political situation in our country and the world. Sociological measurements in 2023, compared with data from previous years, allow us to conclude that Russian society has a high resource for socio-political stability and consolidation. Thus, an analysis of the structure of current anxiety showed that SVO did not have a critically destabilizing effect on the life of any group of Russian society. The share of those who believe that the political system needs to be radically changed decreased in 2023 to a minimum (16%) over the last 30 years of measurements. The overwhelming majority (73%) of Russians believe that the main threats to Russia come from abroad. The index of socio-political sustainability returned in 2023 to the zone of stable and sustainable development, reaching its highest value in 30 years of monitoring measurements. The noted positive trends show that Russia successfully continues the searching for a balance and symphony of interests in the modern hybrid social reality.

AB In the article the author for the first time analyzes legislative, religious and educational activities ofTatars in the Turgai region on the basis of archival, periodic, statistical sources. This ethnic minorityactivity is interesting from the point of view of studying the problem of interaction betweentheempire, the mobile diaspora and the local population in the context of the frontier modernizationprocess. The aim of the study is to identify the main results of religious and educational activity oftheTatar population in the region. The author comes to the conclusion that the main directions ofreligious-educational work were missionary activities of Tatars in Kazakh auls, construction ofmosques, functioning of mektebs and madrasas, theaters, libraries, public Muslim organizations,attempts to publish books, brochures and newspapers. Many of these initiatives were stronglyopposed by the empire. The result of the activities of the Tatar population was not only the mainte-nance of ethno-cultural diversity, but also a versatile influence on the Kazakhs manifested in the reli-gious, cultural, political sphere and in the formation of a multi-ethnic (Tatar-Kazakh) Muslim socio-cultural space of the empire, which became part of the global Islamic network community. The Tatarsspread the ideas of Jadidism and became competitors of the Russians in familiarizing the local popu-lation with European culture and pedagogy. The article is intended for specialists in the field ofhistory of Kazakhstan, Islam, Tatars, national policy of the Russian Empire.

AB The corpus of political science problems related to the development, security, and sovereignty of the state, which stimulates the increased interest of both government structures and representatives of the scientific community, also includes a new concept of 'food miles.' The deconstruction method and comparative analysis applied by the author showed that the semantic foundation of the terminological unit under consideration is based on the neorealist paradigm of international relations. The author seeks not only to highlight the epistemological gaps of the concept, but also to convert them into competitive advantages, thus contributing to the discourse related to the construction of 'improved food miles.' In the empirical part of the research, the author chose the agricultural policy of the Moscow region as an example, in particular, fixing the low food self-sufficiency of the region, compensated both by the intra-national commodity movement and the import of basic foodstuffs. For the first time, the dependence on the intensive import of foreign food products into the subject of the Russian Federation was compared with the degree of environmental damage identified using mathematical methods. The author concludes that the concept of 'food miles,' having replenished the categorical and conceptual apparatus of political science and the theory of international relations, can be used as a mechanism of 'green protectionism,' activating the protection of national interests and stimulating the diversification of domestic agroecological production. As a recommendation to state bodies, the author offers a plan of amendments to legislative acts, as well as a graphic project of ecological labeling of food products.

TI 'Anti Semitism in the West and in Post Soviet Russia

DT Article
DE anti-Semitism; Russia; West; anti-Jewish sentiment; Jews
AB Modern anti-Semitism, both in the West and in Russia, is built into xenophobia, is its expression and manifests itself at the everyday level, since state Semitism in European countries is prohibited by law. In post-Soviet Russia, the state anti-Semitism virtually disappeared and, at the same time, everyday anti-Semitism faded away. The Jewish question has lost its relevance; other problems have come to the forefront - corruption, poverty, lives, unemployment, the influx of migrants. The scope of Judeophobia, as shown bythe world geography of the Anti-Semitism Index, depends little on the political regime of the state and the degree of development of democracy in it. Comparison of the level of anti-Semitism in all forms of its manifestation in Russia and EU countries in 1990-2020 shows that anti-Semitism was declining in Russia, while in the EU itwas growing and that European Jews had to deal with Judeophobia much more often on various public platforms and in different institutional environments. In EU countries in 2018, 76 % of respondents reported an increase in anti-Semitism, while in Russia the figures were 7 %. The significance of the traditional reasons for hostility towards Jews in post-Soviet Russia has radically decreased, no less than 7 times, due to an almost seven-fold decrease in the number of the Jewish diaspora over the period 1989-2021. The reduction of Jewish participation in government and of representation in the elite, the narrowing of the sphere of interaction between the Jews and non-Jews left little room forjealousy, envy, competition and conflict, weakened anti-Jewish sentiment among Russians and other peoples.

   2019/452; FDI screening; mechanism; FDI monitoring
AB This article examines current trends in financial governance within the European Union (EU), focusing on the regulation of foreign direct investment (FDI). The adoption of supranational mechanisms for EU FDI screening through Regulation 2019/452 not only highlights the expansion of multi-level governance, as promoted by the European Commission, but also reconfigures the EU's role as a global actor in investment transactions. This shift directly impacts a wide range of stakeholders. The study aims to explore the institutional architecture established by Regulation 2019/452 and address the research question: Why has the EU transitioned from a neoliberal approach favoring free capital movement (negative integration) to a framework emphasizing common European monitoring rules (positive integration)? The theoretical framework combines the concept of multi-level governance and securitization theory, underpinned by new institutionalism, which facilitates an analysis of how institutions, particularly the European Commission, articulate and advance common interests within political frameworks. The findings reveal that the securitization of Chinese FDI served as a critical tool for the Commission to legitimize its push for supranational regulation. Regulation 2019/452 is identified as "entry-level legislation," designed to be amended through its built-in revision mechanism, ultimately broadening the Commission's exclusive competencies in this area. This trajectory was partially confirmed by the Commission's January 2024 proposal to strengthen the Regulation. The analysis situates this shift within a broader global context, demonstrating how the EU's move from neoliberalism to protectionism mirrors trends in other major economies, such as the United States, China, and India, all of which employ FDI monitoring mechanisms. The article also identifies key events that acted as catalysts for the EU's geopolitical reassessment of foreign investment-from a stance of openness to recognizing potential threats to collective security and public order. It draws a parallel with the Commission's use of securitization discourse in the energy sector, which contributed to the partial communitarization of energy policy through multi-level governance.

ID MOBILITY
AB The article analyzes the processes of adaptation of migrant workers to the transformations of the Russian labor market in 2010-2023. Two periods are distinguished: smooth changes in the labor market in the process of structural changes in the economy (2010-2019) and shock crises in 2020-2023. Special attention is paid to the latter period, when foreign workers were forced to adapt to extraordinary changes in the labor market due to the pandemic, as well as foreign and domestic political events after February 2022. In the 2010s, migrant workers gradually adapted to the transformations of the Russian labor market associated with changes in the structure of economic activities and in -demand occupations. A significant role was played by the reforms of migration legislation in 2013-2016, which simplified the procedures for their access to the Russian labor market, the restructuring of relations with employers, and a certain mutual understanding between migrants and the host population. The adaptive abilities of migrant workers were particularly evident during the extraordinary shocks in the labor market in the 2020s. Migrants from Central Asian states, taking advantage of the withdrawal from the market of competitors from other post- Soviet states, which they did not intend to leave, quickly returned to the labor market after the first wave of the pandemic, mastering new employment niches. Diversification of economic activities, narrowing of the wage gap with Russian citizens, reduction of illegal labor activities and informal employment are the most visible results of migrant workers' adaptation to changes in the labor market. Serious problems of the Russian labor market that do not contribute to the adaptation of migrant workers to it remain its segmentation with associated overqualification, underutilization of human capital, and the state's desire to routinize control and supervision over employers and foreign citizens. The article is based on sociological surveys of migrant workers and employers conducted in 2011-2023.

AB The article explores the conceptual landscape surrounding national interests. It posits that the identification, safeguarding, and advancement of national interests serve as the bedrock upon which state policies in the domain of national security are formulated. The article traces the origins, evolution, and contemporary interpretations of national interests. Special emphasis is accorded to interpretations espoused by proponents of the political realism. The author conducts an in-depth examination of Russian perspectives on national interests during the 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as throughout the Soviet era, presenting an original periodization of conceptual approaches within Soviet Russia and the USSR. In addition to its historical inquiry, the article critically assesses the implications of national interests of contemporary Russia's foreign policy. Through analysis of strategic policy documents, the author discerns instances where policy objectives are conflated with the national interests , diverging from their realization. Given Russia's distinctive geopolitical position and security challenges, the author defines the paramount Russia's national interest - establishing a secure periphery characterized by cooperative relationships with neighboring states and ensuring unimpeded access to global maritime routes.

   Educational Standard; basic and specialized higher education
AB The Russian system of the professional sociological education, if we date its institutionalization to the creation of the first sociological faculties in the USSR in 1989, has functioned for more than thirty years. However, in the coming years, this education will have the most difficult period in its development due to the transition to a new two -level model of higher education and to the adoption of the Federal State Educational Standard of the 4th generation (FSES 4). The implementation of these plans creates certain challenges: 1) sociological training would lose the status of an independent enlarged group of specialties (EGS) and would be included into the political sciences EGS; 2) the suggested program of joint training of sociologists with representatives of political sciences in the first two years of study would reduce the study time for mastering sociological academic disciplines; 3) there are certain contradictions between the basic and specialized levels of higher education due to the suggested expanded opportunities for basic -level graduates to enroll in graduate school. Moreover, such issues as the target numbers for the EGS, mechanisms for their distribution between areas of training and possibility of simultaneous training in 'related' specialties have not been resolved. These challenges create risks for sociology of maintaining its status of a specialty, and, ultimately, a threat to its independence and identity. The author suggests some measures to develop the professional sociological education and to maintain its status under the current reform of the national higher education system, which is primarily the restoration of the sociological EGS in the List of Areas of Training in Higher Education, which would make the new FSES 4 focus on the related areas of training and improve the quality of sociological education.

ID DEMOCRACY
AB A set of theoretical models are presented to explain the complex political dynamics in Russia in the 1990s.The parametric model is used to analyze the fluctuations of the political system in a conditional space defined by two axes: the scale of collegial division of power (CDP) and the level of state success. Major turning events as closely related structural changes shift the state of the political system along both axes. Political modernization occurs when success and CDP rise, while demodernization is defined as a decline on one or both scales. The contours model combines structure and agency processes and takes into account two contours of political dynamics. In the large - socio-political - contour, turning events affect grassroot structures and processes related to objective conditions of life, subjective moods, and behavioral attitudes of broad groups of the population. In the small contour (interactions of political actors with their rivalry and conflicts) the same turning events change the balance of power of the main players in national politics. The general principles of the dynamics of the CDP, state success in their interrelation, as a result of turning events as a consequence of the interaction of actors in the small loop under the influence of processes in the large loop are formulated. A step-by-step model explaining the natural shift to authoritarianism on the basis of these principles and under special conditions is proposed. Through these models, the mechanisms of conflict dynamics and socio-political processes of the 1990s in Russia are presented, when the processes of political modernization began to be combined with and then replaced by trends of demodernization.

ID MODERNIZATION
AB The article presents the results of a political-psychological study of the political values of Russian youth. The conceptual model of the study is based on an understanding of political values as semantic dominants of individual and group political consciousness. The empirical basis of the study was data from a survey of young people aged 14 to 30, conducted using survey procedures (n = 2500) and focus groups (n = 8). In the system of political values of Russian youth, the most significant are peace, security, justice, human rights, legality, freedom, order, and the least significant is nationalism. Young people's understanding of justice includes both rationalistic socio-economic and political-legal interpretations, as well as spiritual and moral meanings traditional for our mentality (truth, honesty, decency). At the same time, it is the traditional understanding of justice that directly correlates with the current demand of young people for sincerity and honesty in politics. Freedom, in terms of semantic content, combines historically established moral (including religious) and rationalistic principles. It is perceived by young people as independence, will (liberty), security. Patriotism is one of the ten most significant political values, but does not occupy a leading position. Most young people in our country consider themselves patriots. Among the traditional semantic lines of understanding patriotism, the position of "love for the Fatherland" is dominant, reflecting the emotional nature of young people's value-based attitude to their country. Russian youth are characterized by so-called paternalistic attitudes and orientations, which express their value-based attitude towards the state. Young people's ideas about the state include not only political, but also sociocultural components that have deep historical roots. In addition, young people perceive the state as the subject of the implementation of their political values. Traditionality itself, as an axiological concept, has little meaning that is not entirely defined for young people. As a result of the study, it is concluded that traditional components have been updated in the system of political values of modern Russian youth. They manifest themselves both at the level of the hierarchy of values and in the semantic content of axiological concepts.

ID DISCOURSE
AB The article presents the results of the analysis and systematization of discourses describing the dynamics and key areas of social development. The purpose of the study is to determine the guidelines and priorities in discussions on development that dominate the research and expert agenda, and to identify the ideas and meanings that are invested in this concept by actors participating in public discussions and political goal-setting. The research methodology is based on the structural and functional approach, and on comparative evaluation of the target settings present in the current expert discussion and in public policy- making. A quantitative content analysis of a sample of EU documents defining priorities of interaction with third countries to achieve development goals is offered as an illustrative example. The conclusions are presented in the form of a conceptual tree constructed by correlating the main concepts that exist in the research and expert field dealing with social development discourses and their political implications. According to the results of the study, the ideological appeal of narratives circulating in the public space of the "developed world" and the normative projection of this agenda worldwide transform discursive power into discursive hegemony through "green colonialism" and other forms of "promoting development". The authors take a critical approach to the monopolization of the expert and political field by the concept of "sustainable development" which is widely regarded as a politically correct approach and a universalist political attitude. An ambiguous understanding of "social development" beyond the progressive paradigm and purely normative approaches in the social sciences makes the need to clarify this concept all the more urgent. The paper proposes to interpret "political development" as a multidimensional process leading to the complication of political interactions and not limited to institutional change, and "politics of development" as a system of management practices correlated with the public demand for security and social well-being. The current research agenda in this field in Russia aims to promote the analysis of the subjective dimension of politics, with a focus on identity studies and on evaluating intangible development resources.

AB The environmental movement in Russia has been a most institutionalized form of collective action. Originating from the Soviet period and gaining momentum in late 1980s, it survived the 1990s' dramatic transformations as well as the changes in political opportunity structure in the 2000-2010s. Extant scholarship on environmental activism in Russia has been largely focused on case- studies of regional mass-mobilization, such as environmental campaigns at Shiyes station in Archangelsk. The paper represents the first systematic study of cross- regional variance in environmental collective action in Russia. Drawing on three datasets, we trace the general evolution of environmental protests in the period from 2007 to 2021 and provide a typology of Russian regions. The latter allows us to classify Russian regions by intensity and sustainability of eco-mobilisation. We demonstrate that, despite narrowing opportunities, the intensity of environmental protests during the last decade has been on the rise. The typology allows us to describe the existing variance and suggest new questions on the nature and factors of environmental protest activity in Russian regions.

ID THERAPEUTIC CULTURE
AB This article is devoted to the emotional side of the '(psycho)therapeutic culture' that has emerged in the West as a result of the penetration of psychotherapeutic ideas into almost all spheres of society. This culture interprets life events, relationships, and social processes through the prism of psychology, and is now rapidly globalizing, claiming to be a moral regulator. Meanwhile, the scientific approach is often lost, taking forms far removed from professional psychology and adapted to mass culture. Sociologists have explored the reasons for the spread of the psychotherapeutic culture, pointing to its ambivalence and its relationship with late capitalism, especially neoliberalism. Some scholars see in it an ethical potential for liberation and the formation of an autonomous moral subject seeking new forms of solidarity based on an ethics of authenticity and self -care. Others take a critical approach, seeing the therapeutic culture as an emotional and ideological tool that favors elites and shapes a 'narcissistic' subject, morally insensitive, losing social ties, and easy to control. This paper is aimed to review approaches to the analysis of therapeutic culture and to consider its ambiguities that can produce ambiguous social consequences and undermine the integrative and creative potential of this culture in terms of highlighted emotional ideals or imperatives. The combination of the desire for rational management of emotions and the cult of authentic feelings is the main point of contradiction. This article analyzes other contradictions, such as between the desire for intense emotional communication and the desire for personal autonomy. The emotional- therapeutic logic is contradictory and therefore compatible with other ideologies accepted in different cultural contexts, including the Russian one. It is important to assess the influence of psychotherapeutic culture in different spheres of social life, especially social policy, where a contradictory emotional- therapeutic style may hinder the implementation of socio- political programs.

AB This research aims to explore the issues of learning and teaching online at Russian universities, including during the COVID-19 outbreak. With movement and contacts restricted, all full-time students and all educators had to master new technologies in a very short term, develop special course layouts for remote teaching mode, and cope with the motivational challenges. The methods include but are not limited to content analysis of media publications, domestic regulations, and local normative documents. The concepts of macro-social and group (particularistic) solidarity together with the methodological position of the interplay between solidarity, autonomy, and agency, constitute the original theoretical ground of the research. Comparing in-person, blended, and complete virtual learning modes during COVID-19, the study discusses teachers' work overload, students' acceptance of distant modes of education, and their solidarity when interacting with university administrations and governments. The paper provides a meta-analysis by exploring the impacts of digital transformation and the Covid-2019 outbreak on justice, transparency, agency, and solidarity at universities. The findings show challenges and ways of self-realization of students and teachers in complex socio-economic, psychological, and educational conditions and are of decisive importance for teachers who develop and conduct philosophical disciplines online. Showing systemic shortcomings of the regional educational system, the paper raises our awareness of how emergency situation, political and managerial measures interact with challenges and coping practices of educational and non-educational actors.

DE youth; special military operation; socialization of youth; global

AB The geopolitical situation in which Russia finds itself requires the mobilization of social capital. The younger generation plays an important role in this process. The development of the Russian state depends on the level of young people's resilience, their ability to act effectively in conditions of uncertainty and great challenges. A special military operation is a kind of a " litmus test" that allows assessing the younger generation's psychological stability. In this article, the author analyzes the social well-being of young Russians, assessing it as an indicator of resilience and ability to overcome stress. The article is based on the results of an empirical sociological study conducted in February 2023 in ten subjects of the Central Federal District of the Russian Federation, as well as on the territory of the Republic of Crimea. The study was conducted using an online questionnaire. The study sample is quota-based, stratified by gender. The sample size is 960 people, aged 18 to 29 years. The article concludes that a significant part of Russian youth is experiencing emotional decline and a high level of stress, closely related to the conduct of the special military operation. The high level of stress experienced has an impact on young people's life strategies and behavior. Under the influence of stress, a significant number of young people abandon long-term planning and building their life trajectory. This contributes to the reproduction of dysfunctional social practices (for example, in the field of demography) and also leads to a decrease in interest in long-term state and public projects. An important conclusion is the high level of migration sentiments of Russian youth: 53% of respondents declare their desire to stay in Russia, 47% of respondents either consider leaving the country or do not exclude such an option. According to the author, the dispositions of the younger generation in the conditions of the special military operation are not a manifestation of a civil position, but rather represent the simplest mechanism for coping with a difficult life situation. In this context, the conclusion is made about the low efficiency of socialization institutions in Russia, which are not able to form the competence of resilience and readiness to act in difficult circumstances in young people.

AB The article examines the evolution of the concept of economic sovereignty and the key areas of discussion on the aspects of economic sovereignty in a changing world. It is argued that, despite all the disputed points, sovereignty remains the pillar of modern politics. The main discussions on the issue of economic sovereignty revolve around the two key concepts, i. e., that of independence and control. For developing countries, independence means, first of all, regaining control over their own resources. Developed countries are preoccupied with the problem of controlling economic (and technological) processes and resources in the global arena. The concept of economic sovereignty is gaining weight both in research community and in practical politics. The big debate on the issue of economic sovereignty is still ahead.

AB The article explores the immigration and integration strategies of Denmark and Sweden while assessing their efficacy. The two countries, sharing historical, cultural, social and economic similarities, face a common challenge: the formation of ethnoreligious enclaves primarily inhabited by individuals with a Muslim background. Due to the recent Europe- an migrant crises, there has been a notable increase in the number of migrants, leading to stricter integration policies in the Scandinavian countries. Yet, governmental approaches to address the segregation of immigrant areas vary between Denmark and Sweden. Denmark has adopted a stringent immigration policy promoting cultural assimilation of immigrants from non -Western countries, whilst Sweden follows a liberal approach advocating cultural and ethnic diversity within society. The evolution of immigration and integration initiatives in Denmark and Sweden has been reconstructed through the anal- ysis of official documents and critical examination of political discourses. It is noted that Swedish authorities are increasingly incorporating Denmark's more radical approaches to address migration issues within their political programmes. Despite the results of Den- mark's anti -immigration policies and the reduction in the number of segregated immi- grant areas, a myriad of issues persist due to EU immigration policies. The problem of forging a new civic identity rooted in the linguistic, religious and cultural homogeneity of Danish society amidst its multiculturalism remains relevant. Thus, Sweden is formulating its own anti -segregation programme, taking into account both the successes and shortcomings of Danish immigration and integration policies. Another important conclusion is that these nations have started to pay special attention to ethnic and religious criteria when identifying 'parallel societies'.

AB Since the mid-2010s, Germany has significantly adjusted its approaches to the use of the Bundeswehr, pivoting its strategic focus from regions distant from the Euro-Atlantic community to those within or near it. This has underscored the pressing need to address issues related to securing steadfast allies in Eastern Europe and enhancing cooperation with them. This article aims to explore the current evolution of German-Lithuanian relations in both political and military domains. The approach of Germany to the factor of historical memory is demonstrated, along with its aspiration to position itself as the defender of Lithuanian national sovereignty. Yet, there was a notable lack of strategic focus from Germany towards Lithuania in the early 21st century, contributing to a decline in bilateral relations in 2014 and 2015. Amid the confrontation between the 'Western democracies' and Russia, Germany adopted a strategy of gradually but steadily increasing pressure on the opponent. The perception of this approach by Lithuanian elites has shifted from negative in the mid-2010s to increasingly positive as Germany has become more involved in deterrence of Russia. This article explores the process of the Bundeswehr troops' deployment and buildup up to having constituted the 'core' of a multinational brigade in Lithuania under NATO's mandate. The study focuses on the impact of military cooperation on political collaborations, as illustrated by the case of the B3 + 1 format, which has brought together high-ranking public officials from the three Baltic states and Germany since 2018. It is concluded that Germany has developed a dependence on Lithuania, driven by the increased desire of the former state to maintain the latter as a reliable junior partner.

AB This study explores the stages of interaction in the 15th-16th centuries between two Turkic post-Golden Horde states: the Siberian Khanate and the Kazakh Khanate. The role of the Kazakh factor in the ethnic history of the Siberian Tatars is examined. Primary sources such as chronicles, charters, treaties, and other published documents are utilized for analysis. It is demonstrated that the common tribal composition of these states is linked to the maintenance of close relations between their polities and institutional mechanisms inherited from the previous Golden Horde period. However, the formation of political entities (the Kazakh and Siberian Khanates) in the mid to late 15th century initiated processes leading to the emergence of distinct ethnic communities (Kazakhs and Siberian Tatars) within these states. The traditional belief in historical literature that Kuchum was a 'Kazakh prince' is challenged. The author disputes the position of Kazakh colleagues regarding the significant role of the 'Kazakh' factor, including Sultan Urus-Muhammad, in the later period of the Siberian Khanate. The nature of Siberian-Kazakh relations in the 16th century was influenced not only by the interests of the khanates' rulers but also by external challenges posed by the emergence of new powerful political centers and leaders. The research's relevance stems from the limited exploration of the topic and conflicting approaches to the history of the formation of the Siberian Khanate and the ethnic community of Siberian Tatars in modern historiography.

AB This article is devoted to the reconstruction of the civil status and social practices of WWI prisoners of war who remained permanently in Russia/Soviet Union and ended up in Kazakhstan. Chronologically, the study covers the period from 1914 to 1939. Based on the materials of archival and investigative cases of former prisoners of war who became victims of mass repressions during the Great Terror, aspects of migration and social mobility, including repatriation, naturalization, civil status, and the status of foreigners, and discriminatory and repressive policies are considered. It is concluded that the dynamics of the status and the diversity of adaptation practices of former prisoners of war were determined by a number of external and internal political factors. For former prisoners of war, captivity became not only a trauma but also a social marker that secured their status as "former," which ultimately made them marginals in Soviet society.

TI The Strategy of the Biden Administration Towards European NATO Allies
SO CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA

DE Euro-Atlantic Space; Administration of J. Biden; strategic priorities in
   the field of foreign policy; problem of military-political autonomy
AB US relations with NATO allies are the key aspect of American foreign policy. At the present stage, the United States has a combined potential that exceeds the capabilities of other major international actors and the ability to project its influence in almost all regions of the world. The mechanism for shaping US foreign policy has been significantly affected by the contradictions caused by the activities of the D. Trump administration, which views on key foreign policy issues differed markedly from the position of most of the American political establishment. The concerns of US allies about the effectiveness of American security guarantees in these conditions have become a noticeable factor affecting relations within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, strengthening the sentiments of some European elites in favor of greater military and political autonomy. The victory of J. Biden was viewed as a return of American foreign policy to the traditional course, which presupposes the consolidation of NATO on the basis of key liberal principles and values. The purpose of this article is to study the key aspects of J. Biden administration's attitude towards European allies. This problem seems to be significant from the point of view of understanding the logic of the international behavior of the collective West, as well as the specifics of the activities of key institutions that ensure its international political influence, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Based on the application of a systematic approach, the use of general scientific and special methods, including the historical and political science method, as well as methods of comparative and formal logical analysis, the article solves research problems related to the analysis of the main policy directions of J. Biden administration's attitude towards European NATO allies. According to the results of the study, the strategy of the current US leadership in this direction is based mainly on the neoliberal ideological values. At the same time, it retains certain elements of continuity with D. Trump's policy, related to the US desire to redistribute costs within the bloc, shifting a significant part of the financial burden to the European members of NATO.

TI The Media Concept "Vaccination" in the Discourse of Non-State German
   Media during the COVID-19 Pandemic
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

DT Article
DE media concept; collocations; vaccination; pandemic; media; Germany
AB The relevance of the research is justified by the influence of the media on the consciousness and behavior of people during the crisis, allowing to form discursive phenomena that have specific characteristics. In addition, it seems particularly relevant to use linguistic tools to describe media and political phenomena, as well as to apply media and political theories to describe cognitive phenomena. This paper examines the ideological intertextual media concept of "vaccination" as a biopolitical tool, objectified in the discourse of non-state German media. The research material constituted the texts of "Suddeutsche Zeitung", "Die Zeit", "Die Tageszeitung" published between January 2020-March 2022 with a total volume of 23.38 million words. The methodological basis of the study was M. Foucault's (2010) understanding of "biopolitics", the propaganda model of E. Herman, N. Chomsky (2002), the provisions of culturomics (Bonch-Osmolovskaya, 2015) and the theory of cognitive-discursive world modeling (Kushneruk, 2018). To identify and analyze collocations, the tools of the Digital Dictionary of the German Language (DWDS), Sketch Engine, AntConc, and the NLTK library (Python) were used. At the first stage of the study, a lexicographic analysis of the definitions and collocates of the lexemes Impfung, Impfstoff and impfen was carried out using DWDS material. Next, collocations extracted from a random corpus of institutional discourse in Sketch Engine were analyzed. Finally, a cognitive-discourse analysis was carried out and the main cognitive features of the media concept "vaccination" were identified based on texts of German media. The media concept of "vaccination" as a biopolitical tool is a safe and effective means of protection against the virus. This conclusion is consistent with the cognitive features identified during the analysis of institutional discourse, as well as the everyday worldview. Thus, in the minds of native speakers, through the media, a positive attitude towards the state biopolitical program is formed, which also allows us to conclude that there is an ideological component in the constructed concept, namely, media support for the state's biopolitics.

AB Acculturation as a process of mutual influence of cultures, the perception by one people of all or part of the culture of another people needs further study. It is especially interesting to study the 18th century, when the Kalmyks had to change their territorial, national and surrounding ethnic environment at times. The Kalmyks, having started to become part of Russia, inevitably had to begin the gradual perception of Russian culture in all its manifestations: economic, political, social, cultural and everyday life. This perception was generally spontaneous, caused by the specific historical and political situation. The process of Kalmyk acculturation was slow, especially in the seventeenth century, so one may wonder whether there was acculturation in this period. If we answer in the affirmative, we can say that it was most of all through negative experience. The aim of the article is to show that acculturation was, and it is the same age as in the XVIII century. Comparative, systemic and functional methods were used in analysing and interpreting the material. Although the Kalmyks began to enter into some relations with the Russian population from the beginning of the XVII century, and the mentioning of them in Russian archival documents dates back even to the last third of the XVI century, the actual, physical, if we can put it this way, contact between the Russian and Kalmyk peoples falls on the XVIII century.

SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-PRAVO-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF LAW
LA Russian
DT Article
DE constitutional values; values of law; teleological interpretation of
   legal norms; norms and values
AB The use of different arguments and grounds for interpreting legal norms can be considered in relation to the text of legal documents within the framework of three approaches. Textualism limits interpretation to the literal content of the text itself. Meta-textualism relies on the general context of the textual fixation of the norm - the history of its adoption and law enforcement interpretation, systemic interrelations with other norms, the implied goals of legal regulation, etc. The meta-textualism is based on the general context of the textual fixation of the norm. Extra-textualism is based on the assessment of economic, political and other social consequences of the implementation of the norm. The latter is perceived in legal theory as a threat to the autonomy and purity of law, a threat to its certainty, sacrificed to political or other immediate interests. The author questions the place of value analysis in these three approaches, asking, in response to the criticism of value jurisprudence in the academic literature, whether such value analysis threatens the autonomy of law in favour of subjective and arbitrary grounds for decision-making. Despite the distinction traditionally made in science be-tween norms and values, there is a clear relationship between them. If the formal basis of legal norms is the authority to give them legal force, and lower-level norms must comply with more general legal prescriptions, the social content of legal norms is not explained in the formal plane. Meanwhile, any norm is oriented to a certain social result, which is the purpose of its adoption, and its content is best described through the indi-cation of the value, the realisation and protection of which the norm is aimed at. The involvement of value analysis in the mechanism of norm interpretation shows the con-sequences of choosing between competing norms or selecting a particular option of norm interpretation. The advantages and merits of the value-based approach can be fully developed under the conditions of an explicit declaration of those values that are realised in a particular decision of the legislator or the court. This declaration can create the value certainty that is required by the nature and basic principles of law. In addition, value analysis requires the dogmatisation of values, i.e. the disclosure of their content and mechanisms of realisation in legal norms, which, in particular, should provide an answer to the question of which values are incompatible with the basic principles of law and cannot be realised in legal norms. This answer should neither excessively nar-row nor unjustifiably expand the limits of the value content of law, preserving its socio-cultural universality, but protecting the fundamental values of law itself.

AB In the autumn of 1920, the 3rd Russian Army (3rd RA) was formed in Poland from former servicemen of other White armies and captured Red Army soldiers. Formally, it was subordinate to the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army Pyotr N.Wrangel, but in fact it was dependent on the Russian Political Committee in Warsaw (RPC) headed by Boris V. Savinkov. Initially, Russian units were to be used on the Polish front, but by the time the Soviet-Polish preliminary peace was signed in October 1920,they had not yet been fully formed, so Wrangel's representative in Poland, General Pyotr S. Makhrov, was faced with the question of what to do: either intern the army or withdraw it to the territory controlled by the Petliurists (army of the Ukrainian People's Republic). The commander of the 3rd RA General Boris S. Permikin, acting on behalf of the RPC (but not on Wrangel's behalf), reached an agreement with the Ukrainian commander General Mikhail V. Omelianovych-Pavlenko, and the 3rd Army was transferred to the Proskurov area, where it continued to form in the rear of Petliura's troops. In November 1920, the 3rd RA, together with the Petliurists, attempted to repel the offensive of the Red Army, but, having suffered serious losses, was forced to retreat across the Zbruch River to Galicia to be interned there. In many ways, the army was saved thanks to the activities of its Chief of Staff, Colonel Boris P. Polyakov, who was initially opposed to cooperation with the Petlurists forces. Based on materials from a number of archives and memoirs of participants, the author reconstructs the history of the "Ukrainian campaign" of the 3rd RA, showing its relationship with Petliura's units and the peasant population of Volhynia and Podolia.

   Future"; literature of Russian emigration; dissidents
AB The article examines the history of the ideological confrontation between Alexander Zinoviev (1922-2006) and Alexander Solzhenitsyn (1918-2008) - two of the most significant figures in the socio-political and literary processes of the second half of the 20th century. Their works and personal behavior became an important stage in the development of both national self-awareness and in the understanding of the Soviet social experiment by Western analysts. Contemporaries perceived their literary and journalistic activities in a dialectical relationship. The differences in the artistic strategies and historiosophical concepts of A. Zinoviev and A. Solzhenitsyn have been the subject of intense reflection by Russian and Western European intellectuals for several decades. As a result, a certain stereotype has emerged that simplistically interprets the ideological relationships of writers as mutually exclusive. At the same time, they are more complex and ambiguous. The article, based on an analysis of literary material, publicistic speeches, interviews and critical articles published in periodicals of the Russian diaspora, in newspapers and magazines of France, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and elsewhere in the 1970s and 1980s, reconstructs the true picture of relations. Most of the materials are introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. A. Zinoviev did not share the historiosophical and socio-political concept of A. Solzhenitsyn; he had his own understanding of the nature and character of Soviet society, based on the principles of logical analysis, which he called "real communism." At the same time, Zinoviev deeply sympathized with the pathos of moral transformation that permeated Solzhenitsyn's work. Zinoviev's polemical position towards Solzhenitsyn's views was reflected in the novel "Yawning Heights" (1976), on the pages of which a character named Pravdets (Truthteller) appears, based on Solzhenitsyn's socio-political activities. Zinoviev continued his polemic with Solzhenitsyn in the pages of the novel "The Radiant Future" (1978). Zinoviev and Solzhenitsyn never met in person. Solzhenitsyn, being familiar with Zinoviev's works and views, practically did not speak publicly about him, but he perceived them negatively. Solzhenitsyn's long silence was partly due to the fact that during these years he was focused on working on the novels from "The Red Wheel" cycle. He expressed his position in 1982 in the article "Our Pluralists", in which he responded to all his opponents at once (including Zinoviev). The article outlined the irreconcilability of Solzhenitsyn's position and the personal rejection of his ideological opponents. In view of these circumstances, Zinoviev temporarily ceased his polemics with Solzhenitsyn, which would resume under the new conditions of the 1990s. The history of the relationship between Zinoviev and Solzhenitsyn in the 1960s-1980s is a vivid example of the intensive search for paths of historical development of Russia in the circle of the civic-minded Russian intelligentsia of the second half of the 20th century.

DE progressive realism; foreign policy; UK; UK-Russia relations; US; EU;
   Ukraine; China; goals; methods; Global South; changes
AB The article explores the contours of the UK foreign policy of the Labour government of K. Starmer in the context of persistent strategic dilemmas. Through the use of the theory of change, the author's analysis of the new Cabinet's foreign policy focuses on its attempts to refurbish the ideology behind the international course, driven by the goals of change and the departure from the Tory legacy. At the same time, external stimuli (fragmentation and newly emerged centers), domestic political factors (the political legacy of the Brexiteers, inter-party consensus on key areas of foreign policy, public opinion), as well as previous foreign policy goals leave Labour little room for maneuver and a qualitative change of course. In foreign policy planning, the new government, on the one hand, draws upon the practical developments of its Tory opponents in the spirit of neoliberalism. On the other hand, it maneuvers between the realism and idealism of previous Labour governments. The novelty introduced by the Labour Cabinet has been "progressive realism". Central to this approach is shifting of emphasis in relation to Europe and trade, economic and military-political rapprochement with Brussels, as well as strengthening ties with the countries of the Global South while dropping the Global Britain rhetoric. NATO-first as a basic parameter of foreign policy stays put and dictates the logic of relations with the main centers of power in the Washington-Brussels-Beijing triangle, which corresponds to the approach of previous Conservative governments. At the same time, London promotes itself as a responsible player, keen on distancing itself from postcolonial practices. The article looks in detail at the first steps of the incumbent Cabinet in the foreign policy arena in the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific directions. London's attempts to build an image of a responsible player that distances itself from postcolonial practices and is guided by human rights and "moral leadership', do not fundamentally change London's foreign policy line. The uncompromising position on Ukraine against the backdrop of dependence on the "US factor" confirms the contradictory nature of the new concept, which may be adjusted with the arrival of a new White House administration.

DE immigration; electoral participation; third-country nationals;
   non-citizens; immigrant integration policy; voting rights; European
   Union
AB The article focuses on the analysis of the inclusion of third-country nationals in the electoral systems of European states from the perspective of immigrant integration policies. Until recently, participation in the electoral process was a stable attribute of national citizenship and was not extended to foreigners, and the only option for their inclusion in the political community remained naturalization. The situation began to change in the second half of the 20th century, when a number of European countries expanded the possibility of institutional participation, first to citizens from other states within the European Union and then to third-country nationals. At the same time, in European political discourse, the rationality of giving voting rights to the latter continues to be a debated and politicised issue, owing to social fears related to the cultural and religious affiliation of immigrants. The aim of the study is to assess the degree of electoral inclusion in European states. To achieve this goal, a theoretical and methodological apparatus has been formulated based on theories of immigrant integration and political participation, concepts of post-nationalism, post-migration, and citizenship, as well as works devoted to the electoral participation of foreigners and their inclusion in the electoral systems of recipient societies. The regulatory and institutional conditions for access of third-country nationals to the electoral systems of EU countries were examined, and types of electoral inclusion were identified. The main conclusion of the work is that, at the same time as the possibilities of electoral participation of third- country nationals are increased, the European States are establishing additional mechanisms of implicit exclusion, which, in the context of xenophobia, discrimination, and insufficient knowledge of the language of the country of residence, adversely affect their electoral activity.

AB The phenomenon of information and psychological confrontation with its components have been in the focus of attention of local and foreign researchers since the middle of the 20th century. As technology develops, the information front is becoming increasingly important: superiority over the enemy in the information and psychological sphere in modern conflicts is sometimes more significant than superiority on the battlefield. Currently, given global tensions, there is yet another aggravation in information confrontation in the Arab world, involving both Western and Eastern countries, including Russia. The current configuration of the conflict is significantly different from all previous ones: the bloc nature of cooperation between countries is gone (as was the case during the Cold War), while advances in information and communication technologies have allowed each side of the conflict to make an info-psychological impact on all countries in the region at once. To build a more effective national information policy, it is necessary to study in detail the approaches of other countries, determine the main and secondary vectors in their work, and identify the mechanisms of information and psychological impact. An analysis of the info-psychological strategies of the leading Western states (USA, Great Britain, and France) showed there was no unified approach to the implementation of activities in the information field at the theoretical and practical levels. The current state of disunity between the countries under consideration, with the leading role of the United States as the leader of the collective West maintained, is caused by both historical prerequisites and objective political and economic reasons. In the current situation and given the efforts to counter Western propaganda by Russia, China, and Iran, the information and psychological campaigns by the United States, Great Britain, and France are less effective than before, which nevertheless does not mean they have totally collapsed.

AB For the first time in scientific historiography, with the involvement of previously unknown archival documents that are stored in the GARF and RGIA, the process of preparing a Meeting chaired by Nicholas II on the revision of Fundamental Laws (April 1906) is considered. The course of the Meeting and its results were greatly influenced by the circumstances of the formation of the Meeting and its composition. The author analyzes the bureaucratic practices inherent in the process of preparing the Meeting. The initiation of the Meeting and the appointment of its members are being studied, which Nicholas II and the S.Y. Witte, were directly involved in. Special attention is paid to the implementation of the function of control over the preparation of the Meeting, which was the competence not only of the tsar and the Prime Minister, but also of P.A. Kharitonov, who was in charge of the office work of the Meeting. The mechanisms of both information support for the activities of the Meeting and business communication between its members and Kharitonov are being investigated. The article considers the political differentiation that manifested itself among the members of the Meeting already at the stage of its preparation, including due to the ideological heterogeneity of the materials that were provided to the monarch and royal dignitaries. It is concluded that the formation and composition of the Meeting testifies to the high level of political culture of the bureaucratic elite of the Russian Empire at the beginning of the XX century.

   "Kubanskaya Shkola," B.M. Gorodetsky; T.F. Lapik
AB The analysis of the publishing and thematic model of the pedagogical journal "Kubanskaya Shkola," published in the capital of the Kuban region from 1914 to 1918, demonstrated the dynamics of the transformation of this publication in relation to the political events occurring in the country during this period. Local history topics, declared as one of the priorities in the informational and thematic agenda of "Kubanskaya Shkola" by its first editor B.M. Gorodetsky, were maintained until 1916, after which there was a gradual shift in content towards addressing the urgent problems of Kuban teachers and a general radicalization of the content. In this context, an attempt has been made to reconstruct the pedagogical and creative biography of T.F. Lapik, whom B.M. Gorodetsky invited to the position of editorial secretary of "Kubanskaya Shkola" and who became one of the main authors of this journal. The use of archival materials and the historical-biographical research method enabled the reconstruction of T.F. Lapik's teaching career stages from the rural two-class school in the village of Besskorbnaya, Labinsky District of the Kuban region, where he held the position of "teacher-manager" and singing teacher, to the "preparatory class teacher" at the Kuban Alexandrovsky Real School, where he would rise to the rank of titular counselor. The article shows that moving to Ekaterinodar and obtaining a position at the Kuban Alexandrovsky Real School enabled T.F. Lapik to enter the journalistic community and take a significant position in the cultural space of the region. Content analysis of T.F. Lapik's main publications in "Kubanskaya Shkola" allowed for the determination of the thematic range of his texts, from articles with detailed local history content, including the notable article "Literary Readings-Discussions for Muslim Students," to his critical review of P.P. Orlov's anthology "Collection of Materials for the Cossack Reader of the Kuban Cossack Army." One of the significant aspects of studying T.F. Lapik's creative heritage in the present article is the analysis of his "local history arithmetic workbook," published in 1916, which elicited mixed reactions in both local and metropolitan specialized press. The latest findings in the State Archive of the Krasnodar Territory, reflected in this article, have allowed the introduction of previously unknown ego-documents related to T.F. Lapik, establishing the date and causes of his death, which are somehow correlated with the complex set of problems caused by the Civil War in the Kuban. The significance of T.F. Lapik's creative heritage was confirmed by a posthumous characterization by the leading specialist in culture, literature, and journalism of the North Caucasus, B. M. Gorodetsky. One can conclude that the combined methodological discourse applied in such subject areas as local and personal history, as well as regional media studies, offers a broad spectrum for further study of the personal element in the history of a particular region.

AB This article explores the factors contributing to the erosion of the EU social model and the underlying causes of the inefficacy of the Union's social policy. As the EU has to redefine its social priorities, the study analyses recent European Commission initiatives and proposals through the lens of sustainability and the evolution of the EU social model. The research is rooted in the concept of socio-economic models in Europe and employs a critical analysis of socio-political approaches to evaluate the Union's social efforts. Key supranational factors driving the erosion of the EU social model are identified, including the atomisation of the EU's social strategy, the compounded impact of successive crises, and the implications of the Ukrainian crisis. Special attention is given to the priorities of the current European Commission, led by Ursula von der Leyen, and their influence on fostering a unified social policy approach among member states. The analysis also considers national factors, such as the diminishing effectiveness of national and regional social models due to integration pressures and adaptation to the post-industrial economy. Additionally, discrepancies between the attributes of these models and actual citizen well-being, as well as transnational social challenges, are highlighted. Two overarching trends in the social policies of the EU and its member states are examined: the increasing precarity of modern work and lifestyles, and the evolving role and significance of the family, which has driven the expansion of child-centered social policies. The article concludes that a misalignment between the EU's social policy priorities and the practical possibilities of unification fosters citizen dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the interplay between crisis dynamics and the emphasis on green and digital transitions will likely result in a dual approach: promoting austerity to sustain economic competitiveness while supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors linked to green and digital technologies. Given that social policy is a cornerstone of the EU's image among its citizens and external stakeholders, the erosion of the European social model risks undermining the Union's reputation as a guarantor of high social standards and resident well-being.

LA English
DT Article
DE conflict field; Abkhazia; Russia; Georgia; frontier; nationalism;
   identity; South Caucasus; self-determination
AB Since the Soviet Union disintegration, the South Caucasus has become one of volatile parts in Eurasia. Although now it has found itself in the shadow of Ukraine, the events of 2020-2023 in Nagorno- Karabakh attracted political as well scholarly attention to this region. Today we observe the shaping of the new South Caucasus regional order, when some familiar alliances are experiencing crises, while others, on the contrary, are significantly strengthening. Against this background, the situation in Abkhazia looks, at first glance, static. However, it cannot be treated as a breakthrough in the conflict resolution. Until now, this partly recognized entity represents a set of contradictions and collisions. While the Georgian influence is not so serious, the growing impact of the Russian economic and military assistance has established a dilemma between the national selfdetermination and deepening integration with Russia. This situation of apparent stability opens up a good opportunity to study the conflict dynamics in Abkhazia through the prism of new approaches. The Abkhazian case is well-studied in the schorarly literature and therefore discovery of new research niches is a difficult task to implement. At the same time, the vast majority of scientific works are distributed across various disciplinary areas (history, ethnology and ethnopolitical science, international relations and international law) or focus on narrow chronological periods. Hence the formation of a research phenomenon, defined as the predominance of "detailing" over the "system", empirics over generalizations and synthesis. This article proposes a new approach to considering the genesis and dynamics of conflicts in Abkhazia. In accordance with the theoretical approaches of P. Bourdieu, the author examines the Abkhaz case as a conflict field. It is studied as interaction, competition, and confrontation among various players from the mid-19th to the first quarter of the 21st centuries.

DE Russia-NATO relations; militarization of Europe; arms limitation and

   Military Operation (SMO) of Russia
AB From the first steps of implementing the policy of NATO expansion to the East - since the first half of the 1990s, official representatives of the alliance have constantly emphasized that these actions would not pose a threat to Russia. Moscow held the exact opposite opinion, but its concerns and objections were not taken into consideration. As military and political relations worsened and disagreements between Russia and the West/NATO grew, the military potential of the alliance was increasingly strengthened, coming close to the Russian borders. Traditionally neutral states - Finland and Sweden - also joined NATO. The beginning of the Special Military Operation (SMO) was used by Brussels as a long-term pretext for the beginning of the active militarization of Europe, the implementation of plans for even a larger- scale strengthening of the military and political structure of the Alliance. The leadership of the USA and NATO, having taken a course for escalation, however, show a certain "restraint", trying to avoid a direct conflict with Russia. Brussels has repeatedly argued that NATO is not a party to the conflict in Ukraine and has set itself the task of preventing a direct clash Moscow has also repeatedly stated that it is not going to attack NATO countries. The United States and other Western states all the while do not allow Kyiv to use their weapons for strikes deep into Russian territory. Russia, on the other hand, is not completely destroying relations with the Alliance, as evidenced by the fact that Moscow is not going to withdraw from the 1997 Russia-NATO Founding Act. The article examines the current stage of relations between Russia and NATO, revealing its main features. The authors also provide a comprehensive examination of the content and nature of the new wave of militarization in Europe, using key European countries as examples.

AB The article explores the political processes of recent years in several Scandinavian countries. The author shows how, following the rise of the right-wing radical and nationalist movement and the weakening of centrist forces, left-wing political parties reemerged. The main focus is on the left segment of the political spectrum in Finland (and partly in Sweden). During the elections to the European Parliament the consolidated Left, for the first time after a long break, achieved impressive results. Using various sources and taking into consideration economic, social, political, ideological context of the emerging Left the turn in Finnish life is considered. It is revealed how the new alignment of political forces in Finland has created a situation where the center-right parties are increasingly yielding to the pressure of nationalists, and the main factor in opposing the further shift to the Right of the entire Finnish state machine is the Left. It is also demonstrated that socio-political contradictions are growing as long as the economic situation worsens and the current authorities' cuts budget allocations for social needs and introduces restrictive measures that directly affect the interests of significant masses of the working population. Although the previous block system, which allowed tactical cooperation has ceased, a new one has not yet been created.

   imagology; Svenska Dagbladet; Carl Bildt; "Russian menace"
AB The paper deals with the USSR and early post-Soviet Russia image evolution in the Swedish right-wing journalism between 1988 and 1993. In order to achieve the goal, the author analyzed the relevant materials published in the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper, which is affiliated with the Moderate-Coalition party of Sweden (Moderaterna), the main conservative party of the country in the chosen period. 145 main articles devoted to disintegration processes in the USSR and post-Soviet statehood emergence in Russia and published in Svenska Dagbladet between early 1988 and late 1993 became a subject to study.Methodology of the research is put into frames of historical imagology since the image of "another" is a subject to study. It refers to ethnostereotypes, which are tightly connected with political experience. The author came to conclusion, that perception of the USSR disintegration and early Post-Soviet Russian political and social reality has been containing both traditional elements of a Russian "another" and the new ones. The Swedish right-wing politicians demonstrated an ambivalent image of Russia, "Russians" and the USSR via Svenska Dagbladet newspaper. Positive features of the image referred to scale of the Russian market and prospective investment plans towards it. Here the Swedish right-wing journalists supposed that Sweden is to "lead" Russia during the market economy establishment. In addition to it, according to the Swedish historians cooperating with Svenska Dagbladet, Russia appeared to be a part of de Gaulle's "Europe from the Atlantic to Urals", and one of the major world culture contributors. Besides, preservation of the traditional values in Russian society got the Swedish right-wing discourse's attention. hese features were a subject to opposition in Swedish public opinion towards the Russian political culture and political system. Russia appeared to be an empire, and the post-Soviet Boris Yeltsin administration failed to abandon the imperial mentality. Also, Russia remained to be a competitor in the Baltic region, and Svenska Dagbladet columnists have mobilized the historical narratives on Swedish-Russian relations to prove it. Nonetheless they avoided sharp anti-Russian statements. The USSR disintegration appeared to be a subject to controversial perception: decentralization and struggle of the Soviet Republics (including Russia) against the Union authorities were welcomed alongside with a strong condemn to Stalinism and the CPSU. Oh the other hand, the main concern in Swedish right-wing discourse was the fate of Soviet nuclear arsenal. The processes between 1991 and 1993 were presented as "death of the Empire", "Raw capitalism", criminalization and chaos. The autocratic behaviour of Yeltsin was seen as a containment mechanism against anti-Yeltsinist State Duma. So the Swedish right-wing discourse remained predominantly sceptic towards Russia with a limited optimism towards cooperation Swedish-Russian dialogue.

TI Stepping Out of Step: the Contemporary Leftist Trend in Latin America
SO CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Latin America; Chile; Peru; Colombia; Brazil; left; social development;
   political processes; ideology; electoral processes
AB This article attempts to analyse the leftist trend in the social development of Latin America in the 21st century. At the beginning of the century, this trend took place due to a combination of political, social, and economic factors. The current "pink wave" can be explained by the dissatisfaction of the middle class with the existing system and traditional elites, who are unable to solve the most important problems of society. The study identifies a key characteristic of socialist movements: the pursuit of equality, which is understood broadly and includes aspects of wealth, gender, and ethnicity. The article explains the reasons for the reproduction of leftist political culture and compares progressive governments from different generations. It highlights key differences among them, including their driving forces, relationships with the United States, regional integration processes, and ideological positions. A significant part of the article analyses the political situation in Chile, Peru, Colombia, and Brazil. In each country, progressive governments don't have control over legislative power, and implementing decisions requires agreements with the opposition. While leftist ideology remains an important direction in social thought, it is not a dominant trend among Latin Americans. Furthermore, it is highly likely that the next electoral cycle may strengthen the position of right-wing parties in the region.

TI "Paradise" and "Eastern Man": the identity of the Russian pilgrim
   through the prism of pilgrimage texts from the turn of the 19th and 20th
   centuries
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Holy Land; pilgrimage; Palestine; identity; Jerusalem
AB The research discusses interest in pilgrimage, identity and the Russian identity constructing problems through spatial, religious and cultural-linguistic projections. There are the researches that focus on the stereotypes role and the image of Jews in pilgrimage notes, emphasizing the dichotomy of "friend/foe" in the formation of the identity of Russian pilgrims. The research consists of some stages. The undirected content church texts analysis was used for researching texts. Indicator words were identified to describe the local populations and territories of Palestine, which were grouped into semantic models. It was found that the main categories for describing developing countries include overcrowding, pollution, ugly buildings, order and cleanliness, crowdedness, and danger. Ethnic groups are divided into blocs similar to the Ottoman system: Europeans, Muslims, Orthodox and Jews, each of whom fit traditional stereotypes. Reconstruction of models of representation of spaces and population demonstrates general stereotypes of perception characteristic of Russian Orthodox pilgrimage texts about the Holy Land. The research text focuses on Palestinian cities such as Jerusalem, Jaffa and Bethlehem, and describes pilgrim routes starting in Odessa and passing through Constantinople. An analysis of indicator words showed that the authors pay the greatest attention to urban pollution (28.9%), linking this with ethnic and religious events, for example, removing the dirt from the Jewish quarter in Jerusalem. There is focusing on the "ugliness" of local buildings and the poor attitude towards religious buildings. In contrast, the cleanliness of European settlements and positive reviews of the Mosque of Omar are noted. Other important aspects include the narrowness of streets (23.7%) and the dangers facing pilgrims (10.5%), which serve to compare Middle Eastern and European urban planning. The research identifies three main stereotypes of the Middle East perception: danger, uncleanliness and thirst for profit. The danger topic can be traced back to medieval texts, where travelers described threats from the local population. Although the safety of the pilgrimage was to be ensured by international treaties, political instability in the Ottoman Empire continued to pose a risk. Uncleanliness and pollution are also universal stereotypes that are often used to describe the Middle East, and can be linked to the cultural and symbolic structures of society, as conceptualized by anthropologist Mary Douglas. The pilgrim's reaction to the discrepancy between the expected image of the Holy Land and reality leads to the rejection of the local population as a "dirty" element. An example is the treatment of Muslims in Constantinople, who are perceived as alien compared to European standards.

AB The object of this study is the socio-cultural milieu of the Russian province (mainly Siberia) during the First World War, the revolutionary events of 1917 and the Civil War in Russia. The subject of the authors' consideration is the communicative space of G.N. Potanin (1835-1920), a famous scientist and public figure, formed through correspondence. The purpose of the study is to explore the information potential of Potanin's correspondence, which reveals the orientation and nature of his communications, personal and professional relationships, and the intellectual space in the formation of which he actively involved. The authors set themselves a number of tasks. First, to identify the specifics of the communicative space formed by the beginning of the 1917 Revolution around G.N. Potanin. Secondly, to clarify the composition and content of G.N. Potanin's correspondence of the period 1917-1920. Thirdly, to study the information potential of G.N. Potanin's correspondence for further study of the intellectual space of the Russian province at the end of the XIX - first quarter of the XX centuries. The source base of the research was correspondence (letters, postcards, telegrams, name cards) by G.N. Potanin, stored in his personal archive, which is located in the Research Library of Tomsk State University. Also, the sources are the published correspondence of G.N. Potanin, his journalism, periodicals and memoirs of contemporaries. The analysis of G.N. Potanin's correspondence allowed us to present the territorial coverage of his correspondent network. During the war, the revolution and the beginning of the collapse of the Russian Empire, it continued to cover almost the entire country. By 1919, the area had narrowed to the limits of Siberia. It was possible to determine the "density" of the information flow. G.N. Potanin received the largest number of letters in the spring of 1917 during the period of the rise of the revolution and the surge of political activity. An analysis of the circle of correspondents showed that most of them are representatives of the intellectuals. The authors associate the further prospects of the study with the identification in the texts of the messages of emotives, value judgments that determined the mindset, the interests and ideals of G.N. Potanin and his correspondents. This will require a machine analysis of the corpus of texts of G.N. Potanin's correspondence and his circle of communication in order to identify a particular topic, the frequency of its mention, to study the connections between different topics, as well as to investigate the contexts of their actualization.

AB The article analyzes the results of the elections to the European Parliament and their consequences for the future foreign policy of the EU towards Russia and Ukraine. The author considers the EU as one of the global centers of power, which position determines not only the development of the Ukrainian conflict, but also the future world order. From the point of view of Russian interests, it is very important to understand which party and political forces will influence decision-making in the European Union in the next five years. The author dwells in detail on the analysis of the alignment of political forces in the European Parliament after the 2024 elections, the role of right-wing parties, and their positions on the Ukrainian issue. It reveals the dilemma of the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and her basic principles in the choice of allies. Considerable attention is paid to the analysis of the EU's foreign policy strategy and an expert assessment of future relations with the United States. It considers ow the election of the US president on November 5, 2024 will affect the distribution of roles within the collective West, and what task, in this regard, the leader of the EU Germany sets for itself. The author studies the current papers of leading German think tanks, their forecasts, statements by the ruling elite of Germany, and representatives of the opposition. The article assesses the chances of the far- right Alternative for Germany and the left-wing Sarah Wagenknecht Union to influence federal policy.

   president; elections; Africa
AB The article examines the nationalization of voting in presidential elections in Sub- Saharan African countries in order to explain the emergence of national leaders with fairly homogeneous support of ethnic and regional groups of the electorate. The authors demonstrate the absence of a unidirectional process of nationalization, suggesting the continued fragility of African statehood under fundamental conditions of high ethno- linguistic fractionalization. Thestudy confirms thecrucial role of theincumbency effect, which strengthens support for acountry's leader when elected for anew term due to favorable institutional environment, but reveals other factors as well. One of them is theeconomic success of theincumbent, which contributes to thegrowing uniformity of his/her territorial support while economic failures have an opposite effect. Theincumbent's efficiency in ensuring public security and especially in forming elite coalitions across thedifferent areas of thestate might also be important. Given theinitial shortage of national leaders in African countries due to thenature of their statehood, these reasons while coming into play under fairly democratic conditions contribute to theartificial "construction" of national leadership, which can be quite successful although temporary. At thesame time, success of nationalization is more related to certain states (such as Ghana or Senegal) than to personalities, indicating that thestructural characteristics of political systems are more important than thepersonal characteristics of agents. However, when thefactors noted above do not work properly or pose threats to incumbents because of their failures, basic ethno-regional differences in Africa come back into full force.

AB Another presidential election ended in the United States in November. 2024 has become one of the most politically turbulent periods in recent US history. In a time of 3.5 weeks, the country has witnessed: a split of the Democratic party, J. Biden's refusal to participate in the elections only 3 months before the end of the race, an attempted murder of his opponent, first black woman nomination as a candidate for presidential race, her appointment bypassing primary elections i. e. the will of American electorate. In 2024, traditionalistic country, the United States, which is governed by 235-year-old Constitution, "violated" so many of its own rules, and created such long-term legal precedents that testify not only to the crisis of the US electoral system, but to transformations in its political systemin general. Their consequences will have an impact on the domestic policy of the country but also might raise the question of the United States' global leadership. Methodological basis of this article includes systemic, historical and comparative approaches. They allow reader to consider internal political processes in the United States as a result of interaction among state institutions and society, under the influence of external factors, at a certain historical period. Comparative analysis allows to evaluate the dynamics of changes among this system key elements: political parties, President, Congress, electorate, as well as to assess how, and in what period of American history, external factors such as electoral cycle, public opinion polls, social outbursts, state of economy, traditions etc. influenced this balance. The author evaluates long-term consequences of the precedent when Democratic party appointed its new favorite, bypassing the voters. Based on the historically identified features of the modern American electoral system, raises the question if the party's role in the electoral process has changed, or it is just a vision of changes. Finally, the author identifies possible areas for US electoral system reform.

In a randomized control trial comparing role models, cash incentives, and celebrity endorsements, only role models successfully mitigated vaccine reluctance and ameliorated pandemic- induced educational setbacks. Monthly tracking of vaccination status was achieved via QR- code- verified certificates. Theory- of- mind behavioral data on the mentalizing of others shed light on the mechanism underlying the role model effect. This research, from Pakistan, suggests how role models and theory of mind have the potential to play a role in tackling global challenges.

AB The article discusses how Russian youth search for resilience strategies, opportunities for decision-making and meaningful participation in times of uncertainty. Being in a high-risk political climate, young Russians turn to prefiguration: they embody the alternatives to the existing regime of neoliberal governmentality via organizing or engaging in grassroots activist initiatives. Based on the analysis of in-depth interviews with young St. Petersburg residents in 2022 and 2023, we show how they define their civil positions in the presence and how they mark their (non)adulthood. We demonstrate that involvement in prefiguration via informal grassroots youth organizations is an important condition for the formation of the youth's civic consciousness.

AB Throughout the period of post-colonial development of the countries of the Western Sahel, these polities have been facing a multitude of challenges in socioeconomic, environmental and political spheres, among which the rising scarcity of water and the corresponding degradation of agricultural lands and pastures has been gaining in prominence. The paper aims to analyse the causes and implications of a relatively new phenomenon for this region - the escalation of armed hostilities between herders and farmers, who until a few decades ago coexisted peacefully, over access to arable lands, pastures and sources of water. In particular, the authors focus on the impact of the 'water problem', which lies at the nexus of water scarcity and misguided and discriminatory government policies, on the socio-political situation in the Western Sahel, and find that it has become a key factor of regional destabilisation, fuelling not only farmer-herder conflicts, but also Islamist insurgencies.

DE Notovich; railway concessions in Persia; Russian-English rivalry in
   Persia; Russia's access to warm seas
AB The author examines the struggle between the United Kingdom and Russia for the possession of railway concessions in Persia. On the Russian side, one of the participants was Nikolai Notovich. He opposed Russia's concessions to Britain and advocated for the intensification of Russian policy in this area. Over time, his views on the most profitable routes for the construction of railway tracks for Russia changed in accordance with the international situation, the balance of power between the main actors, and the 1907 Russian-British agreements on the division of Persia into spheres of influence. The latter led N. A. Notovich to the idea that under the new conditions it is no longer sensible to build a through road across Persia to the coast of the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean. Instead, he advised to focus on developing the railway network in the northern regions of the country, which would contribute to the growth of economic, political and cultural influence of Russia.

LA English
DT Article
DE Germany; European Union; economic Standort; space; crisis;
   Ordnungspolitik; competition
AB Germany's economic Standort, as a crucial component of the European Union's broader economic and political space, largely shapes its competitiveness. In his September 2024 report on this topic, Mario Draghi gave special, though understandibly insufficient, attention to Germany's role. This article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the competitive strengths and weaknesses of Germany's economy. The author employs a spatial approach, viewing the German economy as a Standort product, intentionally shaped by the executive and legislative authorities at all levels, in collaboration with key stakeholders from business, academia, education, and active segments of civil society. The author concludes that inefficiencies in the federal government's economic and political activities, including inadequate dialogue with stakeholders, along with structural problems accumulated over recent decades in the national economy, have been major contributors to the decline in Germany's competitiveness. Prospects for reversing this negative trend remain uncertain. Without stronger leadership in Berlin and more effective Standort collaboration, there is a risk that Germany in the medium term.may continue to be the << sick man of Europe >>.

DE European Union; Africa; migration; migration diplomacy; border
   management; readmission
AB The article offers a fresh insight into the relations between the European Union and Africa from " migration diplomacy" perspective which is being introduced in migration and international relations research in Russia. The author notes the explanatory and predictive potential of the " migration diplomacy" concept for considering the complex relations between states within different migration systems. The analysis of interactions and cooperation of the EU, as a receiving side, with the states of origin and transit of international migrants in Africa allowed to highlight the specifics of the EU approach. The latter consists in using various diplomatic means and formats to address the problem of illegal immigration and reducing the number of asylum seekers in the EU. The increasing dependence of the European Union on cooperation with third countries results in the use of migration as a tool of political pressure by partner states. Intracontinental migration processes are at the centre of the migration diplomacy of the African continent, including those related to freedom of movement. Despite the differences in the approaches of the parties, the potential for cooperation lies in the development of channels for legal labour migration.

AB The article presents an analysis of the development of the Czech labour market, taking into account demographic trends. The main long-term trends of decreasing unemployment, structural changes and maintaining their attraction for foreign actors are outlined. The negative consequences of the last two years have been assessed. A lack of certain specialists and high-qualified workers remains among the key problems of the Czech labour market which the government regulatory measures are aimed at. Changes in the financing of employment policy and transition to more effective support measures are shown. Special attention is paid to solving the ageing problem and to involving of older people on the labour market. The implemented methods of maintaining employment among this category of citizens are analysed. Operating instruments of attracting highly qualified and qualified workers in the Czech Republic, the base of which are the key programs, are considered. A selectivity of such measures, its flexibility and changing due to political reasons are shown. The role of labour migrants on the Czech labour market is shown using the example of Ukrainians. The Ukrainian labour force traditionally was engaged in low- skilled labour, mainly in construction and industry. The consequences of the influx of refugees because of the Ukrainian crisis, their current situation and consequences for the Czech labour market are analysed. Due to gender and age differences between refugees and typical labour mi grants from Ukraine there is no significant increase in the influence of Ukrainians on the Czech market. Problems of poverty, integration and employment corresponding to qualification remain. The key perspective of changes of the Czech labour market, including problems of shortage of certain categories of specialists, are designated.

AB The article deals with the problem of ontological security of T & uuml;rkiye and Serbia and its impact on the foreign policy of these states. The different historical paths of these states inevitably leave their imprint on the macro-political communities' vision of their history and, accordingly, on the arrangement of foreign policy priorities. In T & uuml;rkiye, " neo-Ottomanism " and the desire to regain leadership in the Islamic world are at odds with the ideological and institutional legacy of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Republic. Serbia, which current statehood is based on the foundations laid by Slobodan Milosevic, is forced to adapt the " Kosovo " founding myth to the contemporary geopolitical realities of the Southwest Balkans; the victim and defensive narratives construed to reduce ontological insecurity are already struggling to do so.

AB As a result of the technological revolution, there is a doubling of the reality in which modern man operates. Many resources, activities, public and private services are moving to a virtual environment. Along with the phenomena of the surrounding world that are familiar to people, their digital varieties arise, closely interacting with their real-life counterparts. The article is devoted to digital inequality and digital poverty, the evolution of approaches to their study in domestic and foreign academic literature. It is concluded that the theories explaining their existence organically complement each other, giving an idea of the necessary and sufficient conditions for full human participation in the life of a network society. The coverage of different segments of the population with new technologies was not uniform. Special attention is paid to the factors preventing vulnerable segments of the population within the European Union from taking full advantage of technological innovations and fully participating in society. The division of society into digitally engaged and outsiders is a big social and political problem that humanity will have to deal with in the 21st century.

AB The article is dedicated to the state of contemporary Russian area studies and their research field in the conditions of high demand for comprehensive and multifaceted approach. The author deliberates on the problem of new normality in connection with the phenomenon of partial deglobalisation. He analyses the interplay between the politics of geopolitisation of relations among leading powers and the institution of nation-state. Also, the topics of foreign interference, resilience and deep state are dwelt upon. Besides, the research looks into an issue of primary and secondary nature of the political and the economical in international relations. The significant part of the work covers the role of civilisations in area studies. The author supports the thesis that civilisational studies occupy a place between area and global studies. At the same time, he questions the validity of the application of civilisational approach to the daily politics in light of its ambivalences and numerous assumptions. Typologically, the notion of border, or multi-composite, civilisation is discussed. The article pays a significant attention to the discourse of juxtaposition of European and Russian civilisations and also raises the problems of conceptual substance of state-civilisation and criteria of historical development. The conclusion is drawn that civilisations' spaces will continue to be porous and changeable and exposed both to augmentation and fragmentation.

AB The work of the Spanish sociologist Luis Miller is devoted to the study of the phenomenon of polarisation typ ical of many countries of the modern world - the division of society into two confrontational, or even warring camps. The monograph examines the causes, nature, varieties, consequences of polarisation, possible ways to overcome its negative consequences. Based on the Spanish experience, the author compares it with the political practice of those countries where similar processes are developing. The monograph demonstrates that polarisation is based on the identification of a person with a particular social community, a certain political choice. In this case, there is a comparison with the Other, which becomes a catalyst in the formation of a common group identity. The Other becomes a catalyst in the formation of a common group identity. L. Miller identifies three types of polarisation - ideological, affective and everyday, giving a characteristic of each of them. Spain in the last decade has become one of the most polarised countries in the world. Among the main causes of polarisation, the author highlights the existence of persistent mass unemployment and deep social inequality, the unresolved territorial problem, expressed in the existence of a strong separatist movement in Catalonia. The transformation of the Spanish party system - the transition from bipartism to a real multi- party system - also played a role. The emergence, along with traditional new very influential parties, led to the formation of left and right political and ideological blocs, relations between which are characterised by a high degree of intolerance. The author sees the effective way to combat the negative consequences of polarisation in reducing the severity of economic and social problems generated by inequality and social exclusion.

AB The article was written on the eve of the US presidential election in 2024 and is devoted to the economic aspects of modern transatlantic relations. Descriptive statistics is used to assess the role and place of the transatlantic economy in terms of gross product, export-import operations, trade of US and EU branches and investment activity. The article touches upon the interconnectedness of the economy. It tense noted that the parties remain the main source of prosperity for each other. On this basis, hypotheses has been put forward about the reasons for restarting the dialog and its instability. Taking into account the logic of well-known integration theories, the author deliberates about the predisposition of the USA and the EU to institutionalize relations with the creation of common norms. However, small advantages on the US side in the ratio of benefits from economic integration are a factor of instability and an opportunity for further competition within the transatlantic economy. Based on the analysis of official reports on the activities of the US-EU Trade and Technology Council and other documents, the author's vision of the purpose of the dialogue is formulated - to test political innovations that contribute to completing the transition of the transatlantic economy to the sixth wave of innovation and maintaining its leadership positions in the world.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE identism; antiidentism; liberal democracy; traditionalism; parties and
   social and political movements; problems of indentity; Ukrainian crisis;
   cancel culture
AB The article analyzes the impact of the Ukrainian crisis on the ideological confrontation between identists and antiidentists (ultraliberals, supporters of "liberal democracy") in the world and the influence of crisis on the prospects of the further consolidation of identism. Identism is considered as the worldview of parties and movements that defend identity and traditions, family values, and criticize immigration to varying degrees and with different accents. It is emphasized that the appeal to identity is increasing in current political decisions and discussions. It raises the question of rethinking the "clash of civilizations" through the dynamics of universalism and particularism, referring to tradition and the protecting identity in the programs of political parties. The analysis of political conflicts and speeches by the leaders of parties and movements demonstrated that anti -Russian policy and the policy of "cancel culture" towards Russia have become a manifestation of aAnew round of confrontation between mainly Western antiidentism and an e merging global force - traditionalism or identism. Most politicians, public and cultural figures were faced with the dilemma of whether to make a choice in favor of Russia in order to dissociate themselves from antiidentism or to stay away. The logic of confrontation is based on the displacement (in the consistent and harsh application of cancel culture) of one's ideological opponent into a marginal field, if it is not possible to achieve his complete destruction as a social or political player. The Ukrainian crisis has made the confrontation between identitarians and antiidentitarians more pronounced at the international level and opponents of antiidentism have become part of the political space of most countries. The most important feature of the confrontation between the two ideological systems is the significant presence of supporters of various opposing parties in almost all countries and regions.

TI The Opportunistic Nature of Soviet Jewish Policy
SO RUDN JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE USSR; Jews in government; political repression; anti-cosmopolitan and
   anti-nationalist campaigns; anti-Semitism; xenophobia
AB The Jewish policy of the Soviet leadership was inconsistent, cautious, ambivalent, and it was based primarily on practical considerations and specific circumstances. Suspicious, distrustful or wary attitudes towards Jews on the part of non-Jews were widespread throughout the entire Soviet period. However, as a rule, this was not the result of official antisemitism, Russophobia or any ethnophobia in its pure form. Jews were discriminated against in the pre-war period, primarily due to the fierce struggle for political power at the top, and in the post-war period - due to the transition of a significant part of the Jewish diaspora into opposition to the Soviet regime and a continued desire to emigrate. Everyday anti-Semitism came into conflict with the philo-Semitic policies of the leadership; there was no consistency between the intensity of political repression and the extent of Jews' participation in government. In 1926-1935 (during the all-Union party-state campaign against anti-Semitism, aimed at protecting Jews), Jews were subjected to more repression than in 1948-1953 (during the all-Union party- state campaigns against cosmopolitans and nationalists, directed largely against Jews). At the same time, with the representation of Jews in power structures in 1920-1945 grew, and in 1948-1953 (the "dark years" of Soviet Jews), they remained statistically overrepresented in management and the elite. The author concludes that anti-Semitism was not a principle of Soviet national policy which was not fundamentally anti-Jewish but was fundamentally opportunistic; this policy did not exclude Jews from public life, or from the elite and management of society, but, on the contrary, it had the goal of effectively using the fruits of their human capital in the interests of the state.

AB In some countries, all subnational units have the "right of legislative initiative" the shared rule arrangements. However, despite equal opportunities within the try, regions demonstrate enormous differences in their legislative activity. Based calculation of the number of regional legislative initiatives for the period 2001-2020 Russia and some other European countries (Italy, Spain, Germany, and Switzerland), we examine the impact of the specificity of individual regions, which is a consequence of the territorial heterogeneity of the country, on their activity in national ing. Employing OLS regression analysis, we find that the distinctiveness of a terms of its geography, economy, and history generates special political interests positively influences their activity in national lawmaking both in Russia and European countries.

AB The article considers international activities of Bulgaria towards the Western Balkans states within the context of the EU further enlargement in 2018-2024. AThe author aims to evaluate the strategy of Sofia policies towards Bulgarian communities in Albania, Kosovo, Serbia and North Macedonia against the background of the internal political situation. Special attention is paid to the Presidential institution, which provides the continuity of the external policies in the situation of crisis of the political parties and parliamentarian system. Though the National Strategy towards Bulgarian citizens and Bulgarian historic communities over the world approved by the Bulgarian GovernmentAin 2014 was not further developed, the ongoing international activities of Sofia constitute a strategy of practical actions. In the bilateral relations with Albania, Kosovo and Serbia Sofia insists on constitutional guarantees of the Bulgarian historic communities' status and rights. The inclusion of Bulgarians in the list of national minorities in the Albanian legislation serves as argument in the negotiations with the other two states. In the bilateral relations with the Republic of North Macedonia Sofia puts forward the guidance of the good neighbor principles according to the treaty on friendship, good neighborhood and cooperation signed on August 1, 2017 aligning the constitutional recognition of the Bulgarian minority with history, language and identity issues considered by special bilateral multidisciplinary commission. The activities of Bulgaria are based on its strategic evaluation of the abovementioned states' perspectives, are being substantiated with the European legal norms, meet the support of the society and rely upon Brussel's understanding and support.

ID ELECTIONS
AB This paper focuses on political business cycles (PBC) in Russia's regions. It demonstrates that regional budget expenditures are conditional upon federal electoral cycles, with the most and least pronounced effects observed during presidential and subnational elections respectively. Since they became most discernible following the 2009 crisis, political business cycles have evolved until the recent presidential elections. As for regional authorities, they have primarily utilized the cycles by increasing expenditures on infrastructure rather than public sector spending, with education being the notable exception. Regression analysis indicates that infrastructure spending positively influences support for pro-regime candidates in presidential elections, while certain social expenditures benefit United Russia in regional legislative elections. This study highlights the role of PBC s in reinforcing performance-based legitimacy for the Russian regime.

It explains why there are several educational models of OAS at bachelor's and master's degree in Russia and describes the current situation where 22Russian universities offering OAS programmes produce graduates with mostly only two majors, i.e., historians and philologists. The article addresses the position of OAS among modemRussian scientific disciplines. Another aim is to trace the historical logic of the development of Oriental Studies and related African Studies in Russia, placing the discourse in the context of the Eastern Question, or the political fate of the Ottoman Empire. Finally, it identifies and justifies some current alternative trends in the development of OAS in Russian education and science.

AB Various political movements in Russia followed the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902 (also known as the South African War). The reasons why the Russian Marxists, who later carried out the first socialist revolution in history, sympathised with the Boers and ignored the reactionary and exploitative nature of their regimes in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State remained unexplored. Russian Marxists were reluctant to join the mass pro-Boer effort. However, they participated in the pro-Boer campaign conducted by the Second International. Poorly informed about the oppression of Africans in the two republics, the social democrats regarded the Boers as freedom fighters whose experience deserved to be studied and applied to the confrontation with tsarist autocracy. Russian Marxists used information on Boer commando tactics and other aspects of the South African War for instruction, training, and dissemination of their ideas. They campaigned for an introduction of a militia in Russia and studied the methods and organisation of Boer military units. Although Russian Marxists had little in common with members of burgher commandos, lessons of the Boer resistance to British imperialism served the cause of a Russian revolution.

AB The law of Duverger posits that the single-member plurality electoral system favours the two-party system. The empirical tests of Duvergerian effects often rely on the effective number of parties as the most common measure of party system fragmentation. This study, proceeding from the notion that more focused measures of two-partyness could be of greater utility for this purpose, examines the build-up of two already existing, albeit underused, indices that are intended to operationalize the concept of the two-party system and introduces a new family of party-system indices for the purpose of cross-validation. The quantitative analysis performed on simulated and real-life datasets shows that the measures of two-partyness can improve the methods of inquiry in research on Duvergerian effects, and that some of the indices introduced in this study can serve as useful supplements to the toolkit of political science.

Multiplication of copies of the original act from the moment of its adoption took place many times and often in significant editions. In order to assess the degree of uniqueness of the copy under study, such criteria as the time and place of its creation, prevalence and connection of the copy as an artifact with famous historical figures were used in the process of the study. The study of the archival document in accordance with the above criteria allowed us to identify the country of its origin (France), the printing house where it was printed (15 Quai Voltaire in Paris) and the artist who made the facsimile (F. Lepel). Reference to the activities of the partnership Kaeppelin & Cie, which owned the printing house, and the biography of the owner E.

According to the author of the article, it is most likely that the copy was sent by mail or courier to Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov (1782-1836), prince, governor-general of Novorossiysk province and governor of the Bessarabian region, but the possibility that his son Semyon Mikhailovich Vorontsov (1823-1882), who served in the Department of External Relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Empire, acquired the document is not excluded. Only one more copy of this circulation is known. The article concludes that this archival copy is valuable both because of its rarity and its connection to the history, political and cultural life of three countries - the United States, France and Russia. For the United States, this document is evidence of probably the first production in Europe of a known facsimile copy of the Declaration of Independence with the signatures of congressional participants. It shows the interest of Europeans in this normative act. For France, the significance of this document is connected, first of all, with the printing activities of the partnership Kaeppelin & Cie, which made a significant contribution both to the development of lithography and zinc printing in the country and to the distribution of artworks exhibited in various museums around the world and collectors' collections. For Russia, the copy of the archival document is another important evidence of the interest of such representatives of the Russian political elite as M. S. and S. M. Vorontsovs. M. S. and S. M. Vorontsovs' interest in the political life of the United States and its wide and varied cultural ties.

AB The brief history and the current status of the development of multilateral military, political, and economic initiatives of the United States in the Indian and Pacific oceans that aim to contain the expansion of China and its growing economic and military power are summarized. An attempt is made to analyze these initiatives and alliances as a system, even though they may seem at times counterintuitive, strategically heterogeneous, and chaotic.This paper also attempts to evaluate the opportunities for the United States and its allies in the region to strengthen these initiatives further in the context of a sharp rise of tensions between the United States and China in 2022 around the problem of Taiwan. This political clash instigated by Washington in summer of 2022 is often regarded as a potential threat of a military conflict, so it is important to estimate to what extent the US-formed mechanisms of political and defense cooperation in the region have potential to solve the purposes of the United States in case of a "hot" stage of the Taiwan crisis.

AB The article examines the priorities of China and the United States in the Indo-Pacific, examines the current trends of the US-Chinese strategic confrontation in the Indo-Pacific region, expressed, among other things, in the formation of new international institutions reflecting primarily the economic rivalry of regional leaders. The key features of the policy of the Chinese leadership led by Xi Jinping in the Pacific are highlighted. The course of the J. Biden administration's Pacific diplomacy is compared in detail with the Indo-Pacifist policies pursued by previous American governments in the twenty-first century. The official regional strategies of China, the United States and American allies are compared, and the multivariance of U.S. partnerships with Indo-Pacific countries is assessed. The balance of positive consequences and risks in the relations between the United States and China with the countries of the region is analyzed, as well as the readiness of the East Asian states to follow in the wake of American and Chinese diplomacy. In this context, the potential and prospects of the subjectivity of the countries of the region in the context of the American- Chinese rivalry, their possible role as a stabilizer of political and economic processes in the Indo-Pacific are investigated.

AB Published are documents from the investigative file of the Soviet scientist-microbiologist and epidemiologist Alexei Alexandrovich Zakharov, who was arrested in February 1938 and shot in October of the same year. The relatives, including the wife, the prominent Soviet microbiologist Zinaida Vissarionovna Ermolieva, were not informed about A. A. Zakharov's execution. They were informed that the scientist was given 10 years in camps without the right to correspondence. In this regard, Z. V. Ermolieva took all possible steps to revise the case. One of such attempts is presented in the publication - an appeal to the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the RSFSR I. T. Golyakov. This appeal contains a number of arguments demonstrating that the prosecution is based on falsifications, slander and intimidation of persons arrested in this case to give "necessary" testimony. Z.V. Ermolieva's letter was not a substitute for the lawyer's appeal, rather it was supposed to be a supplement to it. The scientist attached to her statement a number of characteristics about the personality of A. A. Zakharov and reviews of the importance of his scientific achievements. Among those who were not afraid to sign such characterizations and reviews were colleagues, famous writers, and acquaintances of the scientist, among whom were world-renowned researchers, such as one of the founders of microbiology, N. F. Gamaleya. Three such documents are cited in the publication, along with a statement by Z. V. Ermolieva. V. Ermolieva. The mentioned documents date from the period of 1938-1940. A. A. Zakharov (1895-1938) was a prominent Soviet scientist-microbiologist and epidemiologist, a pupil of V. A. Barykin. He made a significant contribution to the victory in the USSR over the epidemics of cholera, typhoid and typhus, Beck's disease, Transbaikal epidemic polyarthritis and a number of others. Among the charges brought by the investigation against him were: creation of a counterrevolutionary organization aimed at killing the USSR leadership; purposeful contamination of wells with typhoid bacilli, which led to an epidemic outbreak in Zaraisk; involvement of his scientific collaborators in an alleged counterrevolutionary organization. The investigative file of A. A. Zakharov, the documents from which are cited in the publication, was deposited in the fonds of the Department of the State Security Committee for Moscow and Moscow Region of the State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF). The introduction of these documents into the scientific turnover is explained by a number of reasons. Firstly, the presented selection allows to show the personality of Z. V. Ermolieva far away. V. Ermolieva's personality far beyond her scientific image. Secondly, through the prism of A. A. Zakharov's fate it is possible to reconstruct the mechanism of such arrests among scientists during the repressions of 1937-1938. Thirdly, the story in question allows us to demonstrate the involvement of Soviet science and its representatives in the political processes of the second half of the 1930s.

AB The article reviews the collection of documents "The Assault on Perekop in the Mirror of Historical Memory", prepared in 2023 by the staff of the Russian State Archive in Samara (hereinafter RGA) under the direction of O. N. Soldatova together with Samara, Moscow and Sevastopol historians, archivists and museum staff. The materials of the collection consisted of documents from six fonds of federal archives - the Russian State Archive in Samara, the Russian State Military Archive, the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History, as well as the Museum-Reserve of the Heroic Defense and Liberation of Sevastopol. The reviewers note that the compilers have carried out thorough preparatory work to identify, analyze and select complementary documents, the dominant part of which is being introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. In terms of the development of archaeographic methodology, the collection is promising in terms of the proposed interdisciplinary approach, which combines the potential of historical science, archival science, source and art history in covering one of the most important events of the Civil War and related domestic commemorative practice of the late 1930s. It is stated that in this focus the structure of the collection is logical: the first section is devoted to the history of the Perekop-Chongar operation of 1920, the second - to the largest Soviet pre-war art project - the battle panorama "The Assault on Perekop" (1934-1940), lost during the Great Patriotic War, the third section - to the All-Union competition of projects for the construction of the building for the panorama, held in 1940. The merits of the extensive and well-developed scientific and reference apparatus of the publication are emphasized. The numbering, dating, legends and titles of published documents are positive features of this structural part. The publication is provided with notes and comments on the content, a biographical guide, lists of abbreviations and sources and literature, demonstrating its high archeographic level. The value of the collection of documents is also due to the inclusion of visual sources: photographs of the creators of the panorama, sketches by M. M. Soloviev, drawings and blueprints of the building project for the panorama "Assault on Perekop". The authors of the review conclude that the publication has undoubted merits and the importance and relevance of its appearance in the world. Confidence is expressed in the emergence of interest of readers - historians, archival and museum workers, students, etc. to the reviewed novelty in a number of documentary collections and its active use in scientific and educational activities, as well as in the preparation of similar projects in the future.

DE European Union; Common Fisheries Policy; CFP; multilevel governance;

AB The article examines the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) of the European Union in the context of developments at the supranational level of governance. Although the CFP is rarely scrutinized by political scientists, the policy has a considerable political dimension due to states' sovereign interests in the seas, their connections the social stability of coastal communities, and the escalating struggle over access to the overexploited marine bioresources. The political basis of the Common Fisheries Policy lies in the principle of relative stability which was established in the early stages of the policy development and represents a political compromise between member states regarding catch shares. The current institutional framework of the CFP results from a recent reform initiated in 2013, influenced by the Lisbon Treaty, and eventually entered into force in 2019. This reform finalized the introduction the sustainable development agenda into policy, which changes the institutional balance and strengthens the role supranational authorities. Hence, the Common Fisheries Policy may be characterized as a predominantly supranational policy. Brexit and the increasing importance of the external policy dimension underpin the role of the EU institutions. However, the Council has preserved the exclusive prerogative to set quantitative limits on catches, which prevents the complete communitarization of the policy. In this way, growing politization overlaps with the ever-increasing technical complexity of the CFP. The former stems from the European Parliament activism and the supranational demand for expertise from the industry and expert community. As a result, the Commission empowers subnational actors in order to gain an advantage vis-& agrave;-vis national authorities that pursue their own interests over the community ones. Also, the article reveals the functional spillover in action, especially as a result of supranational effort to reach sustainable catches, namely multiannual plans, landing obligation. It requires new policy instruments along with general oversight by the Commission.

AB The article examines the ways the concept of a multipolar world is appealed to by politicians, diplomats, and international relations researchers in Mexico under the administration of Andr & eacute;s Manuel L & oacute;pez Obrador. A systematic analysis of Mexico's foreign policy is used as a methodological basis, which allows to take into consideration global developments, the way the government shapes foreign policy, and the role of the president that influences this process, as well as material and normative factors. The instruments of discourse and content analysis are also applied in the research. The authors consider the features of addressing the semantic code of multipolarity among different groups of policy- makers and analyze the contexts and topics that are associated with it. The research concludes that, although the issue of the formation of a multipolar world is generally relevant for various groups of policy- makers in Mexico, the discourse on multipolarity cannot be considered dominant and lacks a specific strategy for the international positioning of the nation.

AB The article analyses the electoral participation of non-citizens of third countries residing in the member states of the European Union in the context of the integration policy of immigrants. The aim of the work is to assess the level of participation of non-citizens from third countries in municipal elections, depending on the degree of electoral inclusion in European states. Examples of countries with different systems of granting active voting rights to non-naturalised immigrants are Sweden, Finland, Belgium and Luxembourg. In order to achieve this goal, a theoretical and conceptual basis for the study, built upon the theory of integration of immigrants through participation, was formulated, and the participation rate of non-citizens from third countries in the municipal legislatures of Sweden, Finland, Belgium and Luxembourg was examined. Nowadays, in a number of European states, voting rights are an instrument of integration policy, as increased electoral opportunities for non-citizens of third countries in municipal elections encourage their inclusion in the host society. At the same time, by providing the opportunity to vote, governments have introduced additional implicit exclusion mechanisms that, in the context of discrimination, xenophobia and language problems, significantly reduce the participation of unnaturalized immigrants. As a result, three "ideal" types of access systems for non-naturalised immigrants from third countries to municipal elections have emerged within the European Union: exclusive, partially inclusive and inclusive. Among the countries surveyed, Sweden is one of the most inclusive, with the highest turnout of non-citizens from third countries. Finland, Belgium and Luxembourg have partially inclusive systems that imply institutional and symbolic barriers to participation. Participation in these countries is lower than in Sweden, and the more restrictive the system, the lower the participation rates. Thus, the voter turnout and degree of integration into the host society of the social group surveyed were lower in countries with a less inclusive electoral system. In states with varying degrees of electoral inclusion, non-citizens' participation in elections has increased over time, but they continue to be inferior to naturalised immigrants and birthright citizens, while the acquisition of citizenship is a key tool for their integration into the political system of the recipient society. As such, voting rights cannot stimulate integration; a systemic integration policy, additional incentives for participation, information and advertising campaigns are needed.

TI Traditionalism in China's State Governance: Regional Specificity
SO REGIONOLOGIYA-REGIONOLOGY RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF REGIONAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE state governance in China; regional specificity of traditionalism; big
   state tradition; little tradition; modern model of public administration
AB Introduction. The relevance of the study is due to the increasing importance and influence of global and, at the same time, regional processes on the process of governance. The purpose of the article is to identify the regional specifics of traditionalism as a systemic phenomenon in the processes of state governance in China; in this case, we consider China as a region participating in global and transregional relations. Materials and Methods. The study is based on sociologist R. Redfield's concept of social organization tradition, which distinguished between "big" and "small" traditions, and the adaptation of this concept in Chinese sociology. In order to identify the relationship between traditionalism and Chinese specificity of public administration in their historical aspect and to determine the current region-specific trends of traditionalism's influence on public administration, scientific studies of Chinese sociologists were analyzed. Results. In particular, the systemic characteristics of traditionalism are examined along two interrelated dimensions: philosophical, which determines the value orientations of society, and practical, which aims to ensure stable social interaction. Special attention is paid to the "great state tradition", which in modern Asia with China as an example manifests itself in the adaptation of traditional management concepts to modern conditions. The processes of penetration of traditional values into political discourse and ideology are studied, emphasizing that modern traditionalism is not a return to the past, but a tool for searching for arguments in the past to actualize modern managment concepts. Discussion and conclusion. The regional specificity of state governance is largely determined by the "big state tradition", which remains a significant factor of the governance system in China, influences the "little tradition" and seeks ways to adapt to it. The practical significance of the article lies in the possibility of using its results in planning interaction with administrative departments and public structures of the PRC.

   cooperation; institutionalization of interaction formats within the
   BRICS; BRICS summits
AB Modern international architecture, formed in the post-war period, is in the process of transformation, gradually changing configuration- the unipolar concept of the world order is being replaced by a multipolar one. In the context of this international trend, the BRICS interstate association is of particular interest, striving to establish the concept of multipolarity in the practice of international relations. This, in turn, predetermined the purpose of the research, which was to study the historical and law aspects of the BRICS activities and determine the prospects for its progressive functioning. The article, based on an analysis of political science, economic and legal literature, shows the prerequisites for the formation of BRICS, as well as the historical stages of the evolution of the association, which occupies one of the leading places in the international arena. The evolutionary path of the BRICS was identified through the study of the final documents of the annual BRICS summits, systematization and generalization of the information contained in them. The gradual (2009-2023) institutionalization of interaction formats within the BRICS is traced, including the emergence of new organizational mechanisms, such as the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Foreign Exchange Reserve Pool (CCR). The legal status of the group and the prospects for international cooperation of the participating states are analyzed separately. It is noted that in terms of legal status, BRICS is a paraorganization of a transcontinental type, since, on the one hand, it does not have the characteristic features of an international intergovernmental organization (charter, autonomy, permanent bodies), on the other hand, it has institutionalized mechanisms of interstate cooperation. Promising areas of international cooperation among members of the BRICS group include the transition to settlements in national currency in foreign trade activities, liberalization of international trade turnover within the group, deepening energy cooperation, as well as expanding the composition of the group with new members. In conclusion, it is concluded that BRICS is a promising and in the future popular format for interaction between developing countries with a universal agenda and can be considered as an international center of influence representing the interests of dynamically developing countries.

DT Article
DE volunteer activity; social activity; student youth; socio-political
   mobilization; areas of volunteering
AB Introduction. The relevance of the research is conditioned by the presence of a sustainable institutional request of the authorities and the public sector regarding the development of youth civic potential. However, young people demonstrate an inert format of mobilisation of social activity resources. The aim of the study is to analyse the dynamic environment of student volunteer activity. Young people's choices and evaluations of the content, scope and variety of voluntary activities shows obvious vectors of typical choice, resource uniqueness, and also demonstrates examples of a number of typological regional areas and topics. Materials and Methods. The study used a systems approach and structural-functional analysis in order to substantiate the issue of regional student volunteering. . The basis for the analysis was the results of the authors' own research on the topic: "Volunteer activity of student youth in Kuzbass" (n = 715), conducted in 2023-2024, reports on the implementation of volunteer projects in the Kemerovo region - Kuzbass for 2022. Results. The implementation of volunteer activities in the region can be carried out in a consolidated manner or have multidirectional vectors for applying the activity and resource potential of student youth. The conditions of socio-political communication determine a certain dynamics, intensity, and temporality of volunteer activities. Analysis of the results of a questionnaire survey among young people revealed a contradiction: respondents offer recommendations for practical improvement in the organization of volunteer activities, but find it difficult to identify the subjects of implementation of these changes. Discussion and Conclusion. Student volunteering is defined as an interaction that is built in the form of interactive multifunctional relationships, when the interests of the parties involved are interconnected in a combination of requests from the drivers of volunteering, stakeholders and experts, as well as the performers of the volunteer role themselves. The results obtained are of practical significance for volunteer organizers, regional supervisors, authorities, directly to regional volunteer communities and young people.

AB Introduction. The study of the peculiarities of foreign policy orientations of various social groups is of great importance for modern Russian society and requires comprehensive analysis in the context of the ongoing transformations of the world order and international tensions. The purpose of the research is to determine the structure and dynamics of foreign policy orientations of Russian youth in modern conditions. Materials and Methods. Analysis of all-Russian surveys on similar topics was conducted; the results of quantitative and qualitative author's studies conducted in 2023-2024 among youth of the Russian regions: Penza, Saratov and Tyumen regions were analyzed. This made it possible to identify the dominant foreign policy orientations of young people and reveal the degree of support for Russia's political course in the international arena. Results. The author's structural model is presented, reflecting the essential content and main components of the system of foreign policy orientations of Russians, based on the Russian foreign policy approach at three levels: cognitive, identification-evaluation and activity. The author's research allowed to obtain new data on the system and dominant foreign policy orientations, their direction and current dynamics; the similarity of foreign policy orientations of youth in different regions was determined and some of their differences in the socio-demographic section were revealed. Discussion and Conclusion. The foreign policy orientations of modern young people are highly developed, which is reflected both at the cognitive and at the identification-evaluation level. A positive image of Russia has been formed in their consciousness; they fully share Russia's leading role in the modern world order and demonstrate understanding and acceptance of the foreign policy decisions made. The obtained results can be used in improving the conceptual framework of youth policy and the system of civic education of modern youth.

AB The article explores Germany's changing foreign policy orientations in the context of the Ukrainian crisis since February 2022. The Russian Special military operation in Ukraine served as a trigger for Olaf Scholz's government to publish new strategic documents designed to consolidate the changes in the German approachto Russia. These mainly include: National Security Strategy, Guidelines for Feminist Foreign Policy, Strategy on China, and Defense Policy Guidelines. They see Russia as the biggest threat to German and European security. This thesis is meant to justify the abandonment of pacifist traditions. It is noted that the concept of the "Russian threat" is becoming universal and significantly complicates the prospects of future normalization of Russian- German relations. According to the federal government, the response to the "Russian threat", in addition to supporting Ukraine, should be a set of non-military measures in the field of economy, technology, information space, and inter- societal relations. The complexity of practical implementation of the measures towards Russia stated in the documents is emphasized. It is noted that by now, there is a shift in Germany's security priorities, with Russia moving to the seventh place in the list of threats. These changes are accompanied by growing dissatisfaction of the German population with Berlin's domestic and foreign policy. Despite possible changes within Germany in reference to future elections, is concluded that the probability of adjusting the confrontational approach remains low due to the need to revise the guiding documents. The study points to a major and long-term shift in Germany's policy towards Russia, which affects security and stability in Europe.

AB Economy is one of the basic systems of human being, and economic concepts are used in various sciences, sometimes in unexpected combinations. One of these is the concept of economic ideology, used for quite a long time, but most widely in recent decades, and in various meanings. At the same time, its actual economic studies are rare, so that in fact it is used in political science, sociology and psychology. This discrepancy defines the objectives of the article: to analyze the main practices of using the concept of economic ideology and to propose a way to organize them, or propose a typology, based on which it would be possible to identify the directions of economic analysis of this concept. Such studies would allow us to develop the study of the subjective information, in particular beliefs, impact on economic decision-making.

   Community of Common Destiny; India; North-South International Transport
   Corridor; Belt and Road Initiative
AB The risks of institutionalizing the format of the Central Asia-China dialogue ("C+C5") for solidarity and mutual political trust within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) are considered. According to the documents, institutionalization is aimed at transforming the "C+C5" format into a full-fledged international intergovernmental organization with functions that duplicate the existing ones within the SCO. In the current official documents, Russia has declared the importance of SCO development and has assigned it a special role in the implementation of the "Turn to the East" Policy, the development of the "Greater Eurasian Partnership," and the deployment of the project of the "North-South International Transport Corridor." In this regard, further institutionalization of the "C+C5" format may create restrictions for the realization of these Russian plans and even for the protection of interests in the Central Asian region (CAR). This circumstance, coupled with the active attempts of the West and the United States to force a number of CAR countries to refuse Russia's assistance in circumventing the sanctions regime, is unlikely to be understood in Moscow. This means that it is necessary to think about ways to overcome the likely limitations by deepening the dialog with China on the issues of further development of the SCO and increasing its effectiveness. Plans to institutionalize the "C+C5" format may also cause increased opposition from other major global "players" such as the United States, India, the European Union, and Japan, which have been actively involved in Central Asian Affairs in recent years, developing formats for dialogue between "1 + C5" (CAR countries).

AB When and how does an environmental protest cycle affect election outcomes under electoral authoritarianism? Drawing on the case of the Bashkortostan republic, a Russian ethnic region, I leverage the spatial proximity to the protest site to identify its effects on parliamentary elections. The environmental protest cycle peaked in Bashkortostan around the regional government's decisions to extract minerals from shikhans - mountains composed of limestone. Employing a difference-in-differences (DiD) design, I show that precincts exposed to the environmental protest cycle experienced a significant drop in United Russia vote share, while voting for systemic opposition increased in the affected precincts. To explain the dynamics, I propose treating non-political protests, such as environmental ones, as an information revelation mechanism. The mechanism identified through a causal mediation analysis indicates that the environmental protest cycle conveys information on regional malperformance to voters. Their updated preferences, in turn, heavily undermine the electoral mobilizing capacity of local elites.

AB The article consists of three parts. The first contains a theoretical analysis of the phenomenon of US political polarization and discusses the main approaches to its explanation, primarily through the prism of the influence of political elites. The authors note a logical contradiction in the existing concepts, which postulate the existence of an "asymmetry" in the influence of elites on polarization in the United States, arguing that the contribution of the Republicans is more destructive than the contribution of representatives of the Democratic Party. The authors find the growth of political polarization, regardless of party preferences (while noting the importance of elite behavior as one of the central factors of political polarization). The second part examines the phenomenon of affective (or emotional polarization), based on the socio-psychological rejection of representatives of an alien political camp. Based on the results of a network analysis of a two-modal network consisting of pre-election messages and topics selected by the authors themselves, the author notes that all candidates, without exception, are prone to emotional affect as part of their election campaign. The third part is devoted to the study of positional (or ideological) polarization, in which the author, on the basis of Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis, divides the corpus of campaign messages of candidates into separate topics and, through a comparative analysis, finds a significant distance from "bipartisan" topics (i.e. from the political center) among all candidates.

AB The parliamentary elections in Britain in 2024 brought the expected victory of the Labour party and a crushing defeat to the Conservatives. However, the success of the Labour party is due to its tactics in the conditions of a majoritarian electoral system and the deep dissatisfaction of voters with Tory rule, and not to the socio-economic and political election program and not to the party leader K. Starmer, who lacks charisma. The majoritarian system also disproportionately favored the Liberal Democrat Party and did not favor the reformist party of N. Farage. Labour won back a significant part of the votes from the crisis-stricken Scottish National Party. Since it is unlikely that the Tories will be able to overcome the internal party crisis by the next election, Labour will remain in power for two Parliamentary terms. The foreign policy of the K. Starmer government will be a continuation of the conservative one, but conceptually it will take shape of "progressive realism". Britain will continue to follow the United States, regardless of the party in power in Washington, will strive to maintain a leading position in NATO, assist the Kiev regime, maneuver in relations with China, actively oppose Russia and try to attract the countries of the Global South.

DT Article
DE public diplomacy; hybrid warfare; information warfare; Russian- American
   relations; U.S.A.; soft power; political warfare; world order; Ukraine;
   disinformation; propaganda; reputational security
AB The article reflects on the political war between the United States and Russia that started in 2022 with the launch of the Russian special military operation in Ukraine. The author compares those events to the political war that occurred between the U.S. and the USSR in the 20th century, concluding that once again the American side has chosen to begin with a reactive and defensive approach to the conflict. This approach is primarily aimed at safeguarding the American population (as well as the population ofAmerican allies) from Russian influence. In order to achieve that, American public diplomacy institutes (key actors in terms of waging war for the people's minds and hearts) focused on deconstructing Russian narratives and discrediting Russian information sources. At the same time, the ability of Russian public diplomacy institutes and media to reach Western audiences was paralysed by sanctions and other restrictions. However, the purpose of building resilient defenses to protect American public from foreign influence was mostly achieved through the system of governmental control over the internal information space. This system connects governmental structures responsible for countering disinformation with tech companies and leading social media, and thus allows censorship of every topic coming from any source if deemed concerning national security. After safeguarding the internal information space, in 2024, the United States moved towards extending the defensive approach to political war towards allies, aiming at building the same resilient defenses for their publics. Meanwhile, during the past years, the American public diplomacy, which suffered from atrophy, underfunding and lack of leadership since the end of the Cold War, was being reformed in a way that enhances its effectiveness, strengthens capabilities for dealing with target audiences and integrates a more politically oriented approach. Thus, while ensuring the protection of its population from the adversary's influence, the U.S. have also been upgrading its arsenal of effective instruments required for political war and effective influencing of foreign public opinion. Bearing in mind the previous experience of political war between the two states, the author concludes that after securing the information space of allies and completing the modernization of public diplomacy capabilities, the Washington is likely to move from defensive to offensive tactic in political warfare. Moreover, those offensive and proactive actions will be most likely realized collectively, together with allies. A theoretical basis for such an approach is being currently developed through the emergence of "reputational security" concept in American expert discourse. This concept not only elevates the issues of reputation (of the states, democracy, liberal values) to the category of national security issues, but also pushes for collective action in terms of protecting one's own reputation and undermining the reputation of an adversary.

   candidates; weapons deliveries to Ukraine; NATO
AB The foreign policy agenda in the American presidential campaign, unlike how it was throughout almost the entire U.S. history, turned into a hot topic during the election campaign of 2023-2024. Military assistance to Ukraine became an important part of this pre-election period. The positions of Democratic and Republican parties continued to grow apart on this issue, this split on a foreign policy topic also being quite unpreceded until recently. Though during the current election campaign, almost all presidential candidates, with very rare exceptions, came out in favor of military assistance to Ukraine, yet the majority of the Republican contenders alleged that this conflict ought not be a primary focus, and called upon the administration to identify its strategic goals in Ukraine and limit the weapons deliveries to the realization of these goals. They saw China, not Russia, as the major challenge. Meanwhile, Joe Biden and other Democratic contenders increasingly voiced the argument that the weapons deliveries to Ukraine were important not only for this country, but for the United States itself and for the whole world, and if they did not come in time or in sufficient quantities, Russia would present a threat to its neighboring countries, and Europe could be facing a major war. After the Hamas's attack on Israel, the resistance of the Republican fraction in Congress to voting in favor of allocating means for military assistance to Ukraine increased, while the White House found itself in a position where it had to distribute its foreign aid between the Ukrainian conflict and the Middle East crisis. Although during the two years of the election campaign, Donald Trump's popularity grew, and his control over the Republican party expanded, there were some Republicans, and presidential candidates in particular, who criticized Biden not for excessive, but for insufficient support to Ukraine. Yet the political forecasts for a possible second term for Trump were commonly associated with a decrease in U.S. weapons supplies to Ukraine.

AB The purpose of the article is to generalize and compare the similarities and differences in pedagogical education in Russia, Germany and China, to identify modern practices of developing professional initiatives of future teachers in their training at universities in Germany and China. The choice of Germany and China for the study is justified by the fact that these countries are relatively polar in political and geographical aspects, but their education systems, including pedagogical, have always been of significant interest to Russian educators (both theorists and practitioners), and educational contacts between Russia and Germany and China are historically quite long. In addition, recently there has been a mutual scientific interest of German and Chinese scientists in each other's education systems. The research methods are the analysis of domestic and foreign scientific and pedagogical literature, dissertations in Russian, German and English and domestic dissertations; study of the content of the websites of a number of universities in Germany and China, where pedagogical education is implemented; reflection of one's own experience of academic cooperation and visits to educational institutions of the above-mentioned countries; generalization of the results of the analysis, conclusions. The study materials included scientific publications (domestic and foreign), dissertations of Russian and Chinese researchers, and the content of the websites of 10 German and Chinese universities. The study compared the features of teacher training in Germany and Russia, China and Russia (their similarities and differences), and identified the reasons for the similarities in this training. Specific examples of elements of proactive teacher training found on the websites of German and Chinese universities were identified and summarized, including their infrastructure, training models that facilitate the development of initiatives of future teachers. The German universities whose websites were studied included the University of G & ouml;ttingen, Humboldt University of Berlin, Erlangen-Nuremberg University, Heidelberg Pedagogical University, and the University of Duisburg-Essen; the corresponding Chinese universities included Beijing, Hebei, Tsinghua, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. The study identified global trends characteristic of pedagogical education in Russia, Germany, and China; It was established that the similarities between Russian and German pedagogical education are due to the influence of the Bologna system, Russian and Chinese - convergence on many issues of teacher training, intensification of interaction in the educational sphere, etc.; an increased focus on identifying and supporting initiatives in teacher training in both Germany and China was revealed, with a simultaneous focus on systematizing these processes; it was determined that a number of ideas for proactive teacher training presented in German and Chinese universities can be adapted by Russian pedagogical education.

AB The ongoing foreign policy failures of France in Africa, primarily in the countries of the Sahel zone, force to pay close attention to the mechanisms of decision-making in this area. The key focus of the article is the role of the academic community in the foreign policy expertise of France, its personnel composition, affiliation with the main government actors (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, French Development Agency), research centers and universities. The authors' concept of four concentric communities of applied research on Africa is presented in function of their influence on foreign policy decision-making. The most influential representatives working at the intersection of thematic areas of African studies, development studies and international security issues are studied. These areas of research act as markers of applied African studies. A multi-criteria analysis of the affiliation of the main participants was carried out. Conclusions are drawn about the features of the system of French foreign policy expertise in Africa. Special attention is paid to works that critically assess France's current foreign policy strategy on the continent, highlighting both systemic and "unconventional" critics who move i nto the category of political activists. The problems and prospects for the development of two main scientific journals on African studies are revealed ("Modern Africa" and "African Politics"). The insignificant role of immigrants from the continent in African studies of France is demonstrated. Despite an extensive network of scientific partnerships uniting dozens of French universities and African institutes, there is no deep integration of Africans into the French academy, which also reduces the quality of African expertise.

DE values; value orientations; value of knowledge; students; Slavic world
AB Currently, most countries of the post-Soviet space are in a state of transition.A rightwing conservative turn from the socio-political model of liberal democracy is taking place. This process generates a demand for research into values, which in the Russian speaking environment are one of the mechanisms for constructing society. The aim of this work is to study the value of knowledge in the structure of value orientations of students in Slavic countries through a comparative analysis of research papers devoted to the designated topic. For a substantive analysis of the values of students in Slavic universities, 88 publications were selected, of which 15 focused on Russian values, 11 - on Belarusian, 14 - on Ukrainian, 18 - on Polish, 18 - on Bulgarian, 7 - on Czech, and 5 - on Serbian. The selected articles are primarily written in English to overcome the differences in the language dialects of the Slavs. Based on the collected material, the values of students studying in Slavic universities were analyzed and compared, and the attitude to the value of knowledge among the students was separately identified. Based on the entire array of the analyzed literature, a number of conclusions can be made. Firstly, the value orientations of students of individual Slavic nations are often studied by local scientists,while European researchers this is a single post-Soviet space. Secondly, as a rule, studying the values of Slavic youth, local scholars simultaneously solve their own local social, domestic political, and ethnic problems, like the integration of certain social groups into society, reinforcement of the chosen national path of development, etc. Thirdly, the value of education and knowledge is often omitted or does not occupy priority positions among most Slavic studies. The authors emphasize that this thesis should not be generalized here.At present,there is a certain opposition between Russian and Belarusian students, who value knowledge significantly higher, and other Slavic nations, where it is,as a rule, significantly lower. Fourthly, the values of student youth of many nations are a question of identity of future generations; however, if for some nations this is a question of transition from Soviet to European identity, then for Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians it is a question of searching for it, including outside of European identity. Therefore, there is no single concept of perception of values in the studies of these countries.

   Agency; development aid; EUROGENDFOR; European integration
AB Despite the growing relevance of the case of Franco-Moldovan relations, little attention has been paid to their study outside the context of European integration processes. This study seeks to fill this gap by identifying and summarizing the current status, specificity and context of French foreign policy in Moldova, the key interests of the parties towards each other, as well as the main challenges and tasks they are facing. The results of the study show that until 2021, the bilateral dynamic was rather inert. The Republic of Moldova (RM) did not rank high in the system of Paris's foreign policy priorities even after the sharp increase in the confrontation between the Russian Federation and the EU in 2014. Although the Moldovan vector of French foreign policy is now ranked alongside other post-Soviet countries, the results show that the starting position from which France's activation in RM began is very different from the inputs that for many years shaped the French geopolitical optics in other parts of the former USSR - in the Caucasus and even in Central Asia. The year 2021 has become a reference point in this relationship because a political configuration favorable to France has begun to emerge in Moldova. For Chisinau, the need to gain favor with Paris is critical in the context of its stated goals of European integration. In the case of France, the motivation looks much more multilayered, but it is summarized by Paris's desire to take the Moldovan plot into circulation in order to reassemble its self-positioning as a leader in the EU.

DE history of Russian political and legal thought; G.N. Potanin; N.M.
   Yadrintsev; Siberian regionalism; colonization; exile to Siberia;
   vagrancy; criminalization of the region
AB Within the framework of this study, an attempt is made to reconstruct the political and legal views of the Siberian regionalists G.N. Potanin and N.M. Yadrintsev. The ideological legacy of democratic regionalists isemphasized on the problem of negative factors in the social life of pre-revolutionary Siberia through the growth of crime in the region and short-sighted penitentiary policy. Based on the hermeneutic analysis of published sources -journalistic and scientifically significant articles of political and legal content, as well as books by famous Siberians, the determinants of social ill-being in the Asian part of the Russian Empire are identified, such as a constant increase in crime, robberies, mass hard labor and exile, vagrancy. It is shown that in the political and legal thought of the leaders of the regionalist movement it was noted that the issue of punishment in the history of mankind from the beginning of the centuries to the modern period of development of the state and law constitutes that fatal, global issue that has not been positively resolved either by human practice or by the theory of legal science. The authors note that the thinkers believed that the system of penalties in laws and regulations in most countries is very similar. They analyzed mainly codified acts of European countries. Textual analysis clearly demonstrated to the writers practically identical forms of criminal-legal influence from the death penalty of exile to corporal punitive effects.The authors come to the conclusion that the humanistic political and legal thought of N.M.Yadrintsev and G.N. Potanin was characterized by the methodology of quantitative and statistical analysis, which in turn, in the knowledge of the social practices of the Siberian region, clearly and convincingly showed the detrimental impact of the miscalculations of the penal colonization of the region on its social development. Also, as a result of the work done, it is noted that, according to the legal viewsof regional thinkers, thecriminalization of the population, the growth of crime, countless thefts, the poverty of the lower strata of the population and social insecurity have long been faithful companions of the Siberian "melting pot"

AB The article is devoted to the investment strategy of the European Union "Global Gateway". Official documents and publicly available information on flagship projects served as an analytical basis for identifying the objectives of the relevant initiative of the European Commission, announced in 2021. The failure of experts' attempts to operationalise the strategy was noted due to the lack of convincing facts of its implementation and measurable results. The author discusses the reasons for the unsuccessful start of the Global Gate initiative. They consist in the unfavorable political environment, the limited and narrow focus of financial incentives from the EU, which turn off private investment. The approach to relations with external countries, called open strategic autonomy, applied by the "geopolitical Commission" under the leadership of Ursula von der Leyen, conserve the concept of the EU's normative power as a basis, is complemented by a semantic focus on projects that meet the interests of restoring the EU's leadership position in global competition. During 2022-2023, the European think tanks supported the initiative by making recommendations for attracting capital to the proposed projects. Nevertheless, economic actors, having demonstrated interest, remained in the position of observers. Thus, the initiative did not overcome the initial stage of diplomatic memorandums and roadmaps. According to the author of the article, the announced reform will be formal, namely, aimed at saving the initiative, appeasing partner non-governmental organisations advocating for the UN Sustainable Development Goals, continuing scientific research, conducting communication events and fueling the technical component of flagship projects.

TI Geoeconomic Turn: Policy Priorities of the Next EU Commission
SO CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA

DT Article
DE European Union; European Commission; economic security; competitiveness;
   green deal; industrial policy; strategic autonomy; geoeconomic turn;
   climate goals
AB The next institutional cycle of the EU begins in a period of unprecedented uncertainty in the global economy and large-scale problems in the European economic space. The author explores possible economic and political directions in the activities of the new composition of the European Commission. A hypothesis is that the main priority will be to ensure the competitiveness of the European space, the development of new regulatory documents of a geo-economic nature and their implementation. An assessment of the genesis of the new economic and political stage with an analysis of the main regulatory decisions is presented. The article also focuses on economic initiatives for 2023-early 2024 to ensure economic security and anti-subsidy regulation. These decisions are very significant as they form a drift f rom the "geopolitical" to the "geoeconomic" role of the Commission. Further, the priorities of the economic policy of the new European Commission are consisted of three components: ensuring raw material security, maximising the competitiveness of the EU, protecting the adopted climate goals with partnership with the widest possible range of countries. The analysis demonstrated a significant weakening of the EU's position in the world economy, associated with a lag in productivity. The author concludes that the main risks of the "geoeconomic turn" are in the political sphere. Its actors may not be able to overcome numerous obstacles to implement the new industrial course, associated with the need to take into account the heterogeneous impact of various industries on the EU economy. The approaches of the article can be valuiable for studying other countries and regions in which economic policy integrates the search for efficiency in responses to external challenges.

TI Navalny's Trade Unions between Socioeconomic and Political Demands
SO RUSSIAN POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Navalny; populism; protests; trade unions
AB The article examines Alexei Navalny's trade unions that emerged in 2018-2019 and ceased their activities in 2021-2022. These unions were supposed to contribute to the development of Navalny's movement and the integration of labor protests into the political movement. The article considers Navalny's unions as an attempt to unify socioeconomic and political demands and addresses factors hindering this unification. The article utilizes Ernesto Laclau's theory of populism with some modifications. While Laclau's works usually neglect organizational issues and repertoires of protest, this analysis also focuses on organizational structures and repertoires of Navalny's unions. The article demonstrates that Navalny's unions became servicing organizations which cannot be conducive to populism. Repression, the servicing model of organizations, the ability of the existing political system to satisfy some social demands from below and the adherence of trade unions and employees to repertoires of complaint-making, hindered the development of Navalny's trade unions and populism in Russia.

DT Article
DE international settlements; international digital union; metaverse; smart
   contract; stablecoin; distributed ledger technology; central bank
   digital currency; digital payment space
AB In the context of general globalization, the information society in digital realities faced the problem of ensuring national sovereignty. On the one hand, the threat to the banking system is the expanding ecosystem of alternative finance on the sidelines of the metaverse. On the other hand, the problem is aggravated by the forced localization and segmentation of the settlement and payment space: there are negative consequences of the payment systems dependence on the political beliefs of their administrators. As aresult, the focus on the world multipolarity required the response of government agencies in the vector of searching for adigital channel for cross- border movement of monetary value. The attractiveness of the digital trusted environment is embodied in the "ideology+technology" complex. There are two approaches to integrating high-tech innovations into the global financial system: a)conformist, when only the technological component with the predominant preservation of the traditional economic structure is taken into account, and b)eccentric, combining fourth- generation web technologies and classical elements of centralization in the focus of the inextricable link between technology and innovation ideology. The authors conclude that the centralization characteristic of the first approach transforms high-tech innovation with its loss of specific features. This makes the solution (legitimate settlement stablecoin) unpromising. This implementation of the "digital" settlement format not only does not facilitate the design by disintermediation and providing users with the opportunity to directly participate in the movement of value, but, on the contrary, complicates it by entering additional participants. The search for selfsufficient conservative tools for cross- border transfers is archaism: the global digitalization race suggests that in the foreseeable future, no leading country will cede its leading position in the segment of supranational digital settlements, recognizing and accepting a competitor's digital (crypto) asset as a potential impetus to currency hegemony. A nontrivial solution to the second approach is a digital service like a data container that officially translates the key values of the digital world into a trusted web 4.0 environment. It will provide participants in the international "digital" union with information exchange with a guarantee of independence through financial decisions at the national level. At the same time, the number of transfer stages using smart contracts is reduced, and the applying of artificial intelligence and smart analysis tools has a high potential to improve the quality of control and monitoring. Thus, during the period of expanding the opportunities of the virtual world, the role of metaverse as a new format of interaction is growing, capable of uniting participants at a new level of the settlement and payment space organization. It is advisable not to localize the new formation, but to segment it according to national characteristics with a guarantee of its international interactivity.

AB The article analyzes the principles that determine the US policy towards the PRC in terms of ideological confrontation and struggle for the influence in the Indo-Pacific region. It is noted that such features of the Chinese political system as rule by law, autocracy and state-directed mercantilism are seen as its vulnerabilities. The U.S. competitive approach to the PRC is focused on exacerbating and exploiting them. China's economic slowdown is expected to make the CCP uncertain of its own legitimacy and force the party to rely on authoritarian practices of social control to maintain political power. This, in its turn, will provoke social discontent and decrease support for the party among the population. Restrictions on Chinese technology companies and tightening of the counterintelligence regime against Chinese undergraduate and graduate students studying at U.S. universities are intended to impede China's access to advanced technologies and developments. Beijing's actions, interpreted as authoritarian practices, are used by Washington to rally allies and partners on the ideological basis and to justify sanctions. These actions include the re-education policy in Xinjiang, the Hong Kong policy, export of Chinese technological systems and internal control practices to the Indo-Pacific countries, and others. It is indicated that this approach was countered by the Washington's right to free access to information and policy to protect Internet freedom. In the real world, it aims to undermine state control over information in countries that import Chinese practices of social control. The key role in implementing this approach is assigned to systems that will circumvent Internet traffic restrictions both in the Indo-Pacific states and in China itself. The U.S. approach to defense and security in the Indo-Pacific region focuses on the transition from a hub-and-spoke system to federated defense. It is recognized that while the federated approach initially focused on the U.S. allies, Washington is now integrating its regional partners as well. There are two stages in the implementation of this U.S. defense strategy. During the first stage, Washington creates separate elements of the future military alliance which still function as independent units. Such elements are represented by minilateral coalitions that are formed of states that have comparable or complementary capabilities in spheres that are key to China's deterrence. These include AUKUS focused on building nuclear submarines, the upcoming trilateral alliance of Japan, South Korea, and the United States in missile defense, QUAD, and others. During the second stage, it is probably intended to unite the established coalitions under a single defense structure. It is pointed out that Washington's choice in favor of this two-stage scheme is due to the need to refrain at the current stage from actions that would provoke the states of the region to choose a side between the United States and China, which would be inevitable in the case of creation of a full-fledged U.S. military alliance in the Indo-Pacific. It is noticed that the Biden administration effectively counters Beijing in international organizations. It has largely succeeded in frustrating China's strategy to dominate them and in transforming them from within.

TI Identists vs. Antiidentists: A Prologue to the Ukrainian Crisis
SO CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE identism; antiidentism; liberal democracy; traditionalism; parties and
   social and political movements; problems of indentity; Ukrainian crisis
AB The article analyzes the features of modern ideological and political conflicts in Europe and the world, in particular, the process of crystallization of the identist ideology (identism), which opposes the values of "liberal democracy" (antiidentism) on the eve of the Ukrainian crisis. It is emphasized that the struggle for identity has become a form of defending attractive meanings and defending sovereign models of development as opposed to ultraliberalism. The confrontation between traditionalists and antitraditionalists has become an integral element of the dynamics of divided societies. That context could help to understand the deepening of the ideological withstanding during Ukrainian crisis. The article examines party-political differences and ideological conflicts in the public sphere, describes the origins of the emergence of modern antiidentism, the growth of identist sentiments and the reaction to this growth from the supporters of antiidentism. The factors of weakening of identism were the struggle with political rivals, in the United States against Trump and Trumpism, in the European Union against parties and movements of the identism orientation ("populists"), the cri minalization of identist views within the framework of the imposition of gender policy, during the pandemic the marginalization of identist principles in the context of sanitary policy. It is concluded that within the framework of the emerging polycentric world the confrontation of two ideological systems - identism and antiidentism is gradually taking shape. The most important feature of this confrontation is the significant presence of supporters of various opposing parties in almost all countries and regions of the world. All Western identists declared themselves as the unconditional supporters of democratic values in the traditional sense of classical liberalism - separation of powers, free elections, and civil liberties. They see themselves as fighters for their revival in modern Europe and in the United States, as opposed to the monopoly of antiidentism.

DT Article
DE popular scientific discourse; linguistic pragmatics; ethos; pathos;
   logos; tactics and strategies of persuasion; popular scientific
   discourse; linguistic pragmatics; ethos; pathos; logos; tactics and
   strategies of persuasion
AB This article is written within the framework of pragmatics and discourse analysis and is aimed at revealing discursive strategies and tactics of persuasion in popular science discourse through the example of popular- science articles on global warming published at the Heartland Institute website, which promotes an alternative view on the issue of global warming and climate change in general. With the help of the discursive and pragmalinguistic methods of analysis within the framework of the Aristotelian persuasive strategies of ethos (credibility and reliability of information presented), pathos (emotive charge and emotional impact), and logos (logical reasoning and factual representation of information), fifteen linguistic tactics are revealed to convince readers of the aforementioned article of the validity of the solar hypothesis of climate change by comparing this hypothesis with the anthropogenic theory of global warming, which appears to be the leading one in the environmental and political spheres. The authors of the articles under analysis debunk the human-induced theory of global warming and put forward the alternative solar theory, which, according to the authors of the article, is disregarded for political reasons. The authors of this popular-scientific article equally utilize the strategies of ethos, pathos and logos, supporting each of them with a relatively balanced number of tactics (logos is represented by five tactics, ethos by four tactics, and pathos by six tactics). Nevertheless, it should be noted that the linguistic expression of pathos is represented by a larger number of examples (25 micro-contexts), which indicates an emotional attitude to the problem of global warming and may be regarded as an attempt to influence primarily the affective sphere of the readers' psyche. Moreover, it is revealed that the three abovementioned strategies contain elements of appraisal either in the form of opponents' criticism or the proponents' praise and support. Since the solar theory of global warming currently remains only a hypothesis along with other hypotheses, the journalists' aim is to make the addressee believe in this hypothesis first of all on the emotional level and then on the rational one. This method of speech impact analysis based on the strategies of ethos, pathos and logos can be applied to any popular science text as one of the critical discourse analysis tools for assessing ways to influence the addressee.

DT Article
DE China; "ecological civilization"; Pan Yue; Green Revolution; Sustainable
   Development; green agenda; environmental policy; green transition; green
   economy; five-year plan
AB The article is devoted to the Chinese concept of "ecological civilization", which underlies the modern "green" strategy of the PRC. The prerequisites for its emergence are thoroughly examined: the influence of the international "green" agenda, current environmental problems in China, the background to the formation of an integrated state environmental policy in the PRC. The essence of the "ecological civilization" concept is revealed in terms of the aspiration of the Chinese leadership, on the one hand, to implement its unique approach to the interaction between human society and nature, based on the principles of harmony from traditional Chinese culture, and opposite to the "violent", hegemonic Western approach; on the other hand - to play a leading role in the current global "green" development within the framework of the "green transition" launched by Western states, while becoming a unifying power for the Third World countries in this direction. In practice, the PRC's environmental policy, implemented through five-year development plans, has achieved notable success over the past two decades. The combination of caution with pragmatism and pedantry in the political and economic spheres strengthens China's leadership position in the world. The current political and energy global crisis, which at a deeper level reveals a struggle of ideological and cultural paradigms, the process of establishing a new world order, creates favorable conditions for the realization of the Chinese "ecological civilization" concept, since it contains a harmonizing principle contrary to the "aggressive" approach of man to nature, that has prevailed over the past few centuries and has caused a rough dissonance between the direction of human development and the environment.

AB The paper is aimed at investigating the recent trends of Britain's socio-cultural influence in the former USSR republics. The analysis covers London's major regional programmes, financing, mechanisms of influence, and implementing organisations. Subregional differentiation of political approaches is established. In Ukraine and Moldova sociocultural influence infrastructures are aimed at direct political influence as well as military and political struggle with Russia. In the South Caucasus London prioritises broadening influence in the interstate dialogue and conflicts as well as anti-Russian information campaigns with the aim of removing Russian military presence. In Central Asia Britain works on broadening regional footprint through technical and socio-economic programmes. The author concludes that preservation of limitrophe status of the former USSR republics constitutes merely one possible mode of British regional policy. The other mode consists of regional order revision which presupposes transition from strengthening a neutral status of post-Soviet states towards instrumentalising their dependencies on Britain's influence in the ongoing geopolitical contest with Russia. In the face of transition to a polycentric world order Britain's development assistance and influence programmes evolved in the direction of politicisation and weaponisation. Hence destabilisation risks for post-Soviet states increase. In the context of a "unipolar moment" London was interested in the development of post-Soviet space as a part of global periphery of the Western-centric international system, but not as a part of an alternative geoeconomic pole. Amid the transition to a polycentric world order British system of influence is increasingly coming into conflict with alternative poles hence proliferating destabilisation risks for the former USSR republics.

DT Article
DE Pakistan; International Monetary Fund; credits; investments
AB Pakistan has faced economic challenges in recent years amid rising global crude oil prices and hydrocarbon import bills: free fall of the rupee, high interest rates, elevated fiscal deficits, 37% inflation, falling stock market, and as a result - shrinking industrial production and elimination of social welfare spending. The borrowings from the IMF, China, and Gulf countries to restore foreign exchange reserves and lack of capability to return them convinced the military- civil authorities in 2023 to declare a threat to the country's economic sovereignty. The 2019 IMF financial assistance program approved the allocation of 6.5 billion USD until 2023. In 2023, the Fund approved an additional Stand- By Agreement in the amount of 3 billion USD. Basic requirements of the IMF included tightening of credit and financial policy; conducting reforms to improve budgetary discipline and broaden the tax base; reducing public debt; etc. The authorities took a number of urgent measures, first of all, they increased electricity tariffs and the amount of collected taxes. Pakistani society has been critical of the IMF's demands, especially the increases in electricity tariffs and cuts in social benefits, accusing the IMF of making Pakistan a victim of a debt trap, like many other developing countries. In 2020-2021, the five COVID-19 pandemic waves in Pakistan and then the devastating flood in the country made the situation even more complicated. Challenges in the economy were aggravated by the fierce internal struggle of political opponents. The economic reforms carried out by the three subsequent governments in 2018-2022, headed by prime ministers Imran Khan, Shehbaz Sharif, and Anwaar Haq Kakar, were inconsistent and contradictory, which provoked criticism on the part of the IMF.

TI Development or self-destruction? Evald Ilyenkov vs. Slavoj Žižek on the
   problem of radical negativity
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
LA English
DT Article
DE Dialectics; Ilyenkov; Totality; Radical negativity; Fractal; & Zcaron;i
   & zcaron;ek
AB The article presents a theoretical analysis of the extramural polemic between Slavoj & Zcaron;i & zcaron;ek and Evald Ilyenkov, undertaken in the context of the search for the foundational underpinnings of the two philosophers' perspectives on the limit-logical definitions of being. It shows how this apparently "abstract" search grows out of the socio-historical circumstances of the thinkers' lives, which are inscribed in the dramatic conditions of existence of the political events of the twentieth century. The active life-political position of the follower of Marx's ideas, figuratively expressed in the text by Lenin's term "tactics of social democracy" (Lenin 1962), is justified by one or another cognitive position: the unified attitude "not to explain but to transform the world" breaks down into various "tactics" precisely in the attempt to solve the problem of radical negativity (as & Zcaron;i & zcaron;ek formulates it). This is expressed in the division of Marxism into "Western" and "Eastern". This article analyzes the legitimacy of such a division and shows the conditions for a disintegration of the divide. The relation of Ilyenkov and & Zcaron;i & zcaron;ek to Hegel's works turns out to be the key to understanding this division, and consequently to the essential difference in socio-political attitudes and "tactics", of which they are creative representatives. The analysis leads to the formulation of the "germ cell" of disagreement between Ilyenkov and & Zcaron;i & zcaron;ek-the problem of the universal-which unfolds in the difference between the thinkers' positions on certain theoretical points. The limitation of Ilyenkov's position, established under the fire of & Zcaron;i & zcaron;ek's criticism, is removed, according to the author, by the development of a new category of "fractality", which acts as a counterpart to the main dialectical category of "totality" and provides a concrete (in the Hegelian sense) solution to the problem of radical negativity in the spirit of the classical philosophical tradition.

TI Judicialization of Global Climate Governance: In Defence of the Paris
   Agreement
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW

DT Editorial Material
AB This article questions the effect that the delegation of global climate governance to the international judiciary may have on climate action. It argues that the underlying premise of the judicialization movement-namely, the existence of a broad international consensus as to the objectives of global climate change risk management-is contradicted by evidence, such as political declarations by governments, countries' nationally determined contributions, and domestic court judgments. Governments brought to court resist propositions that domestic or international legal norms subject them to quantitative emission reduction obligations that can be "objectively" determined on the basis of best available science, and national judiciaries make conflicting findings on the implications of science for climate policy. In this context, renouncement of the "bottom-up" Paris model which was designed specifically to address the complex landscape of diverse interests and risk perceptions across world regions and societies may have a chilling, rather than galvanizing, effect on climate action.

ID TRANSFORMATION
AB Although many scientific works are devoted to the phenomenon of populism, the problem of studying sociopolitical processes and practices that develop against the background of the rise of populist parties to government is still relevant. Of particular interest is the way in which "populism in power" affects the transformation of populist parties from within, as well as the state of society, dissatisfied with the unwillingness of populist parties to immediately fulfill all the promises made by leaders on the way to power. Analyzing the 30-year experience of populism in Italy and the stay of populists in power over the past five years (2018-2024), the author of this article concludes that: (1) parties that positioned themselves as political alternative parties and criticized representative democracy, traditional parties, and the political class have not actualized the promised innovations-new forms of democracy and participation; greater involvement of citizens in politics; and new practices, including intraparty ones; (2) the disappointment of society with the ideological transformism of populist parties, unfulfilled promises, and "conciliatory" policies towards mainstream parties may contribute to a further increase in distrust of political parties as an institution and to a rejection of political action in favor of a different repertoire-direct social action, which ensures a horizontal type of trust and the solution of socioeconomic problems in the short term through grassroots social interaction. Direct social action becomes an alternative to the manifestation of political protest and other types of political action. Society is depoliticized, while horizontal integration is strengthened, implying direct social action, which has a latent protest character and can be politicized in the future. This article contributes to the discussion on the evolution of the phenomenon of populism and its sociopolitical consequences.

AB The author considers the problems of the relationship between the multi-level authorities and management, and the center and national autonomies in the RSFSR, as among the most complex hierarchical arrangement of the USSR. The author reveals the place and significance of the so-called private meeting of national workers (November 1926) and the discussion of its results on the ground in solving the key issues of nation-building and Soviet modernization of the multi-ethnic country. The research is based on the published materials, as well as archival documents related to the meeting in Moscow in November 1926 and its discussion in: the autonomies (the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History (F. 17 - the Central Committee of the Russian communist party of the Bollic of Kazakhstan (F. 141 - the Kazakh Regional Committee of the Russian communist party of the Bolsheviks - All-Union Communist Party), and the State Archive of the Russian Federation (F. 3316 - Central Executive Committee of the USSR). The author concludes that the federal construction was accompanied by intense search for balance between state bodies, and the discussions between representatives of the center and autonomies concerned: the determination of the status of the autonomies, the adjustment of the management mechanism, the distribution of powers and interaction of all-Russian and autonomist structures, the role of the center and ethno-political elites in the implementation of the tasks of ethno-national policy, and the strengthening of statehood.

ID BALANCE
AB The formation of a geopolitical triangle between the U.S., PRC and Russia is becoming the main driving factor shaping the strategic landscape. This raises several key questions for researchers. It is necessary to clarify the peculiarities of the "tripolar" world order from the military-strategic point of view and identify innovations it brings to the existing methodological corpus of studying and maintaining strategic stability. The dynamics of contradictions in this system is complex, characterized by multiple variants of transformation into a more or less stable system, which will form the basis of the emerging multilateral world order. The three main players can enter into different relationship models and change them as the situation evolves. The military-strategic dimension of trilateral interaction has already significantly changed views on the operating factors and the essence of strategic stability compared to the way it was understood at the end of the Cold War. The situation is seen as far less stable than in the bipolar model of confrontation which was realized during the Cold War. It is necessary to rebuild the system of risk reduction measures, including declarative ones. However, it seems clear that such a process could only develop sustainably in parallel with a broad- based process of international political d & eacute;tente. This will require all parties to the process to manage the acute phase of the crisis around Ukraine, creating grounds for revising the foundation of strategic relations in Europe following the principles of equal and indivisible security. At the same time, a comprehensive regional security system in the IndoPacific will be needed that can effectively address the most pressing issues of U.S. - China contest there. Despite the fact that relations in the triangle are currently in an acute phase of confrontation, conclusions should already be drawn about the practical forms of realizing the notions of strategic stability through arms control measures.

AB As a head of IMEMO, the Academician Alexandr Dynkin focused on forecasting the main directions of world development - in the economy, ideological, social and political spheres, as well as in the field of international security. The Institute prepared both annual and long-term (15-20 years) forecasts, which have been published since 2008 under the general title "Russia and the World". This large prognostic project was headed by Alexandr Dynkin and Vladimir Baranovskii. The IMEMO analysts concentrated on issues of key importance for ensuring Russia's stable economic development. The annual forecasts identified and traced main trends in the economies of the U.S., Europe, Japan, China, India, Russia and the world as a whole. The conjuncture of the most important markets for Russian exports was predicted. These annual publications presented an analysis and prognosis of developments of in international relations, investigated the main external challenges for Russia, and proposed options for response. In the forecast up to 2030, prepared in 2008, the researchers analyzed the development dynamics of key subjects, structures and institutions of international relations, the most likely models of their interaction, the emerging principles and mechanisms of global governance. In parallel with the forecasts, the Institute regularly prepared analytical materials and recommendations for the central government bodies of the Russian Federation. The most important results of the Institute's work were included in the annual reports of the Russian Academy of Sciences submitted to the President and the Government of Russia. In general, the first "five-year period" of Alexandr Dynkin's directorship (2007-2011) was marked by a number of important scientific achievements of IMEMO. By the beginning of the 2010s, the Institute had not only restored, but also significantly strengthened its position as the leading think tank in Russia in the study of the modern world development problems. In October 2011, the IMEMO research team re-elected the Academician Alexandr Dynkin as a Director of the Institute for a second five-year term.

AB The article examines the stages of formation of foreign policy consensus in Spain in the post-Franco period. Over the course of almost half a century, this consensus was violated only twice: the first time, when the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) government that came to power in 1982 held a referendum on Spain's membership in NATO, and the second time, when in 2003, Aznar's conservative government, contrary to public opinion, supported the intervention of American troops into Iraq. In Spain, a consensus exists on the main directions of foreign policy: European policy; security and defense policy, including NATO; the importance of the Mediterranean region, including the Maghreb; Latin America, and the fundamental role of the UN. Foreign policy as a government policy requires the highest degree of consensus because in this way it gains stability, predictability and authority. On July 23, 2023, parliamentary elections were held in Spain. According to their results, four national parties are represented in the Congress of Deputies: PSOE, the People's Party (PP), the left-wing SUMAR, and the ultra-right Vox. The paper investigates the foreign policy attitudes of these parties, which will determine Spain's foreign policy in the current legislature. Primary attention is paid to security issues. The author empathizes the proximity or coincidence of the foreign policy guidelines of the PSOE, PP and SUMAR regarding major issues. This imparts the foreign policy consensus a truly state character. Separately, the foreign policy attitudes of the ultra-right Vox are analyzed, these losing their original radicalism, although aggressive rhetoric remains. In general, it is difficult for the weak government of Sanchez to develop foreign policy for the medium and especially long term, therefore, short-term interests will continue to prevail, and the influence of domestic policy on foreign policy will remain decisive. At the same time, responsibility for building Spanish foreign policy lies with both the government and the main opposition party. Such a policy, based on international law and multilateralism, is for a medium-sized country like Spain the minimum guarantee of independence from major powers.

Most of the letters are in the personal archive of Sholokhov's family. The phenomenon of fan mail developed in Russia in the early 1870s. It became particularly widespread in the Soviet period due to a number of cultural initiatives in the early years of Soviet power. Letters to Sholokhov appear not so much as signs of his reputation, but as material for the study of the Soviet reader and his era. This is especially evident in the letters included in the second volume: they were written from 1956 until the end of the writer's life. At this time, people wrote to Sholokhov not only the writer, but also the deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Materials from different years clarify the general cultural, political and literary context of these letters. The compilers distinguished groups of letters to Sholokhov by subject matter: letters from readers of the USSR, foreign readers, and representatives of emigration; letters from novice writers; letters to Sholokhov as a public figure; letters from participants in World War II; letters from prisoners; and requests for material assistance. The main topics include requests to send books, autographs, photographs, to tell about the fate of heroes (primarily Grigory Melekhov); appeals for help in solving private and public problems; complaints about the lack of books in libraries, bookstores and at private sellers. Chronologically and compositionally, the letters caused by Sholokhov's speech at the 20th Congress of the CPSU on the problems s of literary creativity and the work of the Writers' Union are singled out. The awarding of the Nobel Prize to Sholokhov in 1965 caused a reaction of readers. Letters with negative reviews either did not survive in the archives or were not included in the edition. In general, the letters to Sholokhov appear as a subject of general interest of the humanities in collecting, preserving, and publishing documents that reflect the perception of contemporaries of an event or phenomenon. They could become the material for history of reading in Russia. For this purpose, at the first stage, it is necessary to create digital copies of the letters, do their markup and statistical processing according to the main parameters: the letter's author, date, address, and topic. . The next stage could be the correlation of the results obtained with data on letters to other writers. A thematic index could be the first step in this direction and, at the same time, a help in using the existing edition.

AB The Cold War was replaced by the postbipolar world, which is morphing into polycentricity (multipolarity). With all uncertainty of its final parameters and structural pillars, we can assert that the features of the current stage of international relations are selective deglobalization and a new round of major powers' competition. In the 21st century, centrifugal forces have proved to be stronger than necessity of consolidation in the face of universal challenges: international terrorism, climate change, pandemics, etc. Apart from economic and political contradictions, as well as opposite interpretations of national security interests, the sphere of competition of values has emerged and is going through structuring. The task of this research is to determine if value narratives and accompanying ideologies are causes or consequences of escalation of tensions in the Russia-USA-EU triangle. The author compares the role of value antagonisms at the current stage and in the period of the Soviet-American clash of capitalism and socialism paradigms. It is demonstrated that the geopolitical competition's resumption is caused not by incompatibility of certain socioeconomic models but by the struggle for leadership in the system of global governance and regulation. During this struggle, the value discourse, which has objective foundation, with time is exposed to profound securitization and geopolitization, leading to the construction of antagonisms: democracies-autocracies and pseudovalues-traditional values. It is noted that in case of hypertrophied usage the values' differences, with all their objectivity, can evolve from the function of cultural interaction to a self-perpetuating factor of interstate contradictions, which hinders adequate assessment of national and foreign resources and potentials.

AB The changes in classical universities during the 20th century are studies in the context of high-profile political and socio-economic events. At the same time, there are no studies of the internal resources and prerequisites for these changes, of the disciplinary communities, that determined the trajectories of universities development. The article, based on materials from archival documentation, personal sources and periodicals, examines the dynamics of changes of the role and place of agglomeration physicists and mathematicians in the teaching staff and scientific life of one of the oldest universities in Russia, Tomsk University, during the Revolutionary and Soviet periods. The identified data considered in the all-Russian and all-Union context. Over the period from 1917 to the late 1940s the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics has gone from being not the most numerous and influential to one of the dominant structural divisions of Tomsk University. The growth of the faculty coincided with the renewal of the student and teaching staff, which took place under the conditions of a policy of class selection. In 1950s, there were practically no people left at the faculty who had received their education before 1917. The new generation, a significant part of which had a low social origin, came to the university with reprehensible perception of it as an elitist center. Largely thanks to the contribution of the physics and mathematics departments, Tomsk University in the 1940s-70s was actually the main training center for young Siberian universities, a source of personnel for industry and government agencies. The representatives of the new generation of university physicists and mathematicians integrated into the system of the Academy of Sciences (AS) of the Soviet Union - the Tomsk Scientific Center of the Siberian Branch of the AS created with their energetic participation. At the same time, they did not break their ties with the university. In the conditions of asymmetric competition between universities and the AS for scientific leadership, this strategy turned out to be advantageous, and the academy itself turned for the university from a dangerous competitor into a reliable ally. On the one hand, these scientists, brought up already in the Soviet era and endowed with certain social prejudices, were clearly not orthodox zealots of the traditions of classical universities. On the other hand, their participation in the scientific and pedagogical life of Tomsk University, paradoxically, largely determined the high competitiveness of the latter, the preservation of its high status and continuity with the pre-revolutionary era at a time when the prerequisites for this continuity were often insignificant.

AB This article analyzes one of the current problems of modern politics and political science known as "the crisis of democracy". The methodology of the study is based on system approach where a democratic political system is presented as a regulating system with feedback and inner stabilization contour. Under the system approach, the "crisis of democracy" is associated with dysfunction of political institutions of representative democracy that enable operation of the feedback channel - institution of elections and institution of political parties. The dysfunction of the feedback channel leads to problems with human resources and functional quality of the bodies of state power. The essence of these problems is that decisions taken by the authorities may not fully meet the needs and challenges of the dynamically changing social environment. In this context, the modern "crisis of democracy" can be viewed as a crisis of regulation of the social environment by the state authorities, which is caused by the crisis of legitimacy and effectiveness of decisions made by the authorities. The crisis of efficiency stems from a dysfunction of the highest bodies of state power, which are unable to make timely decisions and provide adequate responses to changes in the economic and political situation, international and domestic events. The crisis of efficiency leads to a decrease in the level of trust in political elites, political parties, the president and the government, which further triggers crises of political participation and representation and spirals into a crisis of legitimacy as involvement of citizens in the decision-making process. The key factor of the modern "crisis of democracy" is that under the conditions of post-industrial civilizational transit, political systems of the modern democratic states do not respond adequately to the transformation of the social environment into socio-informational environment, where social and info-communication processes are inextricably intertwined. The study shows that currently we are facing the "crisis of democracy" of transformational type, which is meant to stimulate the development and improvement of democratic political and state institutions and orders based on their adaptation to the new socio-informational environment.

AB This article is devoted to analysis of political and legal problems arising in the development of science and technology at the international and national levels in connection with geo-economic and geopolitical sanctions. The purpose of the work is to substantiate the approach to scientific and technological sanctions as barriers in international cooperation in the area of theoretical science and technology, which are of a political and legal nature. In the course of the analysis it was possible to prove the validity of singling out the category of scientific sanctions, which are selective, in contrast to political and economic sanctions that negatively affect the scientific and technological complex of specific states, but do not have a selective nature. The barriers that arise in the course of international scientific and scientific-technological cooperation are systematized. The nature of scientific sanctions has been established as barriers that have a strong-willed basis and are aimed at curtailing cooperation within the framework of certain organizational and legal forms. It has been established that the legal version of scientific sanctions is the unilateral termination of international contractual relations, as well as the adoption of decisions on the termination of ties by scientific and scientific-educational institutions that have the right to make autonomous decisions. The conclusions of this article are as follows: as a method to respond to sanction challenges in the field of STI, the formation and implementation of a special state policy aimed at providing legal support for special support for the R&D sector is occurring, as well as preserving the remaining scientific cases while developing and deepening alternative areas of international cooperation. This category of measures should not be perceived as a series of countermeasures that would lead to a further curtailment of ISTC, but as measures that should ensure its development, including in other geographical areas and based on the increased use of scientific diplomacy methods.

AB In the article, the author considers the issue of extracting criminally significant information from the content of Internet pages on social networks. In the course of the research, general scientific and private research methods were used; methods of formal and dialectical logic, the method of interpretation, etc. It is stated that social networks are widespread in the modern world and the majority of the world's population is involved in them. The article hypothesizes on the content of a wide range of criminally significant information on social networks and on specific user pages. The potential of using social networks for law enforcement purposes is considered and its active and passive components are stated. The use of social networks to encourage recipients to take certain actions is emphasized as an active component. The passive component consists in studying the information of the social network and further using it during the investigation. Both registration information and autobiographical information, as well as its changes, personal photographs and videos, notes, the social component of the page (circle of acquaintances, indication of relatives and degree of kinship, political views), life credo, etc. should be examined. It is indicated that the additional functionality of a page on social networks (primarily its media objects - marked videos, music, clips, individual photos, pictures, news and entire sites) may in itself be an offense (for example, for crimes of an extremist nature, discrediting a special military operation and the armed forces of the Russian Federation, the spread of pornography, drug propaganda, etc.). In addition, this information can contribute to the compilation of a psychological portrait and a psycho-profile of a person. Information related to external sources may also be found on the page. So, in some cases, according to the information published on the user's page, it is possible to conclude that a person has registered on certain sites, marketplaces, dating services, etc. The analysis identifies three main ways to study the content of a page on social networks: the first one using the account of the investigator or other persons; the second one with the login with the account data of the injured user; the third one with a request from the resource administration for access to the page under study. The article discusses in detail the features of using each method. As a conclusion, it is stated that: during the study of the content of the page, two additional factors must be taken into account: 1. publishing on the pages not the actual information of the author, but the one that makes it more interesting, will cause approval or other reaction; 2. it is possible that fake accounts created for both criminal and legitimate exist for more or less a or untrue.

AB Despite the crisis of democracy in contemporary Russia, civil society networks and voluntary political participation are rapidly developing. Russian people are increasingly attempting to express their political and social needs in their daily lives, rather than relying on traditional institutions of representation. This study asks what caused the vitalization of grassroots civic activities, but what are the limitations of those civic activities? This study explores the nature and dynamics of contemporary civic activities in Russia, focusing on the factors that have contributed to their growth and the limitations they face in the context of state interactions. The research employs expert survey data collected from 2014 to 2021 to analyze the trends and directions of voluntary initiative groups formed around diverse social agendas. The authors argue that the Internet has significantly influenced Russian civil society by increasing online civic activities and enabling the interconnection between online and offline protests. However, the impact and sustainability of these activities are constrained by state-initiated digital feedback platforms. This study contributes to the understanding of the conditions under which grassroots civic activities can thrive in complex political settings and the role of digital technologies in shaping civil society in Russia.

AB The study analyzes the stages and forms of the retum of Soviet socio-political practices to the Russian reality. The relevance of the research topic is conditioned by the increased role of the Soviet historical heritage in contemporary socio-political practice. The images associated with the Soviet period of Russian history are quite actively exploited by political and media discourse. The main research interest was focused on the social phenomenon of nostalgia, as well as the phenomenon of modern mythology. Accordingly, the theoretical basis of the study was an array of works by domestic and foreign authors devoted to the development of the problems of nostalgia, post-memory, archaic and modern mythology. The study identified several stages of actualization and return of Soviet socio-political practices in the Russian reality. In the 1990s, nostalgic sentiments about the Soviet past began to form in parallel with the official policy of desovietization. Present at the everyday level and realized in a reflexive version, they began to be actively exploited by the media environment. Starting from the 2000s, a gradual return of Soviet socio-political practices has been taking place in the form of a restorative type of nostalgia. This trend is clearly visible in the new state symbols and ceremonial, the system of titles and awards. Russia's growing confrontation with Western countries has created a situation similar to that of the Cold War and the Iron Curtain. Russia, like the Soviet Union, is once again becoming a state that opposes the "collective West". All this leads to a systematic return to the Soviet legacy in the form of political mythology, the central element of which is the victory in the Great Patriotic War and the transformation of the Soviet state into a superpower. This myth legitimizes the political ambitions of contemporary Russia, justifies its position and special historical mission. On the one hand, the return of the Soviet heritage and socio-political practices has constructive effects. The heroic myth of the Soviet past has a powerful consolidating and mobilizing potential. It is quite capable of playing the role of a national ideology. Moreover, the formation of a new Russian identity is impossible without the Soviet past. On the other hand, attempts to restore the Soviet past can have destructive effects. In the new realities, elements of the Soviet socio-political practice can become a brake on the country's development. Since in fact the image of the future is replaced by a mythologized and idealized image of the past.

For many years donor aid served as a key strategy utilized by wealthier nations to address the global disparities in developing world. Foreign aid was a source of financial resources for economic growth, infrastructure development and, social programs. However, in recent years, the nature of aid has shifted notably becoming an instrument with its far-reaching conditionality. Donor aid shapes policies in receiving states reflecting a more interventionist approach. Many scholars argue that donor aid paradoxically hinders recipient country<acute accent>s development causing dependency and this dependency is not only economic or financial but also political. The article draws parallels between the dependency theory and donor aid. The dependency theory emerging as opposed to modernity theory in the 1950th goaled to explain underdevelopment in Latin America has maintained its relevance nowadays and re-emerged in academic discourse. In the modern era, donor aid symbolizes the dependency of Global South on Global North. While aimed at poverty reduction and promotion of economic development in recipient nations, donor aid exacerbates issues such corruption, bad governance, mismanagement of natural resources, environmental degradation and constrains their sovereignty benefiting more donor countries rather than recipient ones. Through the cases of two poorest states in Central Asia - Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the article enlightens the relationship between the dependency theory and donor aid with the special attention paid to Chinese enormous grants and loans. The research demonstrates how these two nations, due to limited resources and economic challenges, have heavily become reliant on foreign aid which in some cases hinder their sovereignty, political and economic independence.

AB In the kaleidoscopic events of the current international politics, the destiny of the Russian-American Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (also known as the New START Treaty and in Russia - as the START-3 Treaty) has moved to the shadow of the world public opinion. In February 2021, the parties extended the New START Treaty by five years - until February 2026, and launched consultations in Geneva on strategic stability including the scope of the follow-on treaty. However, the U.S. interrupted this dialogue in February 2022 in reaction to the special military operation of Russia in Ukraine. Since then the Western states have been increasing their participation in the conflict by massive deliveries of arms and military equipment to Ukraine, as well as by applying unprecedented economic and political sanctions against Russia. On its part, Russia has declared suspension of participation in the New START Treaty on February 21, 2023 in response to the policy of the West, openly aimed at inflicting "the strategic defeat" on Russia, and for some other reasons. Under these conditions, the uncertain future of the New START Treaty and of the endurance of negotiations of the two nuclear superpowers is prone with the expanding crisis of the strategic stability and global security. Disintegration of this bearing construction would most probably trigger the collapse of other crucial agreements in this sphere: the ban on nuclear testing and prevention of nuclear proliferation, prohibition of deployment of nuclear arms in space and on the seabed. Without strategic arms control it would be impossible to expand the process of nuclear disarmament to the third nuclear-armed states and other kinds of weapons and disruptive military technologies.

   movements; institutional isomorphism; territorial
AB The political and territorial diversity management in the context of separatism risks requires the state to implement reforms, borrowing their recipes. Successful recipes in one case may lead to failure in the other. This point is expanded into two more specific questions. Why and who borrows recipes for political reforms and solutions and how do they do it? What role do imitation and coercion strategies play in this? Using the concept of P. DiMaggio and U. Powell on the convergence of institutional structures of organizations as a result of three isomorphic processes - coercion, normative borrowing, and imitation, the article compares successful and unsuccessful cases of reforms to resolve ethnopolitical conflicts (Montenegrin, Vojvodina, Kosovo, Presevo valley, and Sanjak) in the same ethnopolitical and politico-institutional space of Serbia and Montenegro. The comparison parameters are: the composition of conflicts in terms of actors involved, including third parties, the nature and content of requirements and institutional decisions taken in relation to them, as well as strategies for interaction and institutional decision-making. The political and institutional space of Serbia and Montenegro is a common organizational field, where the statuses of the regions are differentiated. This asymmetry is due to the historical experience of autonomous or republican status for Kosovo, Montenegro, Vojvodina and its absence for Sanjak and Presevo valley. Territorial division leads to potential irredentism, which can block the isomorphic effect of related coercive and imitative institutional reforms and inclusive ethnic policies that make the space homogeneous in terms of guarantees of rights, but differentiated in terms of political statuses. The coercive actions of Serbia and Montenegro are accompanied by similar coercion by the EU or UN. The response of subnational public authorities, politicians often turn out to be imitative, which ensures (except for the case of Kosovo) the blocking of separatist projects.

AB The article is devoted to the socio-political situation in Perm province during the period of the Supreme Ruler. The research is based on the documents of the fund R-746 of the State Archive of the Perm Region (GAPK) - "Manager of the Perm Province of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Provisional All-Russian Government", which were first introduced into scientific circulation. The Perm archive received the documents for secret storage in 1940 from the Sverdlovsk regional archive, and access to them was limited until 1994. Manuscripts and typewritten texts are reports of police chiefs, monthly statements of criminal offenses, correspondence of zemstvo employees with the Governor of the province. It is noteworthy that one of the documents mentions the name of General G. A. Verzhbitsky. Of greatest interest are the reports of district governors on the progress of mobilization and on the political mood of the population under the change of power. A tragedy was unfolding in the city of Perm and its districts in those days. The situation was aggravated by an epidemic of typhus spread by soldiers, inflation, the cessation of work of factories, mobilizations, and an influx of refugees. The lists of executed citizens compiled by the zemstvo clerks show that the Bolshevik terror fell at the end of December 1918, which was explained by the change in the military and political situation on the Eastern Front. Paradoxically, the thesis about the temporary failures of the Red Army and the surrender of Perm looks quite plausible, in the sense that it was not a "catastrophe" of the entire Eastern Front, since we cannot speak about the stability of the Supreme Ruler's power in the province. On the other hand, the situation in the first half of 1919 was truly catastrophic. The discovered archival documents contain information sufficient to assert that during the period in question the local residents did not experience any relief from the hardships of the Civil War, despite the titanic efforts of zemstvo employees to restore order. The aim of the paper is to show the socio-political situation in Perm province by the example of previously unpublished archival documents. The object of the study is local self-government bodies, county and volost zemstvos, town militia, the subject is the realities of socio-political life after December 1918. The main methods of the study were the problem-chronological and comparative-historical. Both methods and sources cited by the author allowed to restore the sequence of events after December 1918 and to analyze the attitude of the population to the change of power.

ID GREAT TERROR
AB In the article the author, based on the analysis of materials of the newspaper "For Pedagogical Cadres" of Kazan State Pedagogical Institute (KSPI), reveals the role of the university press in the transformation of the system of traditional values in the scientific and educational environment during the mass repressions of the 1930s. Being the main mechanism of manipulation of mass consciousness, the university newspaper promoted the popularization of the campaign of self-criticism; instilling an atmosphere of fear and suspicion, forced to admit guilt for imperfect mistakes. The choice of the object of the study is conditioned by the fact that in the 1930s KSPI was the only university in the Volga region, where historians and social scientists were trained. Its staff was represented by highly qualified specialists of the pre-revolutionary old school and graduates of metropolitan universities. The new wave of political repressions, which began after the assassination of S. M. Kirov in 1934, was unfolding here. Meanwhile, in the studies devoted to the formation and development of KSPI, the period of mass repressions is glossed over, and many aspects concerning the organization of scientific and educational process under Stalinism, quantitative and qualitative indicators of victims of repressions, chronology of events, still remain unreported in the scientific literature. The author, relying on the materials of the periodical press, found that initially the newspaper "For Pedagogical Cadres" was aimed at covering party life, academic work, and the everyday life of students, but very soon it turned into a tool of political struggle between students and teachers, while whistleblowing in the institute acquired a new - open form. In the study, when working with historical sources, the methodology of phenomenological hermeneutics was used, which allowed to restore the sequence of events in KSPI, associated with the period of mass repression in the 1930s, to explain the motives of student denunciations and the reasons for conciliatory behavior of teachers, taking into account the peculiarities of their worldview, socio-economic, political and ideological conditions of life. The analysis of university press publications and archival materials made it possible to trace the moment of fracture and deformation of former moral values, accepted forms of corporate ethics and relations between teachers and students. Under the influence of the changing political and ideological situation, the participants of the events were forced to adjust their views and assessments of reality, to bring them in line with new social requirements and expectations.

AB The issues of creating a more equitable global monetary and financial system have been constantly in the focus of the BRIC countries since 2006. Gradual introduction of unprecedented restrictive measures against one of the participants - Russia - forced member states to intensify the work on diminishing their dependence on actions of the United States, searching for alternative ways of payment for goods and services and reducing transactions in US dollars. The article analyses prerequisites for development of monetary cooperation within BRICS and implications of the measures already taken in this direction. The extent to which introduction of a common currency can contribute or, on the contrary, create barriers to deepening economic integration within BRICS is explored. The experience of introducing euro in the EU shows that the decision on joining a common currency is not just an economic, but also a political one. Ignoring the risks associated with a radical change in payment systems can lead to serious disruptions in the world economy and push exporters and importers away from implementation of agreements reached at the highest level. The authors come to the conclusion that speeding up currency cooperation without relying on comprehensive consideration of the interests of BRICS countries and assessment of potential costs and benefits can lead to deterioration of the terms of mutual trade against the backdrop of the US attempts to maintain the existing architecture of global monetary system with absolute domination of the US dollar.

DE labor market; informal employment; global indicators; social
   composition; influence of education
AB The share of informal employment in the world is almost 60% of all employment in the labor market. The informal sector is an important part of the economy, especially in low-income countries with high rates of population growth low urbanization. The informal sector creates jobs, providing income for more than two billion people worldwide. In difficult circumstances, the informally employed (NFE) are precisely those people who are willing to do lower quality work, which does not guarantee them social protection, labor rights, and decent working conditions. Widespread informal employment in all its forms entails adverse consequences of various kinds for workers, enterprises, and society as a whole. For example, informal economic units tend to have low productivity and lack access to financial resources, which creates barriers to decent work and sustainable development. This article highlights the objectively existing conditions and features of development in different parts of the world, assessing their impact on the social composition and the number of participants in informal labor relations. At the same time, it shows the unambiguous position of the international community, which is the leitmotif of all documents of the UN, ILO, IMF, OECD - providing decent work and social protection to all informal workers. The factor of education in employment depends most of all on the political will of both the global community and the leadership of a particular country, therefore it can be influenced, unlike the prevailing economic conditions. Education creates human potential, contributes to the development of the country and, as will be shown in the article, affects the number of informal employ & iecy;& iecy;s. The level of education is closely connected with the level of informal employment in all regions.

DE strategy; Romania; foreign policy; USA; defense planning; Russia; armed

AB This paper deals with the issue of the growing military-strategic partnership between Romania and the United States, and addresses its effects on the post-Soviet countries. After 2022, the U.S. has become increasingly interested in the Danubian theater of operations, deploying a sizeable contingent of American ground troops in Romania. Making use of its partnership with the Americans, and inspired by the successful example of Poland, the Romanian government started to modernize its national armed forces after years oftechnological stagnation. One can reasonably assume that the consequences of this policy could affect Moldova and Transnistria, shifting the regional balance of power in a direction unfavorable to Russia. At the present stage, however, the U.S. - authorized infusion of relatively modern Western weapons into the Romanian army is primarily aimed at offsetting the technological gap, which had formed during the Cold War years and intensified in the 1990s-2000s. The events of the 2022 Ukrainian crisis presented Bucharest with a chance to strengthen its position within the United States' strategic framework and, as a result, dramatically expanded the scope of its military and technical partnership with Washington. The Romanian leadership seems eager to capitalize on the growing American interest in the rapid and lasting takeover of the Danube theater of operations. It cannot be ruled out that this trend will affect Moldova, which maintains close political ties with Romania. The American base of operations has not shifted to Eastern Europe so far. The rear logistics command of the U.S. European Command remains in the same location it was originally established during the Cold War. The forces deployed as part of the Operation Atlantic Resolve have only slightly advanced closer to the conflict zone. That said, the experience of the Cold War and, more specifically, the deployment of American forces to provide cover for West Germany and South Korea suggests that, in order to effectively deter a would-be adversary, the rear base of operations must be located inside the confines of the potential combat theater, not outside of it. The current deployment of U.S. troops, therefore, appears to be an act of politics rather than strategy. In the eyes of Eastern European leaders, even a marginal, purely symbolic United States' military presence acts as a psychologically significant form of assurance against a hypothetical escalation vis-& agrave;-vis Moscow. At the same time, the American deployment in Eastern Europe resembles a "sanitary cordon" rather than an "iron curtain" in the sense that it is motivated more by political considerations than by strategic concerns. The fact that the recent U.S. military preparations are purely demonstrative in nature, as opposed to establishing a full-scale logistics command in a potential combat theater, means that Russia can continue to respond with similar symbolic gestures and warning signals.

DT Article
DE energy transition; institutional environment; sustainable energy;
   sustainable development; renewable energy sources
AB The world has experienced three energy transitions, which were accompanied by large-scale institutional changes that determined global energy development trends. As in previous cases, the current energy transition, defined as the shift to sustainable energy, is accompanied by significant changes in the institutional environment. The fourth energy transition, unlike previous ones, which were the result of a combination of objective factors, is a kind of global experiment. The governments of Western countries have done voluntary changes in the global institutional environment in order to create a certain track of change in the global energy industry. The launch of the fourth energy transition could not take place without legal and financial support for energy projects that met the principles of sustainable development. Nevertheless, the next institutional changes, that increase the likelihood that the transformation process in the global energy sector will become a self-sustaining process, have taken place. A global public narrative has appeared, describing in a concise, simplified and emotionally charged form the need for sustainable energy, the mechanisms for achieving it and the factors hindering its development. The narrative leads to stabilization of the transition through influencing on the political decision-making process and supporting self-sustaining replication mechanisms. The narrative makes the practice of corporate social responsibility activities compulsory for large energy companies. Another trend that has emerged in the current energy transition is the shift from centralized to network organizational structure of local energy systems. The network organizational structure of energy systems, supported not only by the spatial dispersion of a larger number of energy facilities, but also by the increased diversification of the types of facilities, leads to the formation of global homogeneity and local differentiation. Identified changes in the global institutional environment make a significant impact on the dynamics of the development of local energy systems and create stable trends that could proceed independently of the still significant government support.

AB The principal investigative goal of the present research is aimed at revealing the parameters and main directions of political and economic interaction between the Arabian monarchies and post-Soviet Central Asia (CA). The analysis takes into account the cardinal changes in the world system, where the formation of a polycentric world order is in full swing against the background of rejection of the monopolar model of world development. The place of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf in this order is determined by their increased foreign policy ambitions, supported by super-profits from the sale of oil and gas. The article also addresses an important issue of perception of the wealthy Arabian monarchies and their regional association, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), in Central Asia as a rather attractive foreign policy alternative. The Arab states of the Persian Gulf are currently intensifying their interaction with the Central Asian region, which offers them considerable opportunities in political, trade, and economic spheres. The interest of the Arabian monarchies, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, in Central Asia is also in line with their intentions to establish themselves as an independent geopolitical center. In turn, Central Asian countries hope to accelerate their economic modernization with the help of Arab investment and to broaden the horizons of international cooperation through interaction with the GCC. The Central Asian countries also do not give up hopes for the inflow of Arab investments, which are so essential to their development. In the context of growing geopolitical turbulence and a competitive environment, post-Soviet Central Asia opens up new horizons of international cooperation.

DE China; foreign policy; domestic policy; economy
AB The most important event in the China-U.S. relations at the end of 2023 was the meeting of Xi Jinping and J. Biden in San Francisco on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in November 2023. The meeting did not become a breakthrough in relations between the two countries, but it created the foundations for establishing cooperation in mutually beneficial areas. Agreements were reached on the restoration of military contacts, the resumption of activities of working groups on economic and financial cooperation, the development of cooperation in the fields of artificial intelligence, green economy, climate change, etc. At the same time, many economic and political issues remained unresolved: American trade and economic sanctions against China, and, most importantly, disagreements over Taiwan. Against the background of the China-U.S. Summit, Beijing policy has strengthened its two-vector nature. Before the Summit in the United States, a Sino-Russian Summit was held in Beijing in October 2023. Later, in December 2023, the China-EU Summit took place. Their results are contradictory. Xi described Sino-Russian relations as "healthy and stable". The Summit with the EU ended almost to no avail. An important foreign policy move made by Beijing was the Belt and Road Summit of October 2023, at which Chinese plans to institutionalize this strategy were announced, including the creation of the Belt and Road secretariat and "other institutions", supported with 100 bln U.S. dollars injections. In domestic politics, Xi's authoritarianism continued to strengthen, accompanied by restrictions on the freedom of speech. In the economy, China kept the GDP growth rate for 2023 in the desired range from 5 to 5.5%. The main task for Beijing in the field of economics for 2024 is at least to keep the growth rate of the national GDP at about 5%.

AB The article analyzes how the Soviet leadership pursued foreign policy objectives in relation to Turkey and the resulting legacy from these pursuits in today's terms. USSR-Turkey relations in the 1920s were based on the common political interests of the two states, both of which existed in a similar geopolitical environment. The common goal shared by both nations was to overcome international isolation and ensure national security. The view of the Soviet government on Turkey's role in border safety matters was outlined by People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Georgy Chicherin, who considered USSR-Turkey cooperation a tool for ensuring security of the southern and southwestern borders of the Soviet Union. The Black Sea Straits were a key issue in bilateral relations. As the Straits were considered a "gateway" for an attack on the USSR's southern borders, the Soviet government tried to revise the Straits regime in a more favorable way. It was assumed that strong economic ties with the Soviet Union and mutually advantageous cooperation in the security sector would become a robust deterrent instrument for Turkey's leaders. During the Great Patriotic War, the USSR's policies towards Turkey were aimed at preventing it from participating in the war on the side of a hostile bloc, as well as revamping the 1936 Montreux Convention more favorably for Soviet leadership. The 1939-1946 attempts to apply pressure on Turkey regarding the Straits issue caused the latter to withdraw from the orbit of Soviet influence and led to almost two decades of hostility and strained relations between the two nations. After the death of Joseph Stalin, particularly in the Khrushchev era, the Soviet government sought to improve bilateral relations, mainly by identifying common ground in military and political spheres, expanding trade and economic cooperation, and building the foundation for the current high level of bilateral Russia-Turkey relations.

DT Article
DE Europe; Japan; Unequal Treaties; Tokugawa Shogunate; Yokohama; trade
AB "Bakumatsu" is the period from 1853 to 1868, which can be translated as "The End of the Bakufu" or "The End of the Tokugawa Shogunate". Japan, under pressure from the United States and European countries, was forced to open the country for trade and contacts, well realising that it could not resist foreigners due to its technological and military inferiority. The "opening" of the country took place under the confu sion of the authorities and with the resistance of not only a large part of the authorities, but also the people, who readily rallied under easy understandable slogan of "honor emperor and expel barbarians" (sonno-joi). This led to military clashes between Japanese and foreigners and to acts of terrorism not only against "barbarians" but also against local supporters of the opening of the country. The result of the "opening" of the country was also the elimination of the traditional for Japan formal dual power, under which the power by law belonged to the Emperors in Kyoto, but the country was ruled by the military rulers - Shogunate of the Tokugawa dynasty in Edo. In 1868, the Tokugawa shogunate was abolished and power passed to the 122nd Meiji Emperor. The capital was moved to Edo and named Tokyo (Eastern Capital). Although the USA was given primacy in "opening" Japan, the major role in its political and economic transformation was played by European countries. President Millard Filmore, who initiated Matthew Perry's expeditions to Japan, was not re-elected, and the new president Franklin Pierce (1804-1874), was mainly preoccupied with the conflict between the American South and North, and did not pay much attention to the issue of relations with Japan. In 1861, the American Civil War broke out and European countries - Great Britain, France, the Netherlands and Russia - began to play a major role in Japan's foreign policy.

AB The article analyses the process of decision-making to regulate platform work in the European Union. The author underlines that the EU strived to introduce legal certainty and improve the working conditions of platform workers. Despite the fact that many platform workers are classified as self-employed, their status remains unclear, since it is often difficult to distinguish between real and bogus self-employment, which the employer uses to evade social payments. There are two key principles of the new directive: it allows to determine correctly the status of people working on digital platforms, and sets rules for the use of algorithmic systems in the workplace. At the same time, the conclusion is drawn that the difference in approaches among member states, political groups of the European Parliament, and EU institutions turns the regulation of platform employment into the most controversial EU files, resulting in the adoption of compromise legislation on minimum standards.

   of nature"; "letters to power"; T.D. Lysenko; M.N. Markov; USSR
AB The article is devoted to the consideration of the problems of ideologization of biological and agricultural science through the prism of studying the social consciousness of the era, which was determined by ideas about the relationship of social and biological processes. In the research literature, the ideologization of science is traditionally associated with the activities of academician T.D. Lysenko, whose research, scientific implementation and practical work was "adapted" to the Soviet principles of organizing society. The theory of natural selection was transformed into the concept of "re-education" of varieties in crop production and breeds in livestock production by "environmental conditions". The recognition of the external environment as "the primary source of changes in the heredity of organisms," transferred to the social soil, meant the possibility of educating a new, Soviet, person, a bearer of collectivist values. The Marxist postulate about the masses as the driving force of the historical process in relation to the organizational and scientific sphere was "supplemented" by ideas about mass collective farm experimentation as an important structural element of the scientific and experimental network, and in relation to scientific implementation - ideas about "mass production experiment". " However, the introduction of new documents into scientific circulation made it possible to establish that the ideologization of biology was not limited only to supporters of academician T.D. Lysenko, but was an integral part of the worldview of socialist-minded citizens, often not professionally associated with biological science. In a letter from the humanist M.N. Markov to N.S. Khrushchev, sent to the Soviet leader in 1954, outlined a "new theory of the development of nature," according to the author of the letter, more appropriate in comparison with the constructions of T.D. Lysenko, Soviet collectivist realities. The basis for the development of nature M.N. Markov defined the species as a tribal community, not an individual, which, in his opinion, was more consistent with the Marxist position that the creator of the history of human society was peoples, collectives, and not individuals. Lysenko was sharply criticized by the author of the letter for only "modernizing" Darwinism, while it was necessary to decisively break with it as a reactionary bourgeois theory that transferred the relations of domination and competition in society to the life of nature. The author comes to the conclusion that biological "theories", attractive from a political point of view, but scientifically untenable, resulted in the disorganization of both scientific and implementation activities, and "programmed" many errors and misconceptions.

DE Revolutionary violence; Soviet holidays; commemoration practices;
   historical memory; Penza Province
AB Based on the analysis of office documentation and materials of the periodical press, the article examines the functional features of the organization and conduct of the first mass festivals in revolutionary Russia. The relevance of the study is determined by the acceleration of the dynamics of memorial culture in the conditions of the spread of information technologies and digitalization of society. In this regard, the study of the regularities and specifics of the formation of collective memories and corresponding models of behavior in the era of the 1917 Revolution is of particular importance for solving the problems of modern memorial policy and the preservation of historical memory. The aim of the study is to analyze the socio-cultural content of commemorative practices in the conditions of the collapse of statehood and escalation of revolutionary violence in the Russian provinces. The source base is represented by the materials of the State Archive of Penza Oblast. The methodological tools are developed on the basis of the approaches of the history of everyday life, social constructionism and the history of memory. The sociocultural content of the mass political celebration is considered as the interaction of political, recreational and archetypal elements, which ensured the success of social adaptation and perception of new values and meanings. The political context of the celebrations and the representation of the new power were manifested in the idea of the world revolution, embodied in the red decor of public space, in the models of monuments to the founders of the revolutionary movement, in the organization of rallies, processions and military parades. Recreational resources (holding free concerts, performances, giving treats to children, etc.) were responsible for mnemic processes - remembering (imprinting) and preserving the historical memory of the events of the revolution. The archetypal purpose of the holidays of the first revolutionary year is connected with the desire to limit, to subject to oblivion the mass deviations of the revolutionary era. In Penza Province, unlike the metropolitan regions, the transformation of commemorative practices was dominated by the archetypal trajectory, which is explained by the specifics of historical development. The focus of the spatial organization of the "place of memory" was the administrative center of Penza - Sovetskaya (former Sobornaya) Square. A memorial to K. Marx was erected here on the eve of May Day celebrations, and fierce battles took place here during the rebellion of the Czechoslovak Corps (May 28-29, 1918). The funerals of the victims of the revolution and the appearance of the necropolis on the square created a new event frame of collective memories, designed to curb violence and chaos, to overcome the state of archetypal celebration. During the celebration of the first anniversary of the October Revolution in Penza, the worship of mass graves was complemented by the organization of a carnival procession and fireworks, which again points to the multilevel functionality of mass political events.

AB This paper is a source study of a circular postal telegram on the need to purge "politically unreliable" and "harmful" persons from the organizations and institutions of communication in Siberia. The document was sent to the heads of the Siberian regional subdivisions of the OGPU bodies, the management of organizations and communication institutions in Siberia in the second half of August 1928. The published source makes it possible to reveal the procedure of "getting rid" of "former people" and other persons who were seen as unreliable for the communist state from the point of view of the Soviet state security agencies. Based on the study of the postal telegram stored in the State Archive of the Novosibirsk Region, it is substantiated that, despite its interdepartmental nature, the document was prepared by the officers of the OGPU for Siberian Krai, who were responsible for ensuring the security of strategically important for the state communications agencies and the implementation of state policy with regard to "former people" and other unreliable persons. The theoretical basis of the work is represented by a combination of source and system methods. The source study method allowed us to study the published document in connection with the peculiarities of the era that caused its emergence. The system method allowed us to consider the document as a product of the political regime in the USSR, which increasingly ignored the existing legislation and gradually expanded the practice and scale of political repression. The study determines the scientific significance of the published historical source; according to the authors, it consists in the fact that the postal telegram sheds light on significant aspects of the history of the Soviet state and its socio-political life in that period. First of all, the source testifies to the forms and methods of work of the Soviet secret services, which were a special part of the party apparatus in the late 1920s, already confidently dictating their rules of conduct to representatives of Soviet organizations and institutions. In addition, this document demonstrates the process of degradation of Soviet law enforcement practice, which was caused by the activities of officials described in the document, this and similar instructions that created a system of ignoring the current legislation by the party-state apparatus and special services. The work may be of interest to researchers studying, first of all, the Soviet society of the Stalinist era, personnel purges, the activities of the Soviet security services and the existence of "former people" in the USSR.

AB Based on the analysis of documents stored in the fonds of the former archives of the Vologda and Arkhangelsk regional committees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) (now included in the collections of the regional state archives), the article examines the socalled << Rusangloles case >> - the abuse of the << mixed >> (Russian-English) joint-stock company, which was given forestry in Nikolsky uyezd of NorthDvinsky province for exploitation on concession basis. Taking advantage of their position being the only employer for the peasant population of the uyezd, the concessionaires violated the terms of the contract concluded with the USSR government, as well as Soviet laws on forest management and basic articles of the Labor Code. They were assisted in covering up these violations by representatives of the district and volost authorities, who received << gifts >> from the concessionaires in the form of scarce food and goods, which were given to them for free or at a reduced cost. As a result, reports were sent to the provincial economic and soviet bodies, and from there to the Main Concession Committee under the Council of People's Commissars. Those reports presented the activities of the concession enterprises in a favorable light. Critical speeches of peasant delegat'es at Soviet and Party congresses were not always taken into account, since loggers and rafters were classified as well-to-do peasants and even kulaks. Information about the true state of affairs at the logging sites came from communists, workers of the county party committees. The Party commission sent by the provincial committee, despite the opposition to its work, including from the state timber trust Severoles (under which the Rusangloles concession was created), conducted a thorough investigation, using various sources, including agent data, interviews with peasants and on-site inspection of the concession territory. The picture revealed was at variance with the reports sent to the Main Concession Committee under the Council of People's Commissars. Besides, there were confirmed reports of widespread bribery of Soviet, economic and party officials. The materials considered at the bureau of the provincial committee were partially transferred to the prosecutor's office with recommendations to punish the guilty, leaving most of them in their positions due to the lack of staff. It was decided not to pursue the accusations against the concessionaires any further, because the concessions were of great political importance for the Soviet state. The specific case considered in the article makes it possible to see the wide informational possibilities of the documents of the former Party archives in the study of those aspects of early Soviet life that still remain << white spots >> of history.

AB The article analyzes some aspects of the policies of the CDU and CSU, gives a forecast regarding their future course, and identifies possible political directions for Moscow in overcoming the estrangement between the Russian Federation and Germany. A noticeable decline in the popularity of the Chancellor O. Scholz's government prompts the German scientific community to raise questions about the ability of the CDU/CSU opposition bloc to give impetus to the country's modernization and protect national interests. The German Christian democracy is going through a period of evolutionary adaptation to a changing world. Its liberal, Christian, conservative and social components include the content of Atlantic attitudes, the European Union values with strengthening of the military vector, and gender philosophy. It seems that the core of voting for the CDU and CSU, among other things, consists of traditional postulates of this political trend. It also manifests itself in the policy towards Russia. Right-wing centrists incite Ukrainian radicals to transfer terrorist actions to the Russian territory, to the use of German long-range missiles by Kyiv against civilian objects in the depths of the Russian Federation. This testifies to the loss of a sense of reality among the CDU/ CSU leaders, who, under the burden of historical reflection, dream of Moscow's surrender. Although anti-Russian rhetoric is intensifying in Berlin, signs of distant realism in the CDU and CSU still appear. Even some prime ministers of the CDU in the former East Germany are cautiously for negotiations and the restoration of trade and economic ties with Moscow. The provisions in the new programs of the CDU/CSU regarding the preservation of traditions and experience in dialogue between state and civil society deserve close study. Perhaps it is here that the discussion points of contact intersect, an interface can be found for the exchange of views on the problems of education, science, demography, ecology, and on joint projects.

AB Introduction. The development of science diplomacy is aimed at promotion of a state's interests in the international arena. Russia is striving to strengthen cooperation in the field of scientific and technological development, humanitarian exchange with such MENA countries as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. These countries are of significant interest to Russia due to the long-standing forms of cooperation with them. The main purpose of this study is to identify science diplomacy actors, visually present them taking into consideration the process of science development in these countries and determine prospects of cooperation with Russia. Materials and Methods. In their study, the authors used data from open sources, Russian Federal State Statistics Service reports, UNESCO Science reports, World Bank database. The analysis of development of international science and technology cooperation in the three MENA countries was carried out. The authors used the descriptive method to present the main actors of science diplomacy and visually provide the science diplomacy systems. The developed models of science diplomacy of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates enable Russia to identify the priorities in the field of science diplomacy in the context of geopolitical challenges. Results. The study identified the potential partners of Russia in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt to strengthen international science and technology cooperation. The prospects for cooperation with these countries are fixed in the mutual agreements with Russia. The authors studied the policy of these countries in the field of international scientific and technical cooperation, considered strategic directions for the development of science diplomacy. The created models of science diplomacy reflect the main actors of science diplomacy, as well as the current interrelationship between the three MENA countries and Russia in the field of science and technology. The value of this research lies in the preparation of an extensive analytical base that helps to identify potential partners for Russia among the MENA countries, as well as identify key strategies and directions to stimulate the growth of cooperation and knowledge exchange. Discussion and Conclusion. The research has shown that in the studied Arab countries, there is an active development of scientific diplomacy. The governments of these countries are increasingly turning to science to solve political problems. The MENA region has extensive resources and scientific potential, which makes it attractive for scientific cooperation. The analysis of cooperation with these countries made it possible to identify key strategies and priorities to stimulate the growth of cooperation and knowledge exchange between the MENA countries and Russia.

AB This paper introduces a new approach to understanding the deepening of integration. It examines how and under what conditions the implementation of large projects drives integration dynamics. The study begins by analyzing the demand and supply logic that underlies the explanatory integration theories, primarily two grand theories - neofunctionalism and liberal intergovernmentalism. Both theories agree that the demand for integration is crucial but differ on the nature of interest groups (purely national vs. national and transnational), the levels at which these groups demand integration (only national vs. national and transnational), and the role of supranational institutions. Both theories acknowledge the key role of member state governments at the polity level. Neofunctionalism and institutionalism recognize the role of governments at the level of politics as well, at least when studying significant reforms of specific EU policies. National policymakers are usually ready to deliver the supply of integration (political decisions) when these decisions provide them sufficient compensation for any loss of their autonomy, usually in the form of additional pubic or elite support. What characteristics should a new integration project have in order to accumulate the demand, push politicians to deliver the supply, and be able to trigger the systemic transformation of regional integration organizations like the EU? The study proposes the concept of a transformative project - a type of integration project that can significantly impact integration dynamics and entail systemic changes in governance, polity, and degree of policy coordination. Based on an analysis of the EU's history, we outline the key characteristics of a transformative project, including complexity to induce a spillover effect, a practice-oriented nature combined with long-term political goals, broad support among stakeholders and society, tangible benefits that impact daily life to promote socialization, a solid groundwork (experience with regulation at the supranational level), and linkage to a global context. The author concludes with several assumptions about the potential of the EU Green Deal as a transformative project.

AB Randomizing different schools of thought in training altruism finds that training junior deputy ministers in the utility of empathy renders at least a 0.4 standard deviation increase in altruism. Treated ministers increased their perspective-taking: blood donations doubled, but only when blood banks requested their exact blood type. Perspective-taking in strategic dilemmas improved. Field measures such as orphanage visits and volunteering in impoverished schools also increased, as did their test scores in teamwork assessments in policy scenarios. Overall, our results underscore that the utility of empathy can be a parsimonious foundation for the formation of prosociality, even impacting the behavior of adults in the field.

The authors note that the development of statechurch relations in the history of Russia is characterized by significant changes in the socio-political sphere, including in relations between the state and the church, which have remained and remain important throughout the development of the state. The revival of the institution of the Patriarchate is one of the key topics of state -church relations in the Russian state, which is the subject of special interest in studying the deep historical roots and development of the Russian Orthodox Church, its interaction with the state. The restoration of the patriarchate has received a mixed assessment in Russian science. On the one hand, this is an important step in the development of the Church, its separation from the state, allows it to carry out its spiritual mission more freely, on the other hand, the return of the patriarchate may lead to an increase in the political influence of the Church, violating the principle of "secularism" of the state. The authors consider the problem of restoring the institution of the patriarchate at the turn of the XIX and XX centuries, analyze the activities of the Local Council, characterize the procedure for electing the patriarch, determine and announce the results of the election. The conducted research allows us to know and evaluate the impact of the church on historical processes that influenced the formation of cultural and social values, contributing to a deep analysis and interpretation of past events, helping to form a more complete understanding of the role of the church in the history of Russia.

TI Germany's Relations with China: An Uneasy Trinity of Partnership,

DT Article
DE Germany; China; European Union; partnership; competition; rivalry;
   transformation; foreign trade; investment
AB Since 2019, Brussels and Berlin have been building relations with Beijing in the paradigm of a contradictory triad of partnership, economic competition, and systemic rivalry. The current German government continues to adhere to this approach, which was enshrined in the coalition agreement. On its basis, during 2022 and the first half of 2023, the foundations of a Strategy for Relations with China were being prepared, which became the first in the history of Germany and reflected not so much the unity as the differences of the coalition parties in shaping the current Chinese vector of the German state's foreign policy. As in other strategic issues, the Social Democrats, Greens, and Liberals had to follow the path of compromise, which from the very beginning called into question the possibility of achieving the set strategic goals and objectives in the long term. This article analyzes the features of the preparation of the Chinese strategy of the Federal Government, its adoption, and the implementation of the political and economic provisions formulated in it starting from the second half of 2023. Special attention is paid to the study of the latest trends in foreign trade and investment cooperation between Germany and China in 2023-2024, as well as to the role of various government departments and the European Commission in the development of bilateral relations. The effect of the visits of the Federal Chancellor and Vice Chancellor to China in April and June 2024, which took place against the background of the aggravation of economic relations between Brussels and Beijing, is analyzed. The stumbling block was the issue of state support for Chinese business, which, from the point of view of the European Commission, distorts market competition, giving an unreasonable advantage to Chinese companies. The author attempts to predict the future of Germany-China relations in the context of the formulated triad.

AB The escalating geopolitical confrontation between the Euro-Atlantic region and Russia fundamentally determines the Arctic agenda. The security dilemma in the Arctic, which was previously considered in the paradigm of the common interest of nonmilitarization and cooperation, is becoming rather more acute. The changing approaches of Arctic actors to defining security policy are changing dramatically, primarily in all countries that have formed the Arctic Council (AC), especially after Finland and Sweden joined NATO. Russia is faced not only with attempts of Western Arctic players to push it away from planning and implementing a multilateral Arctic policy, but also with growing risks of violating the existing strategic stability and balances in the Northern Arctic area. This article examines the dilemmas of NATO's activation in the High North. It is shown that the factors that hampered the framing by the alliance of a collective Arctic strategy retain their significant impact. However, the motivation for NATO's activation there is noticeably increasing, and the NATO/Arctic discourse is becoming increasingly substantive. The United States is strengthening military cooperation with its northern allies, also the new ones on a bilateral basis, but keeping open a window of opportunity to strengthen NATO as an organization in the Arctic.

TI UK Strategy towards China: Inconsistent Consistency against the Backdrop
   of Internal Political Debates
SO HERALD OF THE RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE United Kingdom; China; special relationship with the United States; the
   Indo-Pacific; intraparty struggle; national security
AB This article is focused on the British political narrative as it has been evolving regarding China against the backdrop of widespread internal debates. It is shown how public opinion and the political elite's assessments of China changed, and what consequences this had for the development of London's foreign policy. During the period of the coalition government of D. Cameron, interparty consensus on the "China question" contributed to a dynamic political and economic dialogue between the two countries. Following the 2016 EU referendum, issues of human rights in Hong Kong, the desire for strategic independence, along with an increased sense of threat from China came to the fore, fueled by public organizations and the media and government agencies, including intelligence agencies. With the anti-Chinese lobby gaining momentum, there are forces in the political field of the United Kingdom that advocate pragmatic trade and investment cooperation with China. At the same time, their influence on decision makers has been significantly reduced. It is concluded that taking an increasingly harder line on China is down to the flimsy position of the leader of the Conservative Party, depending on various intraparty groupings. The British government's tightening of policies towards China occurred in parallel with the attempts of the leaders of the Conservative Party and part of the elite to maneuver between Sinophiles and Sinophobes in the political establishment. On the one hand, the announcement of the end of the "golden era" of British-Chinese relations did not cancel the official rhetoric about the openness of the British economy to Chinese business. On the other hand, demands to create an effective mechanism to repel the Chinese threat to democratic and economic processes within the country have intensified. The trip of the UK Foreign Secretary J. Cleverley to Beijing in 2023 showed the dependence of the course towards the PRC on the domestic political agenda and on the external context. At the same time, the inconsistent position of the Cabinet and half-hearted policies will most probably continue after the UK elections in 2024.

TI Issues of the ecology of historical and cultural territories of Nizhny
   Novgorod in the context of the formation of literary regional studies
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE literary regional studies; ecology of culture; Nizhny Novgorod; Gorky
   city; Aleksandr Svobodov; Aleksey Eliseev
AB The article examines the formation of Nizhny Novgorod literary regionalism and its impact on the ecosystem of the urban cultural environment of the late 19th - early 20th centuries. The author considers that a distinctive feature of the 1920s, when the methodological base of local history was strengthened, is the presence of not only a large number of local history enthusiasts, but also a state order. Particular attention is paid to the contribution of Aleksandr Svobodov and the Gorky Literary Museum in Nizhny Novgorod to the forming of the city's new sacral toponymy. The work of local historians not only harmonized the transformation of the urban identity from a "pocket of Russia" to a "Russian Detroit", but also partly predetermined the format of the new agglomeration, which was named Gorky. The repression of the local history movement in the USSR in 1929-1930 halted and in some ways reversed the incorporation of the older generation of intellectuals, who were initially cautious of the new government, into the socialist society they were building. Their spontaneous rapprochement, against the background of a shared interest with the proletariat in the history and culture of the local area, collapsed as the authorities did not plan to tolerate the prospect of the old "specialists" returning to the leading positions in society. Literary local history, which served as a means of harmonizing relationships between different societies, made an attempt to form a new mass urban culture in the 1920s through scientific research and the creation of a system of specialized institutions (libraries, museums, local history associations, and excursion bureaus). This process was supported by the parallel distribution of free multi-stage education, including in the field of art - music and art schools and colleges. With the advent of the first proper Soviet generation of cultural workers, the involvement of "old specialists" in cultural construction was stopped, and many of them were repressed. The inertia of the local history movement turned out to be small: the second half of the 1930s was marked by the destruction of many objects of cultural heritage. The spontaneous destruction of estates in the early years of Soviet power was replaced by a policy of targeted destruction of architectural monuments of ancient Russian (primarily church) art, necropolises, renaming of historical streets and entire settlements. From the late 1920s to the 1950s, literary regionalism survived largely thanks to the personality of Maxim Gorky. Only by referring to the Nizhny Novgorod period of the writer's biography (1868-1904) researchers gained relative freedom and were not suspected of being disloyal to the existing political regime. Currently, one of the significant resources of literary local history - the urban development of the historical center of the city and Old Kanavino - is on the verge of extinction. This can be prevented by giving Nizhny Novgorod the status of a historical settlement.

TI Leo Tolstoy and Afrikaners: Their views of each other

DE Leo Tolstoy; South African War; Second Anglo-Boer War; pro-Boer
   movements; cross-cultural interactions; Russia and South Africa; Russian
   in fl uence on South African literature
AB Tolstoy's fi ction is part of the cultural background of the South African intelligentsia. Moreover, generations of South Africans have been introduced to Tolstoy through screen adaptations of his fi ction, including Hollywood blockbusters and acclaimed TV series such as Anna Karenina (1935, 1948 and 2012) and War and Peace (1956 and 2016). Such exposure may well be the reason why, in the late 1990s, a survey among South African students of their perceptions of Russia showed that Tolstoy was the best-known Russian writer. During his lifetime, Tolstoy's work and personality were discussed extensively in Russia and abroad, including South Africa. He was one of the most in fl uential and authoritative writers in the world and remained the best-known Russian author in South Africa. Tolstoy was the only writer of Imperial Russia who, for decades, received letters and guests from South Africa. His statements on the Anglo -Boer War of 1899-1902 (also known as the South African War) attracted international attention which none of his Russian colleagues could match. Tolstoy wrote on South Africa, and his work was widely read there. Thanks to his erudition, ability to discern global trends, and interest in world culture and philosophy, Tolstoy had a profound understanding of political events in countries that he never visited and inspired leaders of liberation movements that he never met. His in fl uence on South African realist literature can be traced throughout the twentieth century. This study of Tolstoy's and South Africans' views of each other focuses on Afrikaners, because in the last ten years of his life the Russian author often wrote and spoke about them, as is evident from his published works, correspondence and the archival material in the Tolstoy museums in Moscow and Yasnaya Polyana in Russia that were used for this paper. Furthermore, Afrikaner authors seem to have referred to Tolstoy's work remarkably often. By exploring these references, one can ascertain why Tolstoy's writing remained relevant to Afrikaners and other South Africans for more than a century. In the 1890s and 1900s, Tolstoy continued to develop his doctrine of not resisting evil with violence. He used information on the Anglo -Boer War to test his radical paci fi st ideas. His protest against British imperialism in Africa echoed that of other world-famous humanist writers, such as Bj & oslash;rnstjerne Bj & oslash;rnson, Theodore Dreiser, Anatole France, Romain Rolland, Bernard Shaw, Bertha von Suttner and Mark Twain. But, unlike most of them, Tolstoy refused to support the Boers unconditionally. He sympathised with the defenders of the Boer republics, but as a principled opponent of violence he condemned those Christian people for engaging in armed struggle and killing, which he regarded as a mortal sin. During the transitional and guerrilla phases of the war, Tolstoy came to regard the continued Boer resistance to British invasion as a triumph of moral strength over immorality. He viewed the South African military con fl ict in a global context, as a typical war of a new era. Re fl ecting on the news from South Africa, he concluded that such wars were characterised by immoral goals and methods of warfare, and by non -participation in hostilities by those who directly bene fi tted from the hostilities (big entrepreneurs manipulating the government). Tolstoy argued that European governments were not interested in eradicating militarism, but nonviolent protest by ordinary people could well put an end to war.
   However, Tolstoy believed Russians, unlike participants in mass pro -Boer campaigns, were not to concern themselves with such protest because instead their main tasks were moral self-improvement and tackling injustice in their homeland. His concern with affairs in South Africa was limited to the Anglo -Boer War and the Indian civil rights campaign of the 1900s led by Gandhi, whose doctrine of satyagraha was partly based on Tolstoy's ethical teachings. Still, Tolstoy's in fl uence on Afrikaner culture has been evident for over a century. Apart from direct contact, such as visits and letters to the Russian writer, Afrikaner cultural fi gures promoted his work, translated his fi ction into Afrikaans and published their translations in almost every decade up to the 1990s. Along with other distinguished novelists of the late Imperial Russia, Tolstoy was viewed by Afrikaans authors as an exemplary realist writer who set standards that they aspired to but often regarded as unattainable. It only applied to his fi ction, because Tolstoy's confessional writings and philosophical treatises did not seem to be recognised by Afrikaans authors, especially not after the Second World War. For these authors, Tolstoy was primarily a fi ction writer. Tolstoy's work featured in South African literary debates with regard to resistance to abusive state authority and grappled with censorship. His fi ction reminded South Africans of the humanist ideals that were meant to guide those who wanted to bring about positive change in an unjust, deeply divided society. Tolstoy's work stimulated introspection and re fl ection on literary mastery, the ethical standards of a writer and one's purpose in life.

DE The Russian Empire; the abolition of serfdom; Alexander II; the Secret

AB This article is devoted to the study of the reform of the abolition of serfdom in the context of its main causes and stages. The study includes not only the theme of Alexander II's Manifesto on the liberation of peasants from 1861, but also an analysis of a number of normative acts adopted since the end of the XVIII century, the subject of which were preliminary steps aimed at the subsequent acquisition of personal rights and freedoms by serfs. In particular, this article examines such documents as: The Manifesto of Paul I "On three-day serfdom", the Decree of Alexander I "On free farmers", the Regulations on the peasants of Estonia and Livonia, as well as the Decree of Nicholas I "On obliged peasants". The authors of the article pay sufficient attention to external and internal factors that served as the reasons and prerequisites for the adoption of the reform on the abolition of serfdom, such as the defeat in the Crimean War, the industrial and technical revolution, the social crisis, the increased peasant riots, the development of higher education and, at the same time, changes in the worldview of the enlightened segment of the population of the Russian Empire. In addition, the article examines in detail the internal political processes for organizing activities aimed at preparing and implementing the reform of serfdom. The authors analyzed the course of preparation of the draft peasant reform and formulated the key contradictions that represented a number of obstacles to the implementation of the reform.

AB The article undertakes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the categories of the extreme - words describing the state of the maximum physical and psychological stress of a person used in the plots of the Soviet press of 1946-1956 devoted to citizens' work. The source base of the research is materials of the Soviet press at various levels (central, regional, city, factory): the Smena magazine; central newspapers Pravda and Trud; regional newspapers Uralskiy Rabochiy, Velikolukskaya Pravda, Vostochno-Sibirskaya Pravda, Sovetskaya Sibir', and Krasnyy Sever; city newspapers Tagil'skiy Rabochiy and Pod Znamenem Lenina; the factory newspaper MagnitogorskiyMetall. When analyzing the textual content of Soviet press materials, the content analysis method (frequency sampling) was used. The total number of the processed newspaper materials amounted to 2,640 issues and 66 issues of the Smena magazine. The lexical units used in describing the labor achievements of the townspeople, which have connotations of maximum exertion, overcoming, and feat, were combined into the groups "labor as overcoming" and "labor as feat". A large number of references to the lexical forms of these groups were observed in the central newspapers Pravda and Trud. Chronologically, in all the analyzed publications, the largest number of references to the words of the groups "labor as overcoming" and "labor as feat" was noted in 1946-1948, gradually decreasing in the first half of the 1950s and reaching minimum values in 1956. The concept "difficult" was accompanied by pronounced positive connotations in the printed discourse of the period. The positivity of this concept was determined by the need for difficulties (and their selfless overcoming) as elements of the image of a heroic Soviet person, constructed in the information space of the period. The concept "easy" was revealed through rather negative characteristics. The opposition of the categories "difficult" and "easy" was reinforced by their synchronization with the main antithesis of the Soviet discourse: "socialism- capitalism". In the 1950s, in the domestic print media, a significant decrease in the level of dynamism, emotionality, and extremity in the description of citizens' labor practices is recorded. The texts devoted to work acquire a more informative character. The revealed transformation of the propaganda rhetoric of the media correlated with the results of the post-war reconstruction of the country, the dynamics of modernization processes, and changes in the political situation.

AB The article studies the cleavage structures of Russian regions based on the results of elections to regional assemblies in 2021 and analyzes changes compared to previous elections. Factor analysis reveals factors of territorial differences in party voting (electoral cleavages), issue dimensions and sub-dimensions of political space, as well as factors of demographic and socio-economic inter-territorial differentiation. Correlation analysis and multiple regression (OLS) help determine whether electoral cleavages have a political interpretation and a social basis. It demonstrates that the regional elections of 2021 largely reproduced the cleavage structure of 2016, but with some changes. What was common was the almost identical total number of participants and the factors of territorial differences in party voting. The difference was the increase in the number of `complete' electoral cleavages and political subdimensions; the emergence of new actors; expansion of the agenda. It is also noted, that the confrontation between the `party of power' and other participants in domestic politics and the socio-economic sphere constituted the political content of the main electoral cleavage, while the confrontation between market liberals and protectionists in the socio-economic sphere competed for second place with the socio-cultural confrontation. The most common social background of electoral cleavages remained urbanization, which was the main predictor in most cases. At the same time, the importance of economic activity of the population has increased, displacing the factor of demographic characteristics from second place.

DE Galicia; WWI; Rusins; Volhynia; Volhynian periodicals
AB The article reconstructs the history of Galicia in the early years ofWWI (1914-1915), viewed through the lens of journalistic materials in the Volhynian periodicals, most of which have never been studied before.The Volhynian periodicals, keenly responding to the local events, published a lot on the history, ethnography, and political development of the region. Based on these articles,the author considers the repressions oftheAustro- Hungarian government against Rusins on the eve of and during WWI, the ethno-cultural characteristics of the region, the relationship between the Russian administration and the local population, religious activities of Archbishop Evlogy (Georgievsky) in Galicia, the agrarian question, and a range of other important issues. According to the author, the Volhynian periodicals, regardless of their political affiliation, supported the Russian army in Galicia and agreed on their assessments of the situation in the region and the Russian administration's policy on its restoration. They did not coincide on two important issues - the Russian and Ukrainophile movements in Galicia and the national identification of Galician Rusins, and the methods for solving the agrarian question. The liberal periodicals in Volhynia, promoting the idea of Ukraine's independence, classified the population of Galicia as "Ukrainians." The right-wing and the Black Hundred periodicals, acknowledging the ethno-cultural peculiarities of the local population, considered it to be Russians following the idea of All-Russian Unity. Within the context of the agrarian question, the liberal periodicals advocated the renounciation of abolition of landlord property rights and opposed the transfer of lands to peasants. The right-wing press suggested that the lands should be expropriated "on a case-by-case basis" depending on the attitude of landlords to Russia and the Russian Army.

TI THE EVOLUTION OF U.S. "STRATEGIC AMBIGUITY" POLICY TOWARDS TAIWAN

DT Article
DE USA; PRC; China; Taiwan; US foreign policy; Taiwan issue; strategic

AB The article is dedicated to the analysis of "strategic ambiguity" concept - a tool of U.S. foreign policy aimed at dual deterrence of both mainland China and breakaway Taiwan. Washington stayed deliberately ambiguous in its commitments to defend Taiwan thus leaving Beijing uncertain whether the U.S. will intervene in case of escalation in the Strait, and at the same time not encouraging Taiwanese authorities to declare full independence and sovereignty which would provoke military escalation with mainland China, dragging the U.S. into full-scale conflict with the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). The article analyzes the roots of this approach during D. Eisenhower's years in office, its evolution encourse and after the Cold War, and its erosion under D. Trump and J. Biden. The article shows that the U. S. President Eisenhower wished to maintain status-quo in Taiwan Strait, fearing that he would either have to turn a blind eye on the communist takeover of Taiwan, or be dragged into conflict with the close ally of Moscow, which would eventually lead to the war with the USSR. Eisenhower and his administration remained ambiguous in their communications with the PRC (mainland China) and Taiwan, not encouraging the island to declare full independence and at the same time not giving Beijing a carte blanche for military intervention. This approach dubbed in political science and international relations theory as "strategic ambiguity" proved to be useful, and was reinforced during Washington-Beijing rapprochement in 1970s. Under Trump administration, the U.S. started to consider dropping the "strategic ambiguity" policy towards clearer deterrence commitments. This trend manifested via emotional statements made by Donald Trump himself, mostly on social media, as well as through a change of tone in key foreign policy documents and new decisions that signaled a serious revision of the American approach to military cooperation between the United States and Taiwan. This trend continued and exacerbated under Biden administration due to number of bills signed, including the Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act (TERA) which de-facto dubbed the contested island as Washington's "Major Non-NATO Ally" and enabled to boost military supplies. The erosion of the "strategic ambiguity" policy also manifested through various high-profile contacts, including the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit on the island.

AB The author's calculations and models show that although the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) suffered greatly as a result of the plunder of their human and natural resources by the countries of the West during the period of colonial oppression and the centuries-old era of the slave trade, they have managed - after they gained political independence - to achieve on the whole a number of positive socio-economic results. The gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) as a percentage of GDP has doubled, the average number of years of education of the adult population has increased six times, the average life expectancy at birth has augmented by one and a half times, and the human development index has risen by 2.5 times. However, since SSA countries are growing on average slowly and unsteadily, the gap between SSA and the advanced economies as well as many Asian developing countries (ADCs) by levels of development has enlarged significantly, and the total number of poor people in SSA has more than tripled over the past forty years, reaching 1 billion people. Besides the demographic dividend coefficient that is almost twice as low as in ADCs, the low dynamics of per capita GDP growth in SSA, according to our model, is associated by 1/3, 1/4 and 1/10, respectively, with the low rate of GFCF, low growth rates of exports (mainly raw materials), low level of social institutions. Since the assistance of the countries of the West is small and decreasing, and the capacity of markets in SSA countries is low, in order to avoid worsening the situation, they need to (a) increase the share of investments in physical and human capital in GDP at least one and a half times (including by reducing unproductive use of resources), (b) more actively develop intra-African cooperation and foreign economic relations with other developing countries and the Russian Federation, (c) rely on export-oriented industrialization (as SSA lags the most - 3-4 times - behind ADCs in terms of output growth rates of manufacturing industry).

AB In the context of excessive information and audience fragmentation, it makes sense for sociologists and political scientists to consider new ways of political communication that have the properties of viral and interactive content. This is why this article discusses the new media content used to ideas spreading in the society of "information niches". Edutainment combines entertainment and education elements. Edutainment due to its ability to simultaneously entertain and educate has the resources of involvement and persuasion, which are characteristic of political communications. The author analyzes one of edutainment variants - online quizzes and tests that are used to create educational texts (for example, the Arzamas project). The author's aim is an empirical analysis of online history quizzes gameplay, which makes this type of game the tool for civil and political involvement and persuasion. The research results are discussed in the light of gratifications theory, which makes it possible to determine how any video games, even the simplest casual ones, initiate positive emotions among gamers. Online history quizzes use the technique of transferring signs from one epoch to another, creating a memorable humorous effect. In addition, the game is a constantly rewarded activity, and the size of game failures in online quizzes is minimal and can be emotionally controlled. Improved mood makes casual minigames a pocket generator of positive emotions that can unobtrusively broadcast various ideas, including political ones. In the article, online quiz game procedures are analyzed using the experience of game studies. The tradition of game studies emphasizes the persuasiveness of games through involvement in a playful procedure. Disassembling any computer game, we see a set of actions: firstly, gamer's actions according to the rules; secondly, actions that develop something in the game; and, thirdly, gamer's actions controlling the situation outside the game. Separately and in combination, these components constitute a model of human play activity. However, according to the game studies, a computer game is played on two levels: by the gamer and by the console/computer that runs the game software. The game session is composed of conflicting relationships between a human and a game as smart technology. At the same time, the gamer often - even within one game session - alternates playing "against" and playing "together" with a digital game. In online quizzes, the game software takes the position of the opponent, who provides conflict by offering tasks, but at the same time it works as the arbiter who identifies gamer's success. Online history quizzes check knowledge of facts, artifacts, heroes, and event maps. Let it be minimal, but historical quizzes are associated with the in-game environment control, which stimulates memorization. The author concludes: being minigames, online quizzes today serve as an interesting complementary content, a kind of "icing on the cake", increasing attention to any facts, personalities, or historical and cultural cases.

AB Accepted Abstract. The article examines a complex of different types of problems that the Joe Biden administration faced when pursuing a course in the field of education, identifies painful points in its system, shows the ratio of successes and failures in educational policy and the extent to which the White House has taken into account changes in the demand for graduates in the labor market USA and in the perception of young Americans about the value of a university. Higher education in this country is considered a source of pride and the key to unlocking the American Dream. American universities rank nineteenth out of the top thirty in the world's university rankings, and nine of the most successful universities are located in this country. However, behind this facade lies the accumulation of financial, personnel, social and racial problems in educational institutions. An analysis is given of the decline in the attractiveness of college in the eyes of the younger generation of Americans, caused by some devaluation of the diploma on the labor market, the rising cost of education and the increase in student debt on loans. In turn, the factors for the high cost of education are: the cycle of supply and demand, inflation, bloated administrative, teaching staff and university staff, whose work is ultimately paid for out of the pockets of students and their parents. An alternative to college and university that offers a faster and much cheaper route to a career in the form of short-term online courses and technical education schools is becoming popular among a significant portion of the younger generation. A special section is devoted to the analysis of the political and intellectual movement called Critical Race Theory, which has penetrated the curriculum of schools and colleges in many American states and identified another line of division in American

TI CHINA'S STRATEGIC NARRATIVE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM AND ITS

DT Article
DE China; foreign policy; narrative; strategic narrative; discourse power

AB States seek to attribute preferable meanings to international order and its different dimensions and thus shape policy choices of other international actors. During the presidency of Xi Jinping, the PRC has accelerated the development of its discourse power, which includes attempts to promote its own vision of international order. While the contents of China's strategic narratives about the international system have been quite well summarized and discussed in the existing scholarship, other aspects of China's external communication have received less attention. This article aims to fill this gap and analyzes how China adapts its messages to different national audiences. We approach this question by comparing China's strategic narratives about the international system disseminated by the PRC diplomats serving in the African Union, Kazakhstan, Russia and the US. Our analysis demonstrates that there is general coherence between the narratives that Chinese diplomats project. Appeals to the selected past experiences are used to question the fairness and inclusiveness of the contemporary world order dominated by western countries. Global challenges complicated by the exiting unfairness requires the new leader that can guide united response and fix the injustices. Despite the obvious similarities, the Chinese diplomats add details and emphasis to the narratives to fit in different communication environments. In particular, they use local jargon and appeal to different historical experiences and political myths. We show that local beliefs and values are incorporated in Chinese narratives to generate new shared meanings that accommodate China's diverse foreign policy goals. For instance, in the case of African Union, colonialism and decolonization are examples of past experience most often used in China's narrative, while in case of Russia these are appeals to Great Patriotic War.

AB The situation in the Near East is important for each power, especially for the rising one. Germany belongs to the last category. The article tries to explore the forms, features and results of the FRG`s usage of political and military tools in the Near East by the mid-2020s. For two decades, Germany was trying to become security and stability provider for regional actors, to ensure strategic influence in the zones of armed conflicts. But in Iraq and especially in Syria, the results of Berlin's participation in the struggle against the "Islamic state" (Terrorist organization banned in Russia) were rather modest. Hence, the Bundeswehr was forced to short its presence in Iraq and to reduce it to zero in Syria by the early 2020s. Rather important for Germany was the critical lack of opportunities to influence over growing strategic activity of the key regional actors. The FRG has faced the fact of distancing with Turkey which demonstrated its special position from other Western democracies on many regional issues. In 2010s, Germany made significant efforts to relieve tensions around Iran (because of its nuclear program and the confrontation with Saudi Arabia), but in the early 2020s, Berlin turned to the containment of this country. There has been also the disruption of the previous balance in the development of Germany's partnership with Israel, Jordan, Palestinian National Authority, and Lebanon (official Beirut). Berlin starts to see the relations with Tel-Aviv as the highest priority. All the tendencies have received noticeable development during the war in the Gaza Strip since October 2023.

AB The article presents a metatextual analysis of the first Siberian multi-author poetry collection SibirskieMotivy [Siberian Motifs], published in 1886 by philanthropist I.M. Sibiryakov, a representative of a well-known merchant family, which had a significant impact on the development of regional culture. The publication is based on the lyrical cycle of the same name by the Siberian poet I.V. Fedorov-Omulevsky, which he created in 1881-1883 shortly before his death and which reflected the result of his creative reflections on the fate of his native land. The relevance of the article is due to two factors: (1) the interest of modern Siberian studies in imagological studies of the diachronic reception of the multifaceted image of Siberia in the collective and individual author's consciousness and its representation in texts of different types and genres; (2) the need for a comprehensive understanding of how the regional literary process developed in the 19th century, especially in the context of the interrelation of all-Russian and Siberian literature. The novelty lies in the appeal to the previously unexplored material in the literary aspect of the first Siberian multi- author poetry collection. The study aims to clarify the specifics of the representation of the image of Siberia in works of fiction and to introduce new material on the "Siberian text" into scholarly discourse. The research methodology is based on a metatextual approach, in which multi-author literary collections are considered as special textual units - "literary ensembles". Taking into account the object of research and the typological features of the first poetry collection Siberian Motifs, the conceptual field of the current work additionally includes aspects of the theory of lyrical cycles, the problems of books of poetry and components of the geopoetic analysis of the text. It is established that the image of Siberia acquires versatility and ambiguity in Siberian Motifs" due to the overlap of various poetic interpretations in a chronological perspective, as a result of which historical, ideological, political and social contexts of the formation and perception of the region arise. The idea that the point of view on Siberia is determined by a look at its past (what it was), present (what it has become), and future (what it can become) runs through the entire collection as a backbone, fastening it into an integral metatext. At the same time, the leitmotif of human development, maturation, and flourishing is realized in the bosom of Siberian nature, with which difficult step-by-step relationships are built, coupled with motifs for gaining inner freedom, overcoming life difficulties, and acquiring spiritual renewal. The most significant in the collection turns out to be the generally life-affirming worldview of Siberian authors, characterized by pride in their native land and people, faith in their cultural rise, resistance to past adversities and future challenges.

AB The aim of this article is to reconstruct the history of the iconographic version "Copy of the Icon of St. Nicholas on the Nikolsky Gates of the Kremlin, which Suffered from Shelling During the Revolution of 1917 on 31 October". This will make it possible to add information on the religious and political-ideological evolution of Russian society during the Civil War. The type of the icon under study reproduced the appearance of the fresco of St. Nicholas from one of the Kremlin towers after its damage during the storming of the citadel by the Red Guards. After the spontaneous destruction of the decorative red cloth hiding the icon on 2 May 1918, which many Orthodox believers perceived as a miracle, this icon acquired the status of an anti-Bolshevik symbol. It is likely that between 22 May and mid-June 1918 at least two surviving copies of the damaged Kremlin fresco were produced in Moscow or in the central region, in one of the icon-painting workshops. The article explains under what circumstances, when and why one of these icons ended up in Perm, at Archbishop Andronik (Nikolsky). The circumstances of the presentation of this icon to Alexander Kolchak as a blessing by the administrator of the Perm Eparchy, Bishop Boris (Shipulin), are detailed. On 15-16 March 1919, during the meetings between Kolchak and Archbishop Sylvester (Olshevsky), two initiatives were launched. First, it was decided to publish a mass of leaflets with an image of the icon and a story about it. Second, it was decided to hold two "religious-patriotic processions" in Omsk on 23 March and 30 March 1919, with the gift from Bishop Boris at the center of these demonstrations. Soon, the Russkaya Armiya newspaper published an article "Significant Icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker". Therein, the creators of the newly formed cult outlined a kind of a "legend about the miracle-working icon". Both processions received a broad media coverage and contributed to the design of the ideology of the Kolchak regime. The political part of the action went beyond the confessional boundaries; representatives of the interventionists-Protestants and Catholics-played an important role there. The article describes and analyses eight images of this iconographic version, some of which are introduced for the first time. The information is added about the iconographers who made some of these icons: A.Y. Vashurov and I.V. Volkov. The history of these icons at the final stage of the Civil War and afterwards in emigration is reconstructed. The conclusion is made that Orthodox religiosity was widely and deliberately used by the counter-revolutionary authorities for the purposes of political mobilisation. The powerful religious substratum of Russian culture favoured the emergence of new but intrinsically traditional symbols, like this icon. However, the mobilisation potential of the new symbols was limited by the general nature of the ideological system of the anti-Bolshevik movement. Religious symbolism failed to become a truly consolidating political instrument.

AB The article aims at identifying the phenomenon of labor interethnic division in Podolsk province. Based on the 1897 census data, the authors prove that labor intereth nic division, based on different ways of life support for ethnic groups and essential for the eastern regions of the Empire, was an insignificant phenomenon for Podolsk province. The 1897 census of Podolsk province recorded a total of 3,018,299 people, including 750,915 economically active persons and 2,267,384 of their dependants. The main occupation of the population in the province was agriculture, which ensured the expanded reproduction of the workforce: 466,006 (62.0% of all employed in the national economy) independent farmers provided for themselves and 1,799,715 family members (dependants), or in other words, one fed another 3.9 people. In addition to agriculture, residents of Podolsk province were engaged in industry - 61,775 (8.2%), service sector - 75,766 (10.1%), trade - 47,338 (6.3%), transport - 7,575 (1.1%). 5,164 people or 0.7% of all workers were employed in regional administration; 3,595 or 0.5 % - in institutions of culture, education, science, and medical care; 6,397 or about 0.9 % - in religious institutions; 33,684 or 4.5% - in the armed forces. Bythe late 19th century, labor interethnic division in Podolsk province was dependant on political and economic factors. The destruction of the estate system in the province was manifested primarily in the fact that 38,231 peasants moved to the city. Another stream of local migrations was the movement of burghers to rural areas. The number of burghers in Podolsk province was 3 times higher than the number of burghers in cities: 492,995 against 164,582. These were primarilyJews, Little Russians, and Poles. The Great Russian population performed the main connecting economic, cultural, and administrative functions.The relative majority of the independent Great Russian population were military personnel. The Little Russians, who totally made up 2,542,637, that is, the majority of the population in the province, also held a relative majority in the cities - they numbered 105,757 or 47.7% of the townspeople (Table 2). Jews, concentrated in cities and towns, played an important role in commercial and industrial life, administration and culture.

DE nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula; denuclearization; DPRK; USA;
   ROK; peace treaty; security guarantees; deterrence; escalation
AB The article attempts to analyze the situation surrounding the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula. Today, the nuclear issue is a whole complex of issues related to security on the Korean Peninsula. These include, first of all, the implementation by the North Korean leadership of programs to create nuclear and missile weapons in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the adoption by Pyongyang of a military doctrine allowing for the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the event of a conflict in Korea, as well as reciprocal steps from the United States and the Republic of Korea (ROK), aimed at implementing nuclear deterrence. Considering the reasons for the failure of international negotiations, the author pays attention to the proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to conclude a peace treaty (non-aggression treaty) with the United States, as well as other North Korean initiatives aimed at normalizing relations with the U. S. By failing to respond rationally to these steps, Washington missed the opportunity to reach an agreement with Pyongyang on a mutually acceptable basis. Particular attention is paid to new aspects in the approaches of DPRK, which declares the "irreversibility" and "legitimate nature" of its nuclear status. Today, the path to a nuclear settlement on the Korean Peninsula appears to be much more difficult than it was a decade ago, and certainly during the Six-Party Talks (2003-2008). Now the states involved are demonstrating mutual bitterness, categorical rejection of each other, and are relying primarily on forceful methods to protect their own interests. Therefore, returning to a normal diplomatic agenda, which alone will create a chance to resolve the nuclear and other problems of the Korean Peninsula, is possible only through de-escalation of confrontation, transition from military-political deterrence to restraint, and restoration of interrupted communication channels between interested states. Apparently, this will require time and considerable effort from all participants.

AB Tectonic changes in the system of modern geo-economic relations necessitate the revision of many theoretical postulates. One of them is the unconditional benefit of participating in integration associations. The purpose of the study is to assess the real scale of benefits received by Central-Eastern European countries from participation in the EU. The study of the relatively long experience of membership of Central- Eastern European countries in the EU allowed to formulate some conclusions, the most significant of which are: the excessive ideological and political argumentation used in Central-Eastern European countries in the initial period of decision-making on accession to the EU, which significantly reduced the effectiveness of the analysis of the economic consequences of the future membership; the significant methodological complexity of conducting a quantified analysis of the macroeconomic aspects of EU membership and, therefore, the difficulty of determining the quantifiable impact of the general effects of integration in relation to the countries of Central-Eastern Europe; the presence of overly optimistic assessments of the effectiveness of Central-Eastern European countries receiving transfers from the EU budget.

DE Union State of Russia and Belarus; Near Abroad; cooperation; political

AB The new realities of the modern world have brought to the fore the need for more effective development of the existing international structures in the post-Soviet space. Such a specific developing formation as the Union State of Russia and Belarus (SGRB) is among them. Analysis of the SGRB activities at present stage (2019-2023) is the main research task of this article. Particular attention is paid to the prospects of the Union State, taking into account the modern international realities. They are sufficiently affected by the Russian Special Military Operation (SVO) in Ukraine, which was launched on February 24, 2022, and the accompanying unprecedent "wave" of sanctions initiated by the collective West against Russia and Belarus. Under these conditions, the very logic and functioning of the Union State have undergone significant changes, so that the coalition of the two states, which initially focused mainly on socio-economic interaction, began to increasingly acquire political and even military features. At present, the Union State highlights a number of serious projects in the sphere of financial, economic, social, and humanitarian cooperation. Although Russia and Belarus face many difficulties and contradictions in their cooperation within the framework of the international association created by them, their political and military interaction has become an important component of the Union State's activities. The SGRB represents to some extent a new segment of regional interaction and integration in the Russian Near Abroad. The analysis of different stages in the Union State development after 2019, when the 20th anniversary of the SUBR was celebrated, facilitates an overall assessment of the effectiveness of political integration processes in the post-Soviet space. The results of the study help to determine the possibility of using the Union State's experience to create new interstate associations in the territories of the former Soviet Union.

AB The focus of this article is the phenomenon of disinformation and foreign interference in Italy. The aim of the study is to examine Italy's approach to countering interference and combating disinformation. The article presents a scientific discussion on the terminology of the concept of "interference" and demonstrates that the lack of a definition does not detract from the results obtained on the topic. In countering interference in the broadest sense, as a threat to national security and the constitutional order of the country, Italy relies primarily on the national resources, where the main body is a special structure - the System for the Security of the Republic. The Special Parliamentary Committee for the Security of the Republic plays an important role as well. The issue of disinformation as an intervention tool has received more attention from researchers and institutions. The EU clearly distinguishes between "disinformation" and "misinformation". In 2023, Italy was the first EU country to spread disinformation (in terms of the amount of deleted content from social media). In combating disinformation, Italy relies on the EU's guidelines and experience, transferring content moderation responsibilities to the EU level. The EU reacts with harsh methods, resorting to content removal and blocking of resources. Thus, the more Italy delegates its information security to the European Union, the more Rome involves in the information confrontation and war of narratives between Brussels and Moscow.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of relations between Saudi Arabia and its two largest partners - the United States, which is its strategic ally, and China, relations with which are rapidly developing, covering ever new areas of cooperation. Each of these states, from the Saudi point of view, has its own advantages and disadvantages that limit its capabilities. The article will examine the history of Saudi Arabia establishing a strategic partnership with these states, the main directions of their cooperation, and the extent to which each of them can help to realize its strategic goals including in the program - National Vision 2030. The USA and China act as competitors, not only at the global level, but also in the Middle East region. However, the development of relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States, on the one hand, as well as Saudi Arabia and China, meets its national interests, and not the desire to play on their contradictions. For their part, the Saudi Kingdom with its energy, financial resources and political influence in the Arab and Muslim worlds, is interesting to both of them, from a strategic, geopolitical and economic point of view. The author presented different assessments of Saudi-American and Saudi-Chinese interactions which were articulated by experts and analysts from Russia, the USA and Saudi Arabia and compared them. We can agree with the opinion of Saudi experts and politicians that their country do not desire to make a choice between these partners which are very useful to Saudi Arabia and shear with it important political approaches.

   development of trade relations, technological exchanges and cooperation

DE macrocrisis; geopolitics; fragmentation and divisions; centers of power
   - periphery; USA - China - Russia - Europe; new world order
AB The world has entered an acute phase of a protracted macrocrisis, one of the most striking manifestations of which is the processes of disengagement in global politics. The logic of confrontation inevitably aggravates old conflicts and reproduces new ones. The centrifugal dynamics received an explosive impetus because of directly interconnected process of internationalisation of the Ukrainian crisis and "Ukrainisation" of the Western-centric agenda. Conflict motives of local, regional, geopolitical divides, and gaps are acquiring increasing practical and political significance. The logic of asymmetrical, multidirectional interactions in global politics is rapidly gaining momentum. The previously inertial confrontation between the United States and Russia, the United States and China has moved into the acute phase of a dangerous confrontation. The potential for resolving the most important geopolitical and military-strategic problems in their relations has been reduced by US efforts to a critical minimum. A focused reflection of geopolitical divisions has become the sophisticated construction of a new Iron Curtain around Russia by the united West. The world is actually divided into the World Majority, whose countries take a neutral or favorable position towards Russia, and a non-structurally formalised coalition of countries led by the United States, guided by American foreign policy goals and priorities. Lines of demarcation and fragmentation run across a variety of spheres and formats, regional and geopolitical areas, erecting new boundaries and barriers in interstate cooperation and creating a dangerous tilt and distortions in strategic security. In the context of the chaotisation of world politics and the rapid development of centrifugal processes of geopolitical and geo-economic demarcations and confrontations, the asymmetry of approaches to the prospects for reformatting the world order is becoming increasingly visible.

AB "Political Rumors: Why We Accept Misinformation and How to Fight It" is the result of Adam Berinsky's long -term research, which analyses different aspects of rumors as a form of inaccurate information. It examines how rumors spread and persist in media space due to their virality, repetition and social transmission. Factors related to the belief in misinformation are highlighted, among them the tendency to conspiracy thinking and dogmatism, as well as political non-involvement. Combining psychological and political science approaches, the author focuses on the peculiarities of perception of rumors and their refutations. Although the effect is short -term, a productive strategy is to correct rumors that resonate with an individual's political orientation. Through a series of experiments, the book proves the propensity of people to confirm their beliefs, whereby sources whose party identity matches the person's perceptions have greater credibility. In contrast, in the case of refutations, information broadcast by sources that benefit from the rumor, respectively, come into opposition with one's political attitudes and partisanship. The book offers a new way of considering the possibilities of unmasking rumors by employing psychological and heuristic mechanisms of information perception and shifting attention from neutral sources of debunking to those with distinct political biases.

AB The article analyses the dynamics of Belarusian-Lithuanian relations in the post-Soviet period. The historical, cultural and political-economic aspects of the relationship between the two countries are considered. It is noted that Lithuania is the second most active European player in Belarus after Poland. The author emphasises the historical aspect of the relationship between the two countries and demonstrates how different interpretations of the heritage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania affect the modern relationship between the two states and their peoples. We are talking primarily about the heritage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Lithuanian myth generates competition between the two countries, but at the same time forms an idea of the common space of their historical destinies, which fuels Westernising and pro-European sentiments among a part of Belarusian society. The author notes that Lithuania's foreign policy towards Belarus is dominated by an ideological approach. Lithuania tries to play the role of an operator of democratic changes and the Western geopolitical turn of its eastern neighbor. In this niche a strong competition with Poland and the traditional xenophobia of Lithuanian society towards the Slavs limit the possibilities of Lithuanian influence on Belarus. For its part, Minsk was focused on pragmatic cooperation with Lithuania in the economic sphere and put issues of politics and ideology aside. In particular, Belarus had high hopes for cooperation in the field of energy and transit. The discrepancy between these approaches determines the tense and conflict nature of relations between the two countries.

AB The article is dedicated to one of the key problems of our time - migration processes in Europe and their consequences on the example of the Benelux countries. The purpose of the study is to identify the features of the migration policy of the Benelux countries in recent years, the mechanisms of their regulatory and legal system, capable or unable to regulate migration processes. Using the comparative-institutional method, as well as event analysis, the trends of migration in this region as a recipient of a significant influx of emigrants and refugees, are shown. Attention is focused on the common and distinctive features of the migration policy of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The author notes the generally liberal approach of the Benelux countries to solving the problem, which to a certain extent damages their national interests, creates social and humanitarian problems. The authorities of these countries are faced with an increase in migration from Muslim countries and their religious attitudes, the refugee crisis, and issues of social adaptation and integration of migrants. Immigration processes are accompanied by an increase in crime, destabilization of the internal situation, and discontent of the local population. The authorities are forced to periodically review their political and diplomatic tools, adapt and modify them in order to reduce the number of illegal migrants and the risks of renewed conflicts on ethnic and religious grounds. The author relied on the works of domestic and foreign authors, statistical information of European migration services, as well as information from international experts in this field. As a result, the characteristics of the migration policy of the countries under study are given, the consequences of mass migrations are determined. The author substantiates the conclusion that the solution to the migration issue in the Benelux countries is not visible in the near future, despite the coordinated efforts of their security structures. Effective management of migration and mitigation of negative consequences have yet to be developed and put into practice.

ID SOFT POWER
AB The paper deals with the latest developments in Britain's socio-cultural influence on the world stage, including changes in institutional design of governance as well as sources and volume of financing. Primary funding source as well as official conceptual framework for the development of British foreign policy influence programs is provided by the development assistance policy. The author looks into the structure and dynamics of expenditures and draws a comparison with other leading Western powers. The research shows no significant transformations of approaches over the last decade as far as general logic and influence mechanisms are concerned. However, the paper identifies trends towards growing politicisation and weaponisation of sociocultural influence. The conclusion is made that Britain's foreign influence policies are in the process of the biggest upheaval over the last 25 years amidst funding cuts and more strict subordination to short-term national interests and political priorities. These changes are not unprecedented in terms of British foreign policy history, including the Thatcher era. Socio-cultural influence remains significant, and frequently essential London's foreign policy tool. The British establishment makes attempts to readjust and sharpen the existing influence toolkit according to the logic of interstate rivalry. London effectively tries to return to previous historical epochs in the new international setting and altered global balance of power. These decisions appear to a great extent opportunistic and do not promise consistence and soundness to the chosen political course although they contribute to its growing unpredictability.

AB The authors propose the concept of energy relocation as a phenomenon of the 2020s, expressed in the form of a global sharp redirection of energy flows, collectively forming a circular movement of oil and gas resources from the West to the East, reflected by shocks in the energy markets. It is substantiated that its driver is a change in the global economic paradigm during the transition to a new multipolar system based on strategic alliances. In this regard, relocation is a reflection of the underlying processes of change in the world economy. Energy relocation was the result of an accumulated crisis that has developed successively since 2008. to 2023 in three stages, characterized as the Shale Revolution, "European displacement" and Russian "turn to the East". The authors substantiate that, taken together, the three listed phenomena form a single process of energy relocation, because have a consistent logic and a single economic nature. Having become the result of a change in the international economic paradigm, energy relocation itself is shaping a new future of the world, in which the energy issue will remain dominant. Understanding this issue in the new system of strategic alliances is natural through the prism of the process of energy relocation. The authors propose a conceptual framework for such an understanding, and, accordingly, the possibility of moving to a new theoretical quality of forecasting the development of the world economy and energy.

AB The article highlights and analyzes the changes brought by the Trump and Biden administrations to the U. S. Taiwan policy. The driving forces behind the introduced changes to this policy, according to the article, were the rise of China and the changing military balance in the Taiwan Strait, Beijing's growing diplomatic, military and economic pressure on Taipei since 2016, Taiwan's political transformation and the rise of a distinct Taiwanese identity, an overall escalation of tensions between China and Taiwan, as well as a reassessment of the American approach towards the PRC in favor of pursuing a containment policy. The author characterizes the U.S. activities in the Taiwan issue under the Trump and Biden administrations as "salami" tactics - taking small, non-military or quasi-military steps, each of which remains below the threshold of military response on the part of China, but ultimately brings to the desired goal - to increase the overall level of support of Taiwan and its defense capabilities in the event of the PRC's military operation. Among such small steps by Washington, in particular, there are the public reference of to the 1982 Six Assurances as one of the pillars of the "One China" policy (in addition to the Taiwan Relations Act and the three U.S.-China communiqu & eacute;s), increasing the intensity and the level of contacts between American officials and their Taiwanese counterparts, deepening military cooperation and especially increasing the number of American troops in Taiwan, creating multilateral platforms for interaction between Taiwan and a wide range of countries, involving American allies in ensuring security in the Taiwan Strait, etc. Each of these steps individually does not allow us to talk about significant changes in Washington's approach to the Taiwan issue, but taken together they form a critical mass, indicating serious shifts in the American recognition of Taiwan's role.

AB The topic of cooperation between the USSR and the USA in the economic, scientific and technical fields during the years of detente in bilateral relations (1969-1979) has been developed by American and European historians, political scientists, economists and experts in international relations theory for 50 years. This review describes the main stages of evolution of the foreign historiography on this problem. The authors consider the development of trade relations, technological exchanges and cooperation in the field of science as a coherent whole due to their "multilayered nature" and cumulative impact on the overall dynamics and final results of the Cold War. It is noted that from the very beginning, the formation of investigative issues was greatly influenced by theoretical works, as well as memoirs and diaries of American statesmen, Presidents, Secretaries of State, Assistants to the President for National Security Affairs, who were direct participants in the events. It is proved that in modern foreign studies, there is a tendency to belittle the significance of the experience of detente as a special model of relations between the East and the West. There is an attitude to the achievements of the exploratory programs implemented in those years as something situational and insignificant. Another conclusion concerns the difference in the emphasis of domestic and foreign authors regarding the choice of research issues. While the former tend to pay attention to the potential, implemented and missed opportunities of scientific and technical cooperation between the two superpowers during the period of relative thaw, the latter focus on studying the U.S. trade policy, but the transfer of technologies and high-tech products is considered in the context of discriminatory restrictions caused by the logic of the Cold War. While Russian authors, as a rule, emphasize the equal and mutually beneficial nature of cooperation in the scientific and technical sphere, American and European historians point to the USSR lagging behind in the development and introduction of new technologies into production by the mid-1970s, a greater interest in cooperation and, as a result, a more vulnerable position in the negotiation and bargaining.

AB When Alexander Dynkin took up the position of Director of IMEMO in 2006, he had a clear program of action. The main point of this program was the transformation of the Institute into a modern world-class think tank, capable of deeply and objectively analyzing the processes of world development and the current situation. This was possible only on the basis of fundamental scientific research. Another task was to raise the prestige of IMEMO in public opinion, in the media space and in government bodies. Finally, the new director intended to attract talented young people to the Institute. Acting in this direction, the Academician A. Dynkin initiated a number of structural changes in IMEMO, aimed at optimizing scientific and scientific-organizational work. With designation of Alexander Dynkin as Director, the volume of expert-analytical notes and materials sent to the Administration of the President of Russia, the Security Council, the Government of the Russian Federation, to the relevant committees of the State Duma, ministries and departments has sharply increased. In 2007, the Institute sent a total of 65 analytical notes and materials to these bodies (38 in 2006), which served the purpose of the new Director to restore IMEMO's position as Russia's leading center of expertise in the field of modern world development. All these materials were prepared in reliance on a thorough analysis of the strategic, political and economic realities, providing for the national interests of Russia, which, as historical experience shows, do not always coincide with corporate interests of the ruling elite.

AB Russia occupies one of the leading places in the world encyclopedic studies, being the owner of many major encyclopedic editions, the uniqueness of which was manifested, first of all, in their content and thematic diversity of material. The relevance of studying the history of the creation of encyclopedic editions in Russia is due to the need to systematize the experience of Russian encyclopedic studies in order to identify trends and prospects of its development. The history of the formation of Soviet encyclopedic studies has not received the full coverage. There are no generalizing theoretical works on the history of domestic encyclopedic editions; systemic studies of methodological nature have not been conducted. Only a general analysis of the structural features of individual encyclopedias of the Soviet period has been made. The main methodological foundation of scientific research on the study of the history of encyclopedic editions in the USSR and its role in the development of the Russian encyclopedic business traditionally are the principles of historicism and objectivity. The comparative-historical method made it possible to identify the general and specific in the development of encyclopedic business in the Soviet encyclopedias. The retrospective method allowed considering the historical prerequisites for the formation of the phenomenon. When analyzing historical material, it is also necessary to rely on the systemic approach, which consists in the holistic consideration of a set of objects. The documents of the Russian State Historical Archive and materials of the periodical press became the information base for the preparation of the article. In the Soviet state, a new understanding of reality and society's access to knowledge was being formed in a new way, where encyclopedias became an emblem representing a new social order based on the monopoly of knowledge and power. The aim of this publication is to represent the process of the formation and development of encyclopedias in the USSR. Based on the materials of the fonds of the State Archive of the Russian Federation and the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History, as well as periodicals, the evolution of encyclopedic studies in the USSR is presented. The conclusions are drawn, which give an opportunity to show in a new way the peculiarities of the formation of encyclopedic work in the USSR as an ideological phenomenon, which still remains a valuable heritage that preserves the memory of our country and our people. The Soviet period can be considered the era of laying the foundations of a new system of encyclopedias, when the necessary internal prerequisites for the development of the encyclopedic work were created, combined with the influence of external factors. The works of Soviet scientists of the 20th century reflected the formation of the encyclopedic paradigm as an integral part of Soviet culture. This paradigm was subsequently embodied in the work of scientists at the beginning of the 21st century.

ID EMOTIONS
AB Nowadays the study of language interaction within the discursive paradigm is gaining increasing popularity. Thus, a description of such types of discourse as political, media, advertising, etc. has been widely developed. A special area of research is devoted to works on the characteristics of academic discourse (including the foreign one) due to the fact that the processes of globalization, academic mobility of professors and students determine the increasing role of academic language as a means of accumulating and transmitting scientific experience. The article provides a linguodidactic characteristic of academic discourse. The aim of this study is to determine the degree of formation of mediation skills in postgraduate students of a multidisciplinary university while working with general scientific texts. The study was conducted at Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University in 2023. The participants of the study were students in non-linguistic areas of training, N=67, with a language proficiency level of B2+ on the CEFR scale. To reach the aim, a test of 9 tasks was compiled. The tasks were developed based on the indicators of mediative competence presented in the CEFR for level B2 and included 6 general scientific texts in English on various topics ("Bird Migration", "Petroleum Resources", "Crows Count on 'Number Neurons'", "Radon", "Cave Art in Europe", "Minerals and Plants"). The results of the study showed that only 10% of postgraduate students successfully completed all tasks. Students demonstrated the ability to summarize and convey significant information in a foreign language, structure text fragments, adapt and simplify source material, express their own point of view regarding what they read, and provide a high-quality translation without distorting the meaning of the source text. The majority of students - 60% - do not have the skills of mediating general scientific texts to a degree corresponding to their level of language proficiency. The key difficulties that students faced were related to the interpretation and generalization of semantic dominants of the source text (in particular those with metaphorical meaning) as well as to the correct lexical building of statements (the search for lexical substitutions and equivalents during translation) and to the analysis of the logical and structural organization of general scientific texts. This allows concluding that the formation of mediation skills should be of an intentional nature. Moreover, it should be based on a systematic and methodologically appropriate model of teaching foreign language academic discourse.

AB This article reveals the concept of an intellectual environment as a community of people aimed at creating an intellectual and creative product and connected by a certain communication field. This community is considered as a cumulative subject of production of an innovative product, as a part of the public space, responsible for the production, exchange, distribution and reproduction of intellectual resources. The article provides an overview of existing approaches and concepts used to study this phenomenon, such as "epistemic community," "intellectual milieu," "knowledge society," "Information society," "knowledge economy", "free-floating intelligentsia", "human capital", "intellectual capital", etc. The basic factors contributing to the effective development of the intellectual environment are considered: socio-political, economic, communicative, and socio-cultural. Particular attention is paid to the specifics of the Russian tradition of the formation of the intellectual environment, revealing the discontinuous and nonlinear type of its evolution both in relation to the global intellectual environment and in relation to its own intellectual roots and tradition. The specific dual nature of the intellectual field of Russia, associated with the peculiarities of the process of its modernization, is emphasized. In conclusion, the idea is expressed about two possible vectors for the development of the global intellectual environment: segmental and integrative, as an important dilemma of modern international politics.

AB Introduction. The risks of destabilization of the ethno-political and ethno-confessional situation in the North Caucasus, active migration processes, as well as traditional for this macro -region socio-economic problems and issues of inter -ethnic relations actualize the state policy of identity at the level of regions and the country as a whole. One of the mechanisms for strengthening the Russian national identity is regional branding. The purpose of the study is to analyze the perceptions of the region's uniqueness, values, levels of identity of the population of Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria and Dagestan, to find common meanings and values for the regions, which, reflected in brands, are included in the state identity policy, strengthening its national level. Materials and Methods. Empirical materials include quantitative data from a mass survey conducted in October -November 2023 in Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria and Dagestan, and qualitative (non -standardized interviews with experts). The methodological design is based on the use of an interdisciplinary approach and comparative analysis of cases from the three regions. This allowed us to identify common and special features in determining the potential of branding to strengthen the Russian national identity, based on the principle of triangulation. Results. The peculiarities and key characteristics of the regions under study have been identified. It was found that there is no integral established brand of the region in them, but the sources of its formation are obvious - the residents' perceptions of the uniqueness of the region and the markers by which the residents identify themselves with it. In Adygea and Kabardino-Balkaria it is a high level of comfort with the preservation of ethnic traditions, in Dagestan it is the significant role of religion and ethnic traditions, active orientation of residents to entrepreneurial activity. Discussions and Conclusions. Regional identity is formed around unique unifying features - the value of preserving ethnic traditions and good -neighborly relations, the absence of interethnic conflicts, identification markers common to the three regions (attitude to the native land, nature, territory, the value of cultural traditions, language). The reliance on these values in the process of branding the regions provides a link to national identity through the meanings and values common to all regions. The obtained results may be of interest to regional authorities and contribute to the inclusion of regional branding tasks in the policy of strengthening national identity.

AB The study analyzes the process of electrification of the Far East as an integral part of the mobilization model of the USSR's economic development in the late 1920s - mid-1940s and reveals the regional features of its implementation. The methodological basis of the study is traditional historical methods, as well as the method of systems analysis, which allows considering the electrification of the Far East as an element of the economic system of the USSR. The work is based on a corpus of unpublished sources identified in the funds of federal and regional archives. A study of the literature on the problem has shown that certain material has been accumulated on it, but a more in-depth analysis of electrification processes in the parameters of the mobilization model can contribute to the solution of the fundamental scientific task of recreating a holistic picture of the transformations that took place in the regional economy in the late 1920s - mid-1940s The main part of the work shows that in the mobilization model, the processes of electrification of the Far East were entirely concentrated in the hands of the state, subordinated to the general tasks of creating an industrial economy and strengthening the country's defense capability. To implement the mobilization model, plans were developed for the electrification of the region, based on economic, political and military-strategic factors of increasing the defense capability of the eastern regions of the country and their integration into the all-Union space. In the Far East, unlike the western regions of the country, the necessary energy infrastructure was initially lacking, capacity reserves were not created according to the GOELRO plan, and there was not enough time and resources for large-scale energy construction and the implementation of five-year plans. The mobilization nature of the accelerated development of productive forces in the region determined the decentralized departmental path of development of the electric power industry. As a result, there was a sharp gap between the growth rates of the industrial economy of the region and the electric power industry, which by the beginning of the Great Patriotic War developed into an energy crisis. This gap turned into one of the main problems of the region's economic development, which the state, despite all further efforts and investments aimed at electrification, was not able to solve until the end of the Soviet era.

AB The correct understanding of the current world political agenda associated with changes in the global agrifood system is accompanied by the development of new analytical models. The present work is also devoted to the study of the "Land Grabbing" concept as one of innovative tools of the theoretical apparatus of political science. Using the method of historical and logical unity, the author evaluates the role of the "Land Grabbing" strategy, in comparison with "Double Movement" theory and the typology of international food regimes. In particular, the article is devoted to the study of the stages of emergence and evolution of this concept, unfamiliar to the Russian academic community. Based on a comparative analysis, all theories used to describe the expropriation of ecosystem resources are compared. As a result of the procedure, the compilation feature of all related concepts is diagnosed, and the hidden discursive disagreement is eliminated. Using the method of critical analysis, the author develops a "Two-phase model of the occupation of control", which emphasizes the dominant position of the Conflict paradigm - the semantic module of the idea of "Land Grabbing". In the experimental part of the article, the effectiveness of the "Land Grabbing" concept is verified on a specific example - the agricultural sector of the Russian Federation. Via the method of statistical observation, the author analyzes the dynamics of property rights and systematizes the register of commercial contracts concluded with agricultural land in the period from 2000 to 2023. It is proved that foreign corporations are the ultimate beneficiaries in more than 90% of cases of all land transactions. Relying on the method of secondary data analysis, the author identifies the largest commercial owners of agricultural land and the leading countries in offshore exploitation of the general domestic ecosystem resource. By the visualization method, a "Tree-factor model of Land Grabbing" is constructed, the indicators of which are the processes of Corporatization, Foreignization and Catastrophization. In the final part of the work, the author simulates a predictive scenario for the transformation of the global food system based on a retrospective analysis of international food regimes. At the same time, a legal examination of the strategy for national security of the Russian Federation is conducted. Drawing on the analysis performed, the author formulates recommendations relevant to the current geopolitical situation.

AB Russian Studies as an established discipline has been continuously evolving for over a century, with American socio-political and area studies delving into various faces of Russian reality. This article delves into the origins of Russian Studies in the United States, its unique methodological characteristics, and offers a periodization framework by the writer, highlighting the developmental phases of the discipline over the past century. It's worth noting that Russian Studies is an interdisciplinary field of academic endeavor that brings together insights from diverse areas within the social and humanities sciences. The article also addresses the challenge of delineating the subject matter of this discipline and the development of research approaches for studying Russia, particularly within the historical context of the last half of the 20th century. There's a specific focus on nurturing the growth of academic and expert talent: specialists in Russian Studies and Sovietology. In this regard, the article posits the idea that Soviet Studies carries practical political-ideological and political-technological significance. It has emerged as a pivotal mental force shaping public opinion and influencing the decision-making processes of American elites during the Cold War era. The article concludes by examining the contemporary challenges and prospects facing Russian Studies. It primarily concentrates on the present state of "Russian Studies," encompassing its theoretical underpinnings, empirical research, and intellectual dimensions. This occurs in the context of the evolving public discourse about Russia within the United States and the significant deterioration of American-Russian relations.

   foundations; sociological approach; domestic sociology
AB Destructive behavior, being the object of interdisciplinary analysis, is studied from the point of view of a proper, normatively conditioned socio-psychological action, which has its own grounds for reproduction and transmission at the individual, group, and community levels. The aim of the article is to consider a sociological retrospective of the socio-political foundations for the study of destructive behavior. The research framework provides for a combination and retrospective analysis of the socio-political foundations of destructive features in traditional (sociobiological, socioenergetic, socio-territorial approaches) and modern (organizational-management, polyparadigmatic approaches, centaur-problems and precarity) Russian practice. The approaches proposed by domestic sociologists of various periods of the historical development of Russia are considered. The views on destructive manifestations within the scientific approaches of Russian sociologists V.M. Bekhterev, P.A. Sorokin, D.A. Dril, E.V. De Roberti, M.M. Kovalevsky, Soviet researchers A.A. Bogdanov, A.K. Gastev, L.N. Kogan, as well as modern Russian sociologists O.N. Yanitsky, S.A. Kravchenko and Zh.T. Toshchenko, A and a number of others are generalized. A These approaches in their empirical results substantiate destructive behavior in a certain historical period of social and political development, and remain relevant and in demand for the research community at the present time. The described sociological approaches and concepts make it possible to identify complex social and political markers-indicators of destructive behavior. In particular, the following are distinguished: the dominant forms of social interaction "disenchantment of the world", sustainable civic interest in resonant socio-political events, purposefulness of destructiveness, negative energy, cumulative effect of destructive activities, etc. Practices of manifestation of destructiveness in everyday life and in the modern perspective (projection for the future) are proposed. The described approaches in their content accumulate methods of borrowing destructive practices implemented at various levels of social and political interaction, in a localized and vast space, in individual-personal and collective fields. A new perspective for the development of the study of the social and political foundations of destructive behavior is digitalization of network relations and the possibilities of using a digital virtual environment with many metastructures and mediators of continuous communication operating 24/7 on data-mining platforms, and artificial intelligence (AI).

DE transformative agency; civic consciousness of youth; civic participation

AB Introduction. The relevance of the study is associated with the need for the formation of civic consciousness among the young generation. It is important to create mechanisms for involving young people in active creative activity through volunteering and constructive political activity. In the current conditions, it is necessary to restructure the consciousness and correct the behaviour of young people by creating certain conditions for prosocial activity, mutual assistance and support for those who need it especially. Aim. The aim of the article is to assess the real practices and potential of civic participation of students in the Sverdlovsk region, identifying the sociocultural features of civic consciousness of high school students and students through the prism of their transformative agency and identifying the con - ditions of the educational environment for the expansion of youth prosocial activity in the interests of territorial development. Methodology and research methods . The methodological basis of the article is a set of theoretical ide - as about the transforming agency of youth and the formation of socially responsible behaviour of young Russians as citizens of their country, region, and city of residence. The theory of civic consciousness has received a certain development in the article. The present article is based on the materials of the authors' research project implemented in 2022 in the Sverdlovsk region. The authors analysed the data of a mass survey of young people in the Sverdlovsk region from 14 to 24 years old from 79 settlements of the region, carried out by the questionnaire method. 996 people were interviewed, the sample is representative, the error is no more than 3,5%. There are four quotas in its base: gender, age, main type of education (school, secondary school, university); type of city by population. The data of the quantitative survey are supple - mented by the results of the analysis of social youth projects that received government support at the regional level in the subsidy competition of the Ministry of Education and Youth Policy of the Sverdlovsk Region in 2022-2023. Results and scientific novelty. The study demonstrated that the educational environment is designed and creates conditions for the acquisition of civic experience by young students today. On the one hand, projects, actions, information events should be called for the formation of civic consciousness in the development of transformative agency of youth. On the other hand, they should give young people the opportunity to realise and develop their transformative agency as citizens of their country, residents of their city through reflection, initiative, plans aimed at solving urgent social problems, and their imple - mentation. Systematic work to create conditions for this in educational institutions should help comple - ment the organisation of passive civic participation with mechanisms that help young Russians realise their active civic position, stimulate them to take real actions in the socio-political sphere. The study proves that civic experience and civic subjectivity, which manifests itself in various practices of civic participation, accumulates and is formed among young people depending on age. This is less expressed in high school students, and more expressed in university students. University students are more subjec - tive; they do not just formally use resources for civic engagement, but try to accumulate civic knowledge with their help, consciously showing interest and intention in the sphere of such activity.
   The conditions of the environment of civic participation in the education system largely determine the differences in the subjective value characteristics of high school students and university students, revealing the transform - ative agency in the development of their civic consciousness. Practical significance . Considering the geopolitical challenges in Russian education today, the issue of implementing educational work with young people is acute. Given the special characteristics of the civic activity of Russian youth for the organisation of social work with high school students and uni - versity students, it is important to understand the potential of civic activity of the young generation, especially those characteristics possessed by the socially active part of schoolchildren and students for correcting the course of regional youth policy and improving the mechanisms of government support for youth projects in the education system.

AB The article reconstructs the biography of the emigrant historian Leonid Ivanovich Strakhovsky (1898-1963), a nephew of M.I. Rostovtzeff - the son of his younger sister Tatiana (1875-?) and the Senator Ivan Mikhailovich Strakhovsky (1866-1921) who was shot by the Bolsheviks in the 'Tagantsev conspiracy' trial. After graduating from the Alexander Lyceum (1913-1917), Leonid Strakhovsky entered the Petrograd University (1917-1918), but had to interrupt his studies because of the revolutions and the Civil War. The young man joined the White Movement and in 1920 fled into exile first to London and then to Berlin; since 1922 he started writing poems under the pseudonym of "Leonid Chatsky". After graduating from the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium (1924-1928), he received a Doctorate in History, and started teaching as a professor of Russian history. In the late 1920s, Leonid Strakhovsky moved to the United States where he became a lecturer in the political and diplomatic history of Europe (1928), professor of modern European history at Georgetown University in Washington (1936), professor of European history at the University of Maryland (1937-1942), and taught Russian language and literature at Harvard (1943- 1948). Having moved to Canada, he became a professor of Russian history and literature in the Department of Slavic Studies at the University of Toronto (1950-1963). In 1953 he published the memoirs 'Uncle Misha' about M.I. Rostovtzeff, in the Paris newspaper Russian Thought, telling the story of his meetings with M.I. Rostovtzeff both in Petrograd and in exile. The memoirs have been practically unknown in Russia ever since. Now the article presents their complete text with a commentary.

AB The article deals with the main directions and outcomes of identity research along with the expansion of the research field as a whole and concept list. The author explores an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach well established in identitarian research. By building a general outline and defining the comparative context of the analysis of identity in general and political identity in particular, the article explores collective monographs "Integration and disintegration potential of identity in history and modernity" and "Identity. Personality, society politics. New contours of the research field". The interdisciplinary work of Tomsk scientists is structured into three parts, corresponding to the author's methodology. This approach enables to characterize the key positions of the authors of each part, comparing them with the arsenal developed in the social and humanities. Scientific and political relevance characterize each of the dimensions chosen by the authors of the monograph, which also determines the high disputability of the proposed topics and assessments. The collective monograph edited by Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences I.S. Semenenko has 44 sections written by a team of 32 authors. The article contains an overview of key sections and directions of research, and notes the role of the executive editor, who is one of the leaders of identitarian research in modern Russia. The collective monograph is aimed at promoting the issue of identity not only in scientific discussions, but also in the public space, since identity is considered as an important development resource. Despite all the differences in format, structure, objectives and approaches, these works are united by bringing identity into the mainstream of sociohumanitarian and political science, determining the potential of identity as a resource for social development, integration (or disintegration) of the society. Analysis of the research conducted gives grounds to attribute them to the successful search for an independent vector of domestic science.

AB The article analyzes the main trends in the transformation of the political party system of the European Union on the eve of the next European Parliament election, which will be held in June 2024. Long-term trends include: a decrease in the popularity of traditional political parties - conservatives, social democrats and liberals - in most EU member states; an increase in electoral support for populist parties in the same countries; an increase in the representation of women in EU authorities; strengthening the pan-European political space, which leads to deepened impact of EU political institutions on the political systems of EU member states, etc. Relatively new trends in the transformation of this system are: growing popularity and influence of Eurosceptic parties both in individual European countries and in the European Union as a whole; political conflict between the EU and its member states - Poland and Hungary which violate European democratic principles, including the rule of law with respect to the rights of citizens and the independence of the judicial branch of government. The author scrutinises the influence of changes in the socio-class structure of European society on these processes, which occur partly owing to a visible reduction in the number of the industrial proletariat. It is noted that the consequences of these changes are the destruction of the boundary between the traditional right and left parties, and the death of many classical ideological categories. The study also presents the forecast of results of the leading pan-European political parties' participation in the 2024 European election, made by a number of European non-governmental organizations and mainstream media holdings following public opinion polls, as well as their possible impact on the formation of a new composition of the European Parliament and the European Commission.

AB In the article, using the example of editions of Ch. Perrault examines the peculiarities of publishing fairy tales for children as an indicator of the refraction of the traditional concept of children's books in tsarist Russia and changes in publishing policy in connection with the formation of new pedagogical and literary and artistic trends. The study is based on scientific methods, such as observation, bibliographic heuristics, historiographic, comparative-historical analysis. Editions of fairy tales by Sh. Perrault, as an object of research, is considered in the historical development of Soviet book publishing, which acted under the influence of ideological factors and social conditions that determined the subject matter, types of publications, their translations and design. The features of the stages of development of children's book publishing are characterized from the point of view of pedagogical and publishing priorities, the competencies of translators and artists, indirectly influencing printing resources. The subject area of the study includes modern editions of fairy tales by Sh. Perrault in the form of separate and special issues addressed to children with different reading abilities and aesthetic perception. The history of the publication of Charles Perrault's fairy tales is analyzed as a new type of publication that correspond to general political attitudes that make them legitimate for the perception of a children's reader. The article highlights the publications characteristic of each stage, which have developed under the influence of discussions about the combination of traditional and innovative views on the functions of a children's book: from edifying and moralizing to soviet propaganda and modern cultural and educational.

AB Modern security studies actualize the problem of terrorism. It is multidimensional and requires careful study, taking into account the time and space of a particular State. Considering terrorism as a concrete historical phenomenon contributes to the preservation of historical and genetic continuity. Using the experience of countering it will ensure the security of the state and society. The aim of the work is to identify the specifics of the attitude towards terrorism in the Russian Empire at the turn of the XIX-XX centuries on the part of the state authorities and society. The methodological basis of the study was the political-historical approach. It is used to reconstruct the domestic political situation and transform legislation. The historical-genetic method made it possible to identify the conditions of spread and development of terrorist sentiments in time. The idiographic method reveals the impact of individual cases on the situation as a whole. Terrorism is considered within the framework of social constructivism. The roles of all participants are indicated. The authors note the emerging trend towards the glorification of terrorists among the population and the positioning of their actions by terrorists as acts of martyrdom. The noted favorable conditions for the spread of terrorism were caused by systemic errors of the State authorities. The first mistakes were in the absence of an appropriate legislative norm separating terrorism from other types of crimes. The second is ignoring the social nature of terrorism caused by post-reform changes. As a result, the comprehensive approach necessary for constructive counteraction to terrorism has not been developed. The police measures of detection, prevention and supervision used were not effective, and in some cases even contributed to the spread of anti-government ideas to remote territories of the empire.

AB The paper discusses the main results of the development of maritime spatial planning (MSP) in the European Union by 2023. The study aims to evaluate the experience and developments of the EU in this specific area. Methodologically the analysis is based on regulatory documents, which establish the requirements of the MSP for its coastal member countries. Information from official EU sources on specialised projects and programs has been studied and summarised. The author drew a number of conclusions complementing the latest Russian research in the field of modern marine management. It is argued that by now the EU has created conditions for the planning of certain marine areas for various types of marine activities, provided political, institutional, financial, information, and communication support for such actions. At the same time, the EU is largely focused on cross-border cooperation. An important result for the EU was the organisational factor, within which the management contour of the MSP processes for individual territorial administrative units (country, marine region/subregion, European Union) is being built. The proven algorithms provide the EU with the opportunity to become one of the main global actors that regulate the promotion of MSP technologies in various areas of the World's ocean.

The author considers the three most affected sectors of the economy of Sri Lanka: agriculture, the textile and apparel industry and tourism. All of them in their present form are products of the modern era, formed under the influence of colonial and neo-colonial practices and provided Sri Lanka with a specific place in the world economic system as a producer of plantation crops (primarily tea), textiles of the upper price segment and tourism services, focused on the EU and the US population. During the pandemic, the orientation on the Western market, aggravated by the voluntaristic actions of the country's leading the Rajapaksa clan, led to the collapse of key sectors of the Sri Lankan economy. Particular attention is paid to the agrarian sector. The author believes that the current disparities in the agrarian development of Sri Lanka are the result of the colonial past. The issue of mending these imbalances was politicized during the civil war (1983-200 9), and as a way out, the concept of developing organic farming, itself a product of Western cultural hegemony, was proposed. The author notes that instead of admitting partial responsibility for the crisis, the Western media are inclined to blame China for Sri Lanka's problems. The PRC is believed to have deliberately driven the island into a debt trap. It is assumed that developing countries should solve the problems of Sri Lanka, while it is clear that Western countries will derive the main benefit from the recovery of its economy and return to world production chains.

AB Digitalization of modern society has caused extreme reforms in the information sphere. The education system has not been spared. The problem of lifelong learning and constant moral development of the specialists, ready to critical and creative solving of professional tasks, is getting more topical. For contemporary specialists the presence of digital intercultural competencies is an essential part of their professiograms. Due to requirements for the pedagogical concept and the principles of solving scientific problems it's necessary to analyze historical and pedagogical background in the field of digital intercultural competence. Historical and pedagogical analysis is determined by etymological complexity and multidimensional nature of the research problem, the absence of clear historical boundaries of the phenomenon, digitalization of social and business processes, expansion of intercultural contacts between different nations. Every period of historical development was analyzed from the political and socio-economical viewpoints. The whole investigation was carried out since the advent of information theory till the emergence of theory of intercultural communication. Historical and pedagogical analysis of the researched problem was carried out from beginning of XX century to the present day, because this period is associated with a significant change in social and scientific spheres, that demonstrate the dynamics of the phenomenon of digital intercultural competence objectively. Crucial impact on the rash development of the pedagogical phenomenon of the digital intercultural competence has played socio-economical digitalization of the contemporary world, which determined the increased interest of the government and employers in the necessity of developing digital competencies and increasing of the Russian science' competitiveness in the world. The investigation was carried out between first -year students of the training direction 45.03.02 Linguistics (bachelor's degree). The linguistic direction of training was chosen consciously because of the direct connection of intercultural interaction with a foreign language and linguistic training.

AB The modern political science requires taking into account the influence of traditions, cultural and historical characteristics of society on political processes and political systems of different countries. Under these conditions, identity and tradition get back the right to direct political expression. Concepts that explain the state of society primarily from the point of view of cultural and historical factors are usually called civilization theories. The article aims at describing the foundations of the Russian-Byzantine cultural-historical type and its relationship with the Western European one. Scientific approaches to revealing the logic of interaction between cultural- historical and political-economic factors have been identified, and a method of world-system analysis has been proposed complementarily. It is concluded that stable political institutions in Russia have always been shaped under the influence of deep cultural and historical processes. During those periods when this pattern gave way to a mechanical choice of political institutional forms, crisis processes grew in society. In the twentieth century, a similar situation led to the emergence of the phenomenon of a "divided people" and a crisis of national identity. Society today is forced to overcome the far-reaching consequences of this crisis in the format of the special military operation.

DT Article
DE Arctic; Chukotka; agitreis; agitation; mobility; changing materiality
AB The article examines a unique phenomenon of the Soviet era - the socalled agitreis. These were marches through the coastal Chukotka villages, which pursued the usual goal for a Soviet citizen, a person of that time - political educational work among the newcomers and indigenous population of the Chukotka Peninsula. Agitreises combined mobile and stationary in a special way. Soviet correspondents, photographers, and representatives of the local creative intelligentsia took part in the propaganda campaigns. The authors reveal the essence of this Soviet-era phenomenon through the example of a specific agitreis, which took place in the summer of 1985, and passed along the coast of Chukotka on the ship "Captain Sotnikov" from Anadyr to Uelen. Using a microhistorical approach, the authors propose to look at the events through the lens and memories of direct participants of the agitreis in Chukotka - photographers N.N. Bobrov and V.V. Sertun. The article reconstructs the route, participants and key events of the Chukotka agitreis of 1985. This agitreis performed not only the function of informing, but also allowed for operational monitoring of the processes and changes taking place in Chukotka. The cruise participants had the opportunity to compare the progress of the village improvement process, find out plans for the future, understand the local context and identify specific problems.

DE stress resilience; EU; ASEAN; stress resilience tools
AB This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the concept of stress resilience from a legal point of view, focusing on the role of this concept in ensuring the security and foreign policy of states and international associations. In this direction, it is important to find a balance between the normative component and the political context of the term "stress resilience". Against the background of the processes of fragmentation and polarisation taking place in the modern world, the analysis of stress resilience practices developed by integration associations over decades may lead to the stabilisation of the common system. For Russia this seems particularly relevant in the context of increasing international tensions and popularisation of discriminatory measures. The main objective of the study is to examine, analyse and compare in detail the main legal instruments used to ensure stress resilience in the context of two key structures - the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the main trend in this area was to focus on external challenges and threats. However, the pandemic has forced international actors and states to rethink their strategies and priorities, focusing on domestic issues and challenges. The authors of the article offer their vision of new resilience models for the EU and ASEAN, which are envisaged to be the basis for further effective functioning and development of these integration groupings. The study also highlights that within the framework of integration processes, enhancing sustainability has attracted the attention of various countries and international organisations. In light of the current global transformations, the world is facing the most serious economic challenges, which opens new opportunities for research and development of new strategies for sustainability in the future. Thus, this study represents an important contribution to understanding the role of legal mechanisms in ensuring stress resilience, as well as to the development of effective strategies for overcoming the challenges and threats facing states and international associations in the modern world. A stress -resilient state is a secure state, and security promotes prosperity and democracy, the rule of law and human rights. Based on the theoretical foundations of political neoliberalism, this study reflects the current problems and challenges faced by modern legal systems and international organisations.

AB This article delves into the complex dynamics of Vietnam's democratization process, highlighting the simultaneous influences of international integration and advancements in science and technology. This study investigates the impact of Vietnam's increasing involvement in the global economy and international community, as well as its adoption of technological advancements, on the country's path toward democratization. The study utilizes a mixed approach, blending qualitative analysis of scientific documents, Vietnamese government policies, and quantitative data on the democracy index from international organizations. It identifies international integration as a doubleedged sword: on one hand, it boosts economic growth and development, driving the democratic transition process forward; on the other hand, it also leads to economic dependence and inequality, potentially impeding democratic reform. The findings of this study show that the rapid progress of science and technology, especially information and communication technology, presents both opportunities and difficulties for Vietnam's democratic process. It provides unparalleled opportunities for widespread involvement in political activities and the spread of democratic principles, but it also carries the risk of social unrest and the potential for the authoritarian state to control and manipulate information.

AB The article refers on the legal obligations imposed by the international community on the Greek government by the Treaty concerning the protection of minorities in Greece signed at Sevres on August 10, 1920. The provisions of Articles 7, 8, 9 regulated the rights of the numerous Macedonian Slavic population living in Macedonian lands ceded to Greece as a result of the Balkan wars of 1912-1913. The treaty was ratified by the Greek government on the 30th th of October 1923 but has never been implemented. The Greek authorities introduced a whole list of restrictive measures. The Slavic surnames of local Macedonian population were changed to Greek as well as geographic names. Slavic inscriptions in churches and monasteries were erased, a ban was introduced on the performance of folk songs and the use of the Macedonian language even in the private life of citizens of Greek Macedonia etc. As a result of the Greek government assimilation policy and demographic and migration shift in the Aegean Macedonia in accordance with the Treaty of Neuilly from 1919 and Treaty of Lausanne from 1923, the Slavic cultural and linguistic space in Greece in fact has been erased. Similar processes in relation to the Slavic - Serbian and Macedonian population previously occurred in other parts of the Southern Balkans, in Kosovo and Metohia, are currently intensifying in North Macedonia and southern Serbia. This leads not only to aggravation of the problem from an ethnocultural point of view, but also opens the path to transforming the political space of the South Slavic countries in the future.

DT Article
DE spatial effects; diffusion of innovations; separatism; regional parties;
   regionalism; Europe
ID REGIONALIST PARTIES; SPACE
AB According to Ryan Griffiths, we're in the "Age of Secession". The characteristics of spatial effects typical of Eupopean separatism are consistently examined in this paper. The effects of diffusion, proximity, fragmentation, and scale are given special consideration. The space is not homogeneous; separatism erupts with the most vulnerable territories, takes different forms, and has different pace. Since the diffusion effect undoubtedly contributes to the fragmentation of the political space, it takes on distinct forms depending on the historical period. It would be incorrect to claim that separatist movements arise in response to geographic distance only. Social proximity determines spatial influence. Instead, the degree to which separatist actors interact with one another is determined by their territorial proximity. With scale of political activity changing, the correspondent extent, to which political actors influence them, varies as well. As a result, regionalist parties that are not well-known at the federal level play a significant role in local politics. Due to the fragmentation effect, the number of these parties is increasing at the regional level, yet not nationwide. Given the scale effect, regional actors in the EU can interact with supranational structures themselves and gain more power without having to go through national ones. There are more parties with a territorial profile as a result of spatial effects in politics. Political leaders and parties at the national level are compelled to consider their stances, incorporate the regional agenda into their plans, and frequently pursue partnerships with them.

DE COVID-19 pandemic; economic and political aspects; vaccines development;

AB In March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus has reached the stage of a pandemic. With over 700 million cases of the disease and close to 7 million deaths recorded through May 2023 it turned out to have become the most disastrous pandemic after the Spanish flu of 1918- 1919. It had a severe impact on all spheres of human life. In addition to having caused a huge stress of the public health care systems, it affected the functioning of the political and economic systems of all countries. This paper provides an analysis of economic and political consequences of the pandemic, gives an overview of its human toll, and discusses the unresolved issue of SARS-CoV-2 origin. The economic consequences of the pandemic, including reduction in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), trade and travel, growth in unemployment rate, etc. were quite significant. Political aspects included the ability of the countries' leadership to provide a justified, solid and well-coordinated response to the threat as well as trust in the activities of a government on behalf of citizens. Not all politicians were able to meet the high standards of performance in the emergency situation. Unwillingness of western countries to acknowledge the efficacy of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine is an example of political and economic controversies between states. The probability of the occurrence of similar pandemics in the future is rather high. Utilizing the lessons learned from the COVID-19, scaling up the investments in the diseases surveillance and response systems, in hospital preparedness as well as in scientific research and vaccines development along with international cooperation, transparency and information sharing between countries on the above issues is crucial for facilitating the pandemic response in the future and avoiding the challenges encountered during the COVID-19 crisis of 2020-2023.

AB Karnataka has become the first and only state in South India where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has ever won Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha) elections and come to power. Moreover, in four general elections from 2004 to 2019, the party won a majority of the total of twenty-eight Karnataka's parliamentary seats. Thus, the state is known as a stronghold of the saffron party in South India, which has a rather significant impact on the national political landscape and the balance of power in Delhi. The article examines ethnocultural, linguistic, socioeconomic, and political specifics of South India as a whole and covers the key moments and the main causes of the BJP's rise in Karnataka. It also scrutinizes the party's methods of social engineering. These include building of electorally successful social coalitions, winning over dominant caste groups and local political leaders as well as political mobilization based on Hindutva, inter alia through disputes over sacred sites important for both Hindus and Muslims, campaigns against religious conversions, "hindutvatisation" of education, etc. Furthermore, the article examines whether and to what extent these methods are effective in Karnataka and may be replicable in other southern states. The article also investigates the causes of the BJP's defeat by the Indian National Congress in Karnataka Vidhan Sabha election in May 2023. The author concludes that despite this failure the BJP has not completely lost the state as a springboard in South India, from where it plans to spread its influence to the rest of the region, and remains the majority party in the country and the frontrunner in the general election to be held in 2024.

AB Suffrage by citizens of the Russian Empire was realized at the beginning of the twentieth century. Among the elected to the Duma were non-Kazakhs. The source base of the study of parliamentarians and their political careers: scientist Bukeikhanov and Mullah Kosshygulov - archived materials of the former State Duma and the press of Russia of the early twentieth century. The topic is poorly covered in historical literature, since both deputies were victims of Soviet repression. The authors studied the sources from the funds of the RGAKFFD, RGIA (Russian Federation), TCC DAB OAK (Turkey), the Central State Archive of Kazakhstan (Kazakhstan). Methods of dialectical logic, analysis and synthesis, retrospection, verification and reconstructing little-known aspects of the all-Russian political process were used. Although the educational qualifications of Bukeikhanov (secular) and Kosshygulov (Islamic) differed, as did their lifestyle, both deputies took seriously the possibility of determining the fate of the people in the high rank of Duma members. There were curious parallels between the public activity of deputies during the period under study, in the context of international relations. Kosshygulov visited the Ottoman Empire. The self-identification of the people's deputies did not go beyond the scope of Russian citizenship.

AB This article aims at identifying the phenomenon of interethnic division of labor in Volhynia. Based on the 1897 census data, the authors prove that though the interethnic division of labor, based on different ways of life support for ethnic groups, was essential for the eastern regions of the empire, it was an insignificant phenomenon for Volhynia. The 1897 census recorded a total of 2,989,482 people in the province, including 703,477 economically active persons and 2,286,005 persons living at their expense. The main occupation in the province was agriculture, which ensured the expanded reproduction of the workforce: 407,215 (57.9% of all those employed in the national economy) independent farmers provided for themselves and 1,812,773 family members (dependents), or in other words, one fed another 4.5 people. Farmers covered the shortage of personnel in other industries in both rural and urban areas. In addition to agriculture, 74,952 (10.7%) were engaged in industry, 63,956 (9.1%) in services, 42,002 (6.0%) in trade, and 9,195 (1.3%) in transport. 5,329 people or 0.8% of all workers were employed in regional administration, and 8,446 or 1.2 % - in cultural institutions, education, science, and medical care; 6,088 people or about 0.9 % in religious cults, 49,793 people or 7.1% of all employed in the armed forces. By the end of the 19th century, the interethnic division of labor in Volhynia was formed as a result of political and economic factors. The Slavic, Turkic, and German population had similar employment structures, with agriculture predominant. Germans, Czechs, and Belarusians were poorly integrated into the urban community. Little Russians, who made up 2,095,579 people, that is, the majority of the population of the province, played secondary roles in the cities, numbering 46,060 people or about 20% of the city dwellers. Jews, limited in their ability to engage in agriculture, made up half of the population of the cities, and were also concentrated in shtetls that did not have city status; their main occupations were crafts (34.9%), trade (32.8%), services (11.7%), education and culture (9.7%). The Great Russian population performed the main connecting economic, cultural, and administrative functions.

DE Trust; governance; wellbeing; crisis; COVID 19
ID GOVERNMENT; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; HAPPINESS
AB The COVID-19 pandemic extended interest in the relationships between citizens and governments in turbulent times of crises and emergencies. While the pandemic generated a critical existential threat to the lives of many, it also had a significant effect on the quality of life and on the wellbeing of even larger populations. This paper deals with the relationship between the wellbeing of citizens and three types of trust in governance (i.e. trust in political institutions, trust in public administration, trust in enforcement institutions) during the pandemic. We aim at advancing knowledge on both wellbeing and trust during crises, and more specifically on direct and indirect patterns of these important relationships. To do so, we suggest alternative models and a series of hypotheses aimed at examining them empirically. Two datasets on Israeli citizens are used. They were collected over two points in time during the heat of the pandemic and toward its decline and end (Study 1/t1; N = 1026 and Study 2/t2; N = 3024) and largely represent major sectors and ethnicities in the population. The findings generally support a positive relationship between wellbeing and trust, but more importantly indicate that during crisis, trust in public administration and enforcement institutions mediates the relationship between wellbeing and trust in political institutions. We thus argue that the public service may act as a bridge between citizens' wellbeing and political trust. In our view, the findings testify to the complexity of the wellbeing-trust relationship, especially in challenging times. Implications and directions for future studies are suggested.Points for practitioners Trust in governance is different for various political institutions and for different public administration organizations, especially in turbulent times Civil servants should be aware of citizens' wellbeing during crises as it affects trust in governance Citizen trust and wellbeing are significantly related in times of emergency and crises

AB The author examines the collisions of the Soviet nation -building which are actively debated in modern historiography. The source base for the research is the published materials, as well as the archival documents of the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History and the Archive of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. There are analyzed some specific historical subjects and the contribution of modern historiography to the understanding of the current problems and the formulation of new ideas and approaches to the analysis of the designated set of issues including the tools of Soviet socio-political engineering, the role and significance of ethnopolitical elites in the creation of the USSR as a complex hierarchical structure. It is concluded that the contradictions in the implementation of ethnonational policy were directly related to the formation of the Soviet federation, which became a concession to the ethnopolitical movements of the early XX century; and managing diversity was the central task of the state as an alternative to previous political systems for culturally complex societies.

DE Iran; Iranian model; political system crisis; modernization;

AB The presidential election of 2021 set a new stage in shaping of the Iranian development model. The conservative discourse once again took its place as the main one for the whole country underpinning the return to the implementation of the conservative modernization project. Key components of this project are outlined in the comprehensive development plan "Vision 2025", as well as in the General Program for the Islamic-Iranian Progress. Among the development goals, which, according to this plan, Iran aims to achieve by 2025, are: sustainable economic growth; preservation and strengthening of the Islamic system and Islamic identity of Iran; regional leadership in economic, scientific, and technological development. Undoubtedly, to achieve these goals, a lot of work has been done by several governments, but it is obvious that these ambitions will not be fulfilled in the remaining period of the current government's term. In turn, the General Program for the Islamic-Iranian Progress shifts the focus from development (in its secular, Western definition) to progress, which can only be achieved in the framework of Islamic and Iranian values and principles. The Islamic model of modernization is proposed as a guideline for development in the spiritual, political, cultural, and scientific life. However, the most important problem in the implementation of this plan is the large number of long-term unresolved economic problems associated with the negative outcomes of sanctions and urgent political crises such as the legitimacy crisis, institutional crisis, as well as the general weakening of the prestige of the "Islamic component" of Iran's political system. The article analyzes the domestic development problems of Iran, which are relevant in the context of the ongoing crises, as well as the phenomenon of the "Iranian Model" with all of its political, economic, and social components.

DT Article
DE "School Strike for Climate"; "Fridays for Future"; Greta Thunberg;
   collective identity; political socialization; youth movements
AB This article is devoted to the study of the phenomenon of "Fridays for Future" (FFF) - a young movement of climate activists, whose leader since 2018 has been a Swedish (former) schoolgirl Greta Thunberg. The author's goal is to consider the contours of the future collective identity that is currently being formed among its participants. A special chapter of the article is devoted to the modern structure of the FFF community, which has transformed significantly, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The movement has successfully taken advantage of the Worldwide Network and diversified its activities. Therefore, even a partial loss of interest from the "big media" did not negatively affect its effectiveness. In another section, the results of the teenage activists' practices are evaluated. It is argued that at present, their achievements in terms of climate and political goals are not great yet compared to full-fledged "adult" organizations. However, such results are very significant for the community of underage citizens who do not yet have electoral rights, because it will definitely improve in the future. The author unequivocally shares the opinion of researchers who conclude about the "glocal" type of identity that develops in the FFF environment: its activists are focused on solving both global and local problems. It is also noted that young FFF participants use transformative tactics - this is a community of a purely reformist, absolutely not conservative kind. There was a split in their ranks into "moderate" and "radical" wings. This, on the one hand, generally testifies to their acceptance of traditional schemes for building political organizations. On the other hand, the young activists themselves are already enriching the current political mainstream with new influence.

DT Article
DE Walras; Tugan-Baranovsky; socialism; social ideal; economic science;
   problem of land
AB Nowadays, Leon Walras (1839-1910) is well-known first and foremost for his "Elements of pure political economy, or the theory of public wealth" (1874, 1877) and Mikhail Ivanovich Tugan-Baranovsky (1865-1919) gained a wide recognition due to his book "Industrial crises in contemporary England: Their causes and influences on the life of the people" (1894), which had a significant impact on the development of economics. At the same time, both economists were deeply concerned not only with theoretical problems, but also with those that are now considered beyond the scope of theory, the problem of social ideal and that of a more just social system being among them. Walras and Tugan-Baranovsky associated the embodiment of the social ideal with socialism and strived for an economic system that corresponded to that ideal, albeit their conceptions of socialism being different. The principal opportunity to achieve reconciliation between science and ideal was associated with a synthetic approach reconciling the scientific method and ideal, economics being considered "a bridge" between them, or a << testing ground >>, where the reconciliation was to take place. Although history has shown that Walras's and Tugan-Baranovsky's ideas of socialism were utopian, the very fact that two eminent economists were deeply concerned with the problem of social ideal and socialism at a time when the foundations of modern economics were being laid, shows that the striving of economists to create objective and rigorous science was, to a measure, driven by their aspiration to solve the social problem and to set up a social and economic system which is rational and more just than the existing one.

AB The authors analyze the process of interaction between Russia, Mexico and the United States in the context of the struggle for Alta California. The essence of this process was the diplomatic, military -political and economic activity of these powers aimed at occupying lands in California and legalizing them by some of them. The purpose of the study is to establish the reasons for the unsuccessful actions of Spain and Russia in Alta California which led to the subordination of this territory to the United States of America. The source base is the office, diplomatic and memoir sources published in various collections and periodicals. The study shows the struggle between Russia, Mexico and the United States for the possession of lands in Alta California. It was established that Russia acted through the Russian -American company which controlled the Russian colonies in America. At the same time, the Russian government adhered to the principle of legitimism which restrained the company's initiatives to expand its influence. The authors conclude that the United States was more active in the region and used its economic and trade superiority to increase its influence. Russia was unable to compete with the United States and missed a good opportunity to conclude an agreement with Mexico to confront the Americans and legalize its possessions in California, Fort Ross and other territories.

AB The article is analyzing the latest trends in China's participation in the integration processes in the Asia-Pacific region and their determining factors. The evolution of China's approaches to integration processes in the region in key areas of trade, economic and investment interaction is considered. China's integration cooperation with the Asia-Pacific countries is developing within three main multilateral formats, including the forum of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Comprehensive Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The One Belt, One Road Initiative occupies a special place in China's policy regarding integration processes in the Asia-Pacific region. The paper analyzes the directions of development of these formats, the nature of their interaction with each other, the prospects for the integration of the Asia-Pacific countries and China's participation in these processes. In connection with the stalled rounds of WTO trade negotiations and the postponement of the creation of a free trade area within the framework of the APEC, China's participation in the RCEP strengthens its regional position while China has now become the leading trading partner for the countries participating in the agreement. ASEAN countries' trade with China exceeds their trade with the United States. The article also considers trends and problems in the implementation of the Chinese One Belt, One Road Initiative. Among the problems are the discrepancies between the interests of the parties involved, the lack of investment resources, political factors. At the same time, the flexible nature of the Chinese Initiative, the absence of strict requirements for participants, and their interest in the project allows the One Belt, One Road to become the world's largest cooperation platform operating on the principles of an open mega-partnership.

AB Introduction. Student youth is the most active part of society. The development of the student personality is necessary to ensure a stable future society. The study is devoted to revealing the structure of ideas about volunteering among university students.
   Due to the difficult political and economic situation in the country and in the world as a whole, a multi-level volunteer movement is actively developing: from those supported by administrative structures to individual types of activities shown by individual citizens on their own initiative. The volunteer movement solves both local problems and goes to the national level, through the translation of the value base of its activity.
   Aim. The present research aims to study the structure of ideas about volunteering in university students and to identify the axiological content in these ideas. With this aim, complexes of semantic markers were identified, indicating groups of values according to the classification of S. Schwartz. This allows using semantic markers for axiological analysis of information.
   Methodology and research methods. As a method, an associative experiment modified for the research tasks, was used. 159 university students were interviewed in Ekaterinburg, Kurgan, and Tyumen. 1431 associations related to volunteering were analysed.
   Results. The weight of a value and its position in the hierarchy was determined by the number of associations that correlate with this value semantically. In the first place, there is the value of security, in terms of the security of another person. In the second place, there is the value of kindness, and, in the third place - the value of universalism. The value of universalism emphasises the voluntariness and disinterestedness of volunteering. This is followed by the value of independence, which expresses the aspect of activity and initiative. The next is the value of tradition. The values of stimulation, achievement, hedonism and conformity are the least expressed in students' perceptions. The values of security, universalism and kindness are fully reflected in the views of students. The values of independence and tradition are represented by a certain facet, aspect. Other values are represented weakly and diffusely. Such a differentiation of values is connected with the content of volunteering, as well as with the students' ideas about it. The study shows the fundamental isomorphism of the content of activity, ideas about this activity and the relevance of the hierarchy of personal values.
   Scientific novelty. The ideas about volunteering are considered through the prism of personal values. A hierarchically organised profile of values associated with volunteering is revealed.
   Practical significance. Many organisations are in need of volunteer help but are having difficulties recruiting and retaining volunteers. The value of the current research is to understand what can attract and retain volunteers.

AB Afghan-Pakistan relations in XXI century have been plagued with issues, and the rise of the Taliban has compounded the difficulties. The traditional problems, including the disputed Durand Line between the two nations, persist. The current inflexible policies of the Taliban and the ongoing political crisis in Pakistan have hampered compromise. The article proposes that resolving the border status issue requires involvement from both global and regional powers. It suggests that intensively monitoring efforts, reinforcing interstate dialogue, joint anti-terrorism measures, and mutually beneficial economic projects are possible ways to deescalate tensions along the contentious border. Despite both sides' attempts to manage the border, it remains a primary area of tension between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pakistan has been criticized for not making adequate efforts to eliminate terror groups operating in the border regions. Conversely, extremist groups, including ISIS, have actively targeted Afghanistan, seeking to expand their influence in the region. Coordinated action could eliminate such groups. The lack of political will is the biggest obstacle to progress in solving the mutual problems. As a result, the article suggests the need for international organizations' involvement, such as China offering financial and technical assistance in resolving border disputes and terrorism. The UN can offer a neutral platform and enhance monitoring efforts concerning threats such as ISIS. In summary, the article underscores that despite the Taliban's resurgence, the age-old issues between Afghan-Pakistani nations continue to undermine long-standing relations. The disputed Durand Line and inflexible policies hinder cooperation, but it is possible to resolve the territorial border dispute with the involvement of international actors.

ID MORAL JUDGMENT
AB Belief systems are core organizing factors of social attitudes and behaviors, and their study has highlighted the role of conservatism as a contributing mechanism in mitigating concerns associated with change avoidance, as well as the reduction of uncertainty and ambiguity in life. Moreover, these aspects seem to be consistently used as powerful tools in the political and social discourse of the far-right. Life and death ethics are an example of issues that deal with the need for stability and control over personal and social life that people endorsing conservative values seek to attain. There is a rich line of studies on the individual and social explanatory factors of political conservatism, but less attention has been dedicated to moral conservatism as an autonomous and meaningful concept. The current research follows a multilevel approach to disentangle the individual and contextual correlates of conservative attitudes toward life and death. Thus, besides looking at the influence of individual choices related to religion and political orientation, this study also seeks to analyse the impact of the context, introducing in the model variables measuring economic performance, social and gender inequality, religious diversity and the prevalence of materialism and post-materialism values. Multilevel models using data from the 34 countries that participated in the last wave of the European Values Study (2017-2020), revealed an association between far-right orientation and conservative attitudes toward life and death, and that this relationship is moderated by materialism/post-materialism values, economic performance, and social inequality. Our findings reinforce the role of democracy as an environment where freedom of choice and thought are indisputable rights, cherished by most of the populations, regardless of their political position or their stance on moral issues.

AB The article is focal research dedicated to reconstruction of the image of St. Petersburg - Petrograd - Leningrad universities in documentary photography. The study is based on photographic documents stored in Central State Archive of Photo, Phonographic and Cinema Documents of St. Petersburg, which is dated 1905 - the late 1930s. Author gives notes the specific of archival collection and gives and groups documents by topics, showing that the most popular plots were about students and faculty members as well as the participation of universities in political events. Results of the research allow complementing the socio-cultural portrait of professors and students and to trace how changed the image of higher education in public discourse during the period under review. Visual sources contain incomplete statements. Documentary photography reflects milestones of transformation Imperial universities into the Soviet one, its role in public and political life. The pre-revolutionary university was one of the Russian Empire political centers. Students often initiated strikes with political demands. Lots of professors were members of the Cadet party. Photographing was conducted to order, so at that time portrait and group photographs depicting members of academic community prevailed. After revolution in February 1917, firstly Provisional Government, then Bolsheviks positioned universities as public educational institutes that was reflected in documentary photographs. In photos of Soviet time there was a trend towards democratization of students' and university members' image, that was also due to opening new type of universities for trained personnel in the shortest possible time. It was primarily done for agitation and implementation of initiatives of Soviet government. Higher education was tasked with bringing up a new generation of socialist intelligentsia, so universities were presented as institutions loyal to Bolsheviks, like institutions rebuilt their work in accordance to the communist ideology for sake of building future of the country.

AB In the context of studying mass political repressions in the USSR, an attempt was made to look at the role of terror in order to radically transform a marginal and transitional society into a socialist society. The processes of politicization of common crimes and social anomalies, and the intensification of extrajudicial repressions in the 1930s against criminal and deviant segments of the population are shown. For the first time, the materials of extrajudicial "Kulak" and "Militia" troikas in the Kazakh SSR and the processed data of protocol statistics are introduced into scientific circulation. The evolution and specifics of extrajudicial bodies are demonstrated, an in-depth analysis of the contingent of the repressed is carried out. The purpose of the article is to study the scale of social purge among criminal, marginal and deviant groups of the population in the Kazakh SSR during the implementation of the two large-scale repressive campaigns of the Great Terror period, namely, the "Kulak" and "Militia" operations of the NKVD of the USSR. It has been established that during the period of the most massive repressive campaign of the Great Terror, known as the "Kulak" operation, almost 27 thousand people were repressed in Kazakhstan, including almost 3.7 thousand people as "criminals", and a third of them were shot. In total, during 1937-1938 in the Kazakh SSR, more than 15 thousand people were repressed by extrajudicial bodies as criminal and declassed elements. It is concluded that the politicization of the status of marginals made it possible to exaggerate their social danger, which led to mass repressions against them.

AB The development of digital platforms significantly changes the potential and practices of citizen participation in management and decision-making. The routinization of usage of the Internet by the youth allows for the inclusion of a wide range of digital practices in the political sphere in their private everyday lives. Despite the obvious and recognized advantages of online communication, their presence and digital infrastructure do not in themselves determine the intensity of young people's appeal to dialogue with the authorities and the effectiveness of this interaction. In order to identify the characteristics, motives and obstacles in the system of digital interaction between young people and authorities, we conducted a sociological study of Yekaterinburg residents aged 17-35years. The sample consisted of 1,350 people. Based on the results of the study, the main forms of digital appeals of young people to power structures were identified. Four types of young citizens were revealed basing on the scope of use of digital channels: maximalist users, generalists, minimalists, and non-users of online communication tools with the authorities. Next, five groups of factors were identified that act as barriers to the choice and readiness to use digital forms of interaction with authorities: insufficient digital competencies, distrust and low assessment of digital forms of interaction, limited online communication capabilities and discomfort in the perception of government accounts. It was found that the majority of young respondents have ideas, judgments or problems in digital communication related to two or more barriers. We assess this as a high level of barrier to digital interaction with authorities. An important aspect of overcoming barriers is the formation of motivation for youth social activity, and the study identified the structure of youth motives. The leading importance of motives for effective influence on the situation and power, the high importance of motives for solving personal problems, and the less pronounced influence of motives of social solidarity and civic duty have been determined. Prospects for further research are seen in the study of digital interaction on the part of government structures.

AB The article provides a comparative study of the place and role of "ethnic parties" in the modern world, in which ethnicity is extremely politicized, which often contributes to the emergence of interethnic conflicts and destabilization of the political systems of multiethnic states. The author analyzed six really practical ways of including ethnic parties in the political process: (1) ethnic parties representing minorities living compactly in a region advocate changing the status quo - an institutional transformation of center-regions interactions associated with an increase in the status and subjectivity of such a region/minority; (2) a regional ethnic minority, through an ethnic party, fights for the preservation of the status quo if there is a threat to the already existing status of the group or it has been lost for some reason; (3) the use of ethnic parties as a factor of influence from the outside, which is fraught with increased tension in the relations of two or more neighboring states; (4) situations when activities of ethnic parties contribute to the split, degradation and even destruction of political systems; (5) a situation when an ethnic/regional party seeks greater territorial autonomy or even the (re-)creation of "its own national state"; (6) activities of ethnic parties in the conditions of so-called "ethnic democracies". Further, the institutional conditions for ensuring the political representation of ethnic minorities, while maintaining the stability of the political system, are investigated. As a result, the author comes to the conclusion: despite the fact that the ethnization of the political process potentially divides and even opposes people of different ethnicities and thereby can strengthen the split in society, the inclusion of ethnic parties in the developing of a national political course allows reducing interethnic tensions, and ethnic minority groups receive a channel for broadcasting their own needs and attitudes both to the state power and to non-ethnic citizens of the country. Therefore, the ban on the creation of ethnic and regional parties cannot be considered as a universal anti-crisis remedy and even more so as a panacea for all political ills.

AB Marshall McLuhan's media theory and philosophy of history are considered as a political phenomenon of the 1950-1970s. His contribution to the development of political technologies, analysis of the influence of the media on democratic institutions, popularization of the Western supremacy in figurative, metaphorical, and cultural studies' forms allow classifying the Canadian sociologist as a notable ideologist of the Cold War, along with propagandists of mass consumer society, mass culture and convergence. Choosing the communication criteria as the defining to the past and modern status of states, McLuhan rejected the dogmas of Marxism and considered the USSR to be a lagging country, despite the recognition of Soviet achievements in science and technology (Sputnik, space). He foresaw a "beyond-systems", planetary future of the "global village" in the "era of electronics", escape from bipolarity, a diverse and conflictual and at the same time general "electric" coexistence of countries beyond boundaries. McLuhan's research of the negative effects of the media on mass consciousness and people's behavior is less acknowledged than his predictions of the worldwide computer network. He supposed that the influence of the media on politics might increase to the extent when reality could be replaced by computer-generated and suggested responsible and preventive state regulation of the informational field.

AB The concept of the Right to the City, introduced into scientific use by Henri Lefebvre in the late 1960s, is actively used in the study of conflicts between residents and city authorities, as well as between different groups of citizens. However, such studies tend to overlook a special type of city - capitals, where the social demands of local residents oppose the political expectations of the country's population. In this case the debate around the interpretation of space comes to the fore, and here the conflict is transferred from the field of social and political activism to the field of symbols. This problem is especially acute in countries with ambiguous identities, where the capital is aimed to represent geographically and culturally diverse territories. Moscow is one of such capitals. This article, using the example of Moscow Zaryadye Park, examines the conflict of capital city space interpretation and possible ways of resolving it. Drawing on such sources as the projects, created by the participants of the contest to create the architectural concept of the park, analytical materials of "Zaryadye" digest, issued by Moscow Architecture and Urban Planning Committee, as well as Yandex.Wordstat web service statistics, the author shows, that the symbols of the capital and the local can coexist in one landscape. The article demonstrates that Zaryadye Park contains images of the capital that represent national identity. These images are embodied in specific design solutions that provide a balance between the interests of citizens, who perceive this space mainly physically, and the perception of the country's population, for whom visual images play an important role. According to the author's conclusion, it is precisely thanks to such objects as Zaryadye Park that it is possible to resolve the conflict around the interpretation of capital city space, which for the population of the country turns out to be political (the space of images), and for citizens - social (the space of functions).

AB In this paper, the authors propose novel methodology to analyze the dynamics of large-scale online network structures caused by significant exogenous shocks (foreign policy crises and the onset of military conflicts). The article focuses on diagnosing cohesion or polarization processes. As a first step, on the basis of the existing theoretical traditions, the authors analyze mechanisms at the micro-level that may lead to consolidation or polarization. Among these, they reveal mechanisms based on changes in position and mechanisms based on changes in identity. As a second step, the authors determine the "network projection" of these mechanisms' actions: the changes in the structures of interaction networks between individuals they lead to. At this point mathematical modeling plays a key role, allowing for specific predictions regarding network behavior, expressed in changes in observable metrics. Four network indicators are proposed: the number of communities (clusters), modularity, the number of connections, and the average degree of nodes. As a result of computational experiments, the expected dynamics of all the indicators is calculated, which is compared with the corresponding mechanisms of changes in political positions or identity. As a third step, these predictions are compared with the indicators calculated from the empirical data. For the empirical analysis the article uses messages from the Russian- language political and news telegram channels, corresponding in time to the start of a special military operation (February-March, 2022), and those that chronologically occur 10 months earlier or later (April, 2021, and December, 2022). The general sample of such messages contains those with hyperlinks to other channels. It is the presence of such hyperlinks is considered to be a sign of the connection and is used to build a network. For each time period, the same network parameters are measured as for the computational data. Comparison of the observed dynamics with what is predicted by the models indicates that in the case of the special military operation, one key mechanism was at work - cohesion through the expansion of in-group boundaries, based on shifting to higher-order identity categories.

DE art; technoscience; Art & Science; STS; transcendental ontology;
   empirical metaphysics; applied philosophy
ID HISTORY-OF-SCIENCE
AB In the article the assumptions, strategies and possibilities of Art & Science (A&S) are considered through the prism of three types of metaphysical thinking. These types are defined by the answers to the question: why is there something rather than nothing. Thus, the analysis of classical metaphysics makes it possible to identify the basic assumptions of many A&S projects. These assumptions are borrowed by art from the public self -presentation of science and from Western common sense: there is an autonomous and definite nature, it is successfully known and mastered by science. So nature is nature, and nothing more. These assumptions are disputed by post-Kantian transcendental ontology. It opens up for A&S the opportunity to reflect upon the givenness of nature in the experience mediated by science, namely the constitution of science's own objectivity, the social and political factors involved, as well as naturalization processes that turn scientific objects into nature things by way of erasing their origin. Nature is in the eye of the beholder. Empirical metaphysics (a number of projects from STS) sheds light on laboratory practices of nature enactment and the role of non -human actors in these processes. Nature is not only in the eye of the beholder, but also in the hands of the doer. It is assembled gathers, among other things, from the tissues of society, politics, culture, so does not oppose them from the outside. Among other things, this move allows us to define Art & Science as the enactment or performance of technoscience, since the laboratory -technical aesthetics inherent in this art is a reenactment of the part of the technoscientific network of practices and actors. In conclusion, by means of Pierre Bourdieu's critical sociology, a hypothesis is formulated explaining why an alliance with STS may be problematic for A&S artists, and why posthumanism and new materialism are assimilated in this art in a cliched form. The technoscientifically formed world requires technoscientific enlightenment based on STS and philosophy, and A&S in alliance with them can be its art.

DE iconography; St. George; St. Dimitrius; medieval fresco painting;

AB Veneration of St. George and St. Demetrius was widely popular both in Byzantium and among the southern Slavs. As a rule, in numerous scientific studies dedicated to monuments associated with these saints, the main attention is paid to iconographic and stylistic features, while this paper considers the issue of influence on the spread of their cult, first of all, of the key aspects of the ideology of the Serbian rulers Nemanji & cacute;i, examining the monuments of the Serbian medieval art located in Macedonia. Closer attention to individual iconographic subjects, from our point of view, can shed light on the complex and very diverse picture of the development of Serbian painting in the 14(th) century and identify both its specifics and common points of contact with the Byzantine art. From this point of view, the appeal to the images of holy warriors can serve as one example of interaction between the Byzantine themes and local specifics, due to the general idea of preserving national self-identity within the framework of the general << byzantinization >>. It is no less interesting to trace and identify the reasons for the emphasis on national ideas and individual local characteristics during the reign of King Milutin, when the state ideology gradually became imperial, and their gradual smoothing out from about the 1340s, due to the specific political ambitions of King Stefan Du & scaron;an, who sought not as much towards integration into the Byzantine paradigm as practically towards its appropriation. In this historical and political context, it is interesting to trace how these events are reflected in the further spread of the cults of Sts. George and Demetrius, since, on the one hand, St. George is one of the most revered Byzantine saints, on the other hand, his veneration is closely connected with Stefan Nemanja (the founder of the Nemanji & cacute; dynasty and one of the main national Serbian saints). Iconography of St. Demetrius of Thessalonica had a close relationship with the main center of veneration of this saint - Thessalonica, where many iconographic variants arose, as well as with the surrounding Greek and Slavic lands. In addition, this saint was closely associated with the Palaiologan dynasty, and the city, whose patron he was, became important during the reign of King Milutin, for the Serbian rulers also.

AB This paper distinguishes the cosmological priority of beauty between Plotinus and al-Farabi on the one hand and Schopenhauer and Nishida on the other. The study shows that the former elevated Beauty to the highest degree possible within the threshold of discursive language and thinking, whereas beauty held the penultimate cosmological rank for the latter. Therefore, the paper illustrates the historical transformation of beauty throughout one and a half millennia by studying the philosophy of four significant thinkers. In Schopenhauer, beauty serves as an escape mechanism that guides the human being to turn away from the root cause of all suffering, namely, the will. Schopenhauer's viewpoint here led to his prioritisation of aestheticism over the sciences, for conceptual thought proves incapable of reaching pure cognition. Nishida appropriates Schopenhauer's view to a large degree, although the will is not the root of all suffering for the former, but an impulsive force that one must assimilate with to reach the same end: pure experience. Nishida and Schopenhauer differ from Plotinus and al-Farabi in refusing any discourse about an absolute First Principle and its relatability to beauty. For Plotinus and al-Farabi, in contrast, Beauty is the emanating power of the One or First Principle. Based on this emanating power, Plotinus and al-Farabi determined the cosmos to perpetually project Beauty and simultaneously draw all beings back towards it. It is Beauty that serves as the drawing power of the One or First Principle; all beings by nature desire Beauty and attain varying degrees of it. I conclude by showing that for Plotinus and al-Farabi, one seeks Beauty as an end in itself, and in so doing, the perfecting of one's soul ensues as the natural function of the cosmos.

DT Article
DE Rorty; Kant; epistemology; neopragmatism; hermeneutics
AB The article considers the criticism of negation of epistemology as an autonomous philosophical discipline by the neopragmatist Richard Rorty. The main flaw of epistemology, according to Rorty, is that the science of cognition itself presupposes the dualism of the inner and the outer, the objective world and the human world denied by pragmatism. Among the ways to eliminate epistemology from philosophical discourse, Rorty suggests two types of argumentation: firstly, he declares it a relatively recent "invention" of the 17th century, and, secondly, this invention is due to Kant's erroneous, from his point of view, setting philosophy on the "safe path of science". The article examines the reconstruction of Rorty's argument by a prominent representative of traditional philosophy, Michael Williams, and Rorty's reaction to it. It is shown that, in his efforts to refute the discrediting of epistemology, Williams did not take into account Rorty's radicalism. The article demonstrates that such radicalism seeks to eliminate the disciplinary framework in philosophy in order to avoid highlighting epistemology in it. In addition, Rorty rejects the history of philosophy as a series of attempts to deal with a well-known set of problems - ethical, epistemological and metaphysical. Another strategy of Rorty is to closely associate the term "epistemology" with the concept of representation as a copy, or mirror, of something external. Rorty's efforts to compromise these ideas in his concept of representation as a "Mirror of Nature" are coupled with his thesis that any philosophical conversation should not appeal to something that goes beyond the problems associated with man, to something external to man. Epistemology in this regard is a violation of this maxim. The article shows that, in his criticism of epistemology, Rorty advocates replacing epistemological cognitive explanations with a vague metaphor of the "conversation of mankind". Rejecting the strict scientific way of agumentation in philosophy, Rorty places the responsibility for the emergence of epistemology on Kant, who put philosophy on the "safe path of science". It is noted that it is the neglect of the scientific vision of the world by the pragmatist Rorty that is closely linked to his criticism of epistemology. As a result, Rorty resorts to a "different" philosophy, in which the virtues of objective cognition give way to linguistic hermeneutical procedures

ID MIGRATION; WAR
AB The article is devoted to the formation and development of the image of the Chinese Red Army soldier on the fronts of the Civil War in Russia. The author's attention is focused on the following key subjects: the creation of the image, its gradual "silence" in the 1930s against the background of internal political transformations and the aggravation of the military-political situation on the eastern borders, active use in the context of rapprochement between the USSR and China in the 1950s, rethinking in modern Russia. The main methodological approach is historical imagology. This scientific approach allows us to see how the mechanisms of social inclusion and exclusion worked in the example of the Chinese. The source base consisted of materials from Soviet periodicals, propaganda posters of the white movement, works of fiction about the Civil War and modern Russian films. The author's key argument is that the dynamics of representation of the image of a Chinese Red Army soldier reflects the ambivalent attitude of Russian society not only towards Chinese migrants, but also towards migration problems. Rethinking the images of the "Chinese Red Army international detachments" at a turning point in Russian history depends on the state of Russian-Chinese relations and the stages of the presence of the Chinese in Russia.

AB This article examines the activities of the combines of the Leningrad branch of the USSR Art Fund in the mid-to late-1950s. During this period, the Leningrad branch of the USSR Art Fund comprised two combines with responsibilities related to the art industry: the Painting and Sculpture Combine and the Art and Design Combine. The materials preserved in the Central State Archive of Literature and Art of St Petersburg facilitate an understanding of the primary avenues through which the Art Fund influenced the formation of the living environment of Soviet citizens during the period under review. The shift from the period of late Stalinism to the Thaw era was accompanied by substantial alterations in the visual representation and structural configuration of this environment. The analysis of the activities of the combines permits a more precise understanding of the way these images were embodied, implemented, and disseminated at the level of specific production practices. The difficulties faced by the combines were a significant factor in adjusting the ideological framework in which their activities were to be based. The most important problem was the problem of unsatisfactory material and technical base, lack of modern equipment and trained personnel. Despite the government's stated commitment to the role of decorative, applied, and industrial arts in shaping the living environment of Soviet citizens, the implementation of this policy was hindered by a lack of adequate funding. In many ways, the range of products was formed spontaneously. The artists themselves played a significant role in shaping it. Changes in the subjects and images of the products produced by the combines during the period of the early Thaw make it possible to trace exactly how the formation of the so-called Leningrad style took place. A significant factor here was the postponed celebration of the 250(th) anniversary of Leningrad, which also became one of the markers of the onset of a new political era. It seems that all the above-mentioned circumstances associated with the actual practices of producing elements of the living environment of a Soviet person should be considered when analysing the general plan of chamber propaganda of the era.

DE R. Owen; K. Marx; socialism; cooperation
AB The article is devoted to the process of formation of social cooperation in Great Britain in the XIX century and how this process was reflected in the works of R. Owen and K. Marx. The peculiarity of the English cooperators was the understanding of the transformation process purely economic, not political, and the symbol was Workers' bazaars and consumer partnerships. A distinctive feature of Owen's organizations and the organizations of his followers is also that the concept of "cooperation" is replaced by "socialism", which is reflected in their work. Marx, on the other hand, focuses precisely on the first term. Marx determines the development of cooperation by natural socio-economic factors. The peculiarity of Marx and Engels' approach to the problem of cooperation lies in the fact that they consider cooperative enterprises not only as economic associations of workers, but primarily as social institutions reflecting the features of a new historical form of cooperation.

DT Article
DE cancel culture; ostracism; ethics; identity; identification; symbolic;
   space; symbolic politics; community; exclusion
AB This article examines the phenomenon of "cancel culture" through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu's theory of symbolic space. This approach allows us to go beyond traditional ethical and political frameworks, connecting cancel culture to the processes of building collective identity through social exclusion and ostracism. In order to establish its boundaries, a community needs to define specific symbolic capital, which is reflected in both unifying symbols and the ways it distinguishes itself from others. This opposition is primarily expressed through negative symbols that help create a distinct identity. Cancel culture functions as a tool in the struggle for symbolic capital, leading to a restructuring of roles within the social landscape. This results in the emergence of four distinct groups: the "canceled," the "cancelers-initiators," the "cancelers-executors," and the "authorities." The interactions among these groups foster the development of new identities. It is concluded that in today's public space, where virtualization accelerates the creation and dissemination of identifying symbols, various forms of identity are being formed. The process of canceling initiates a dual dynamic: it not only defines the identity of the canceling community but also encourages the communities of those canceled to fight for a positive redefinition of their own symbolic capital.

DT Article
DE cancel culture; politics of regret; historical identity; community;
   oblivion
AB The article analyzes cancel culture as a form of historical oblivion. Existing classifications of historical oblivion formulate criteria in different ways to distinguish different types of oblivion. Paul Connerton's classification is based on a variety of functions of historical oblivion - from the repressive action of the state to the natural obsolescence of material or intangible elements of tradition. Aleida Assmann's classification is based on the difference in the positions of the offender and the victim, which allows us to formulate four possible options for historical oblivion: dialogical oblivion, oblivion on the part of victims, oblivion on the part of criminals, and dialogical memory. All of these forms involve articulating one's own position and waiting for a reaction from another community. The formation of cancel culture in modern society leads to the emergence of a new form of historical oblivion, in which the exclusion of memories from public space is considered as compensation for the inconsistency of certain memorials with the modern structure of social and symbolic space. The main factor in the emergence of this phenomenon is the transformation of collective identities, which generates a traumatic perception of the past and the need to develop new rules for the interaction of communities. Cancel culture relies on moral justification for forgetting and involves the use of media communications to publicly represent the position of one community in relation to others, allowing it to be seen as a specific form of social ostracism. The phenomenon of cancel culture can be analyzed in several theoretical aspects. In a moral and ethical sense, the key issue is the use of categories of ethics to assess the activities of individual or collective entities committed in a fundamentally different historical situation. In the legal sense, of particular interest is the need to determine the boundaries of the operation of those compensation mechanisms that imply not only symbolic, but also economic or legal sanctions in relation to the community subject to cancellation. In a socio-philosophical sense, it is worth considering cancel culture in the context of the categories of solidarity and identity, paying special attention to those symbolic splits to which the imperative requirement of oblivion leads.

   Contest"
AB The discussion of the international contest "Eurovision Song Contest" takes place from the standpoint of interdisciplinary research and using the "optics" of various fields of knowledge (culturology, political science, ethnography, ethics and law, marketing, and others). The interest of different specialists is due to the diversity of its goals, strategies and capabilities. The analysis of the artistic and musical-stylistic side of the competitive production is quite rare due to the fact that "Eurovision Song Contest" belongs to the phenomenon of mass musical culture, which always requires the combination of traditional musicology tools with other approaches.
   Russia joined Eurovision in 1994. To date, disputes about the need / uselessness of participation in the competition have not subsided and the issue of increasing the level of loyalty to Russia on an international scale is being resolved. This article attempts to look at the competition products exhibited by Russia not so much from the standpoint of foreign policy relations, but from the standpoint of the Russian internal cultural structure and the transmission of our cultural values and narratives. The presentation of Russia, its songs participating in the "Eurovision Song Contest" as a tool for positioning the country in the international arena, cultural branding, as well as discovering our self-identity is comprehended through the application of the concept of Archeomodern of the Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin. Characterized by the dominance of the irrational and the invasion of alien elements, the conflict of opposites and the proximity of heterogeneous properties, uncertainty and the lack of a balanced plan, archeomodern manifests itself in many layers of our culture.
   An analysis of the repertoire policy, the choice of artists carried out by domestic producers, musical style of songs allows us to state the inconsistent nature of the throwing between the values of absolutely opposite civilizational methods, the familiarization and, at the same time, the overcoming of modern; solidarity and sabotage of Western European destiny; struggles of values imposed from outside, artistic techniques with root, traditional-archaic elements of national culture. Following the traditions of the Soviet stage and "connecting" to foreign standards in the songs of M. Katz, A. Pugacheva, F. Kirkorov (1990s), danceable Euro-pop in a monotonous series of English-language songs (2000-2010s with breakbeats-"breakthroughs" on the thieves' slogan in the composition "Do not believe, do not be afraid, don't ask" by the "Tatu" in 2003, or the diffusion of folk, dance and rock layers in "Party for Everybody" by the "Buranovskiye Babushki" in 2012), a symbiosis of Slavic and Eastern modality in the bilingual hip-hop composition "Russian Woman" by the singer Manizha (2021) are a reflection of the landfill space as a paradigm space of the Archeomodern.

AB The article substantiates that logically incorrect "Borgesian classifications", which include sets of objects distinguished for different reasons, still exhibit pragmatic relevance. These pragmatic bases of classifications may not correspond to the basic function of science: the implementation of fundamental scientific research, and may not correspond to culturally and socially determined expectations and communicative requests for science. But this does not negate the fact that science (in order to protect its communicative autonomy) within the framework of applied research is forced to respond to communicative requests from the outside. The article criticizes the approach of A.V. Sakharova. In particular, it is substantiated that despite the fact that the author distances himself from the Borgesian classification, nevertheless, by asserting the pragmatic necessity of some taxonomies, she implicitly builds and uses it. We will also show that these pragmatic grounds for defining taxa do not serve the basic function of basic science. This unique function consists of conducting fundamental research, which precisely distances itself from socially determined, external (political, value-religious, economic) requirements for science: greater usefulness, relevance, social significance, the creation of ideologies, etc. However, in some circumstances (primarily in order to assert its own autonomy) and as if ignoring its own research interest, science is forced in one way or another to respond to external socio-communicative demands from adjacent communication systems. It is in these pragmatically defined contexts that Borgesian-type classifications can be used.

AB This article is devoted to the analysis of key aspects of current changes in the system of military and political planning of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Within the framework of the post-bipolar world order, a complex process of transformation of the strategic priorities of activities and organizational structure of the alliance is underway. Its key meaning is the effective adaptation of NATO to the significant changes that have occurred in international politics since the adoption of the last strategic concept in 2010. At the same time, the further expansion and internal strengthening of the military-political bloc is designed to ensure the formation of an international order consistent with the long-term interests of the United States and its western allies. The dynamics of international processes and growing contradictions of the key trends of global development have necessitated the optimization of the activities of the alliance and the adaptation of its functional mechanism to changing international conditions. This task received its doctrinal formalization within the framework of the new strategic concept of the alliance, adopted at the Madrid summit on 29 June 2022. Scientific analysis of the forms and mechanisms of NATO's adaptation to new operating conditions involves empirical consideration and comparative analysis of the key areas of the activities of the alliance. Within the framework of the undertaken research, based on the application of systemic and structural approaches, as well as the integrated use of general scientific and special methods of political science research, this article analyzes the content of the new doctrinal document both from the point of view of continuity of long-term strategic orientations of NATO's activities and from the position of identifying new components in its military-political planning system. Special attention is paid to the changes related to the conceptually defined priorities of the strategy of the alliance in the sphere of confrontation between the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China (PRC). The analysis of the contradictory processes taking place in NATO and reflected in the content of the NATO 2030 Agenda and the 2022 Strategic Concept seems to be fundamentally significant both in the context of understanding the logic of the development of the entire structure of European and international security and from the point of view of assessing the prospects for further development of relations between the largest military-political bloc and the Russian Federation and other leading actors.

   neocolonialism; Marxism; multipolarity
AB In 2022, the European Union (EU) took the unprecedented step of providing financial assistance for military purposes to a warring state, Ukraine, while also establishing mechanisms to incentivize member states to supply arms and military equipment to Kyiv. The article traces the development of Marti's ideas as they were adopted and expanded upon by diverse political movements, including radical patriots, socialists, and communists. Particular attention is given to the interpretation of anti-imperialist thought by Julio Antonio Mella, the founder of the Communist Party of Cuba and the Cuban section of the Anti-Imperialist League of the Americas. After the Cuban Revolution's victory in 1959, a new structural component emerged under Marxist-Leninist influence: the principle of proletarian internationalism. This principle was institutionalized in Cuban anti-imperialist ideology and codified in official documents, including foreign policy declarations and the 1976 Constitution. Following the collapse of the "world system of socialism" and the USSR, during the "Special Period in Peacetime," Cuba was compelled to reevaluate its economic foundations and foreign policy. This period saw the removal of proletarian internationalism from the Cuban Constitution and the termination of military assistance to national liberation and revolutionary movements. Cuban internationalism shifted its focus to humanitarian missions, marking a significant ideological transformation. The VI Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba (2011) reinforced these changes, with humanitarian missions increasingly commercialized where feasible, and foreign policy emphasizing the defense of international law, advocacy for multipolarity, and the pursuit of an alternative, fairer world order. In contemporary Cuban anti-imperialism, the Marxist-Leninist components-such as class analysis and proletarian internationalism-play a reduced role, reflecting the leadership's adaptability to changes in the international system. This analysis highlights the evolution and resilience of Cuban anti-imperialist ideology as it adjusts to shifting geopolitical realities while maintaining its foundational principles.

ID NUCLEAR-WEAPONS
AB Without delving into medieval history, we can expect that after World War I, disarmament issues became an important object of world politics, and after World War II, they took a central place in it. The monstrous destructive power, speed and constant readiness of nuclear weapons, capable of destroying entire states in a few hours, have fundamentally transformed the dialectics of politics and war. Clausewitz's sacramental formula: "War is & scy;ontinuation of the policy by other, violent means" - has now become a street with a 'two-way movement.' These violent means are tangible, influence politics, and sometimes dictate the rules for its behavior. Hence the logic of disarmament: influencing the means of war through agreements on their limitation and elimination to reduce the likelihood of war, to reduce its destructive effects and the economic costs of an arms race. However, practice has shown that these elements of the classical 'triad' of disarmament do not always harmoniously complement each other, and often come in conflict with each other. Fundamental disarmament issues remain unresolved to this day or are being re-initiated as the world order changes and science and technology develop. Worse, at the moment, the collapse of the disarmament treaty system built over decades is leading to a new arms race, while there is a possibility of transferring control over their use to supercomputers. At the same time, the half-century history of disarmament negotiations has shown that, with the creation of favorable political conditions, compromises are achievable on the most complex strategic and technical issues - with the goodwill of government leaders, the support of political elites and the persistent efforts of military and civilian professionals.

AB This article examines the views that emerged among the Russian officer corps during the 1870s and 1880s regarding the German and Austro-Hungarian armies. The aim of the study is to illuminate the process of shaping these perceptions, trace their historical dynamics, and identify the factors influencing the transformation of Russian officers' views during this period. Investigating this topic contributes to a deeper understanding of Russian foreign and military policy in the 1870s and 1880s, a time when a specific balance of power was taking shape in Europe and the outlines of military-political alliances that defined the nature of bloc opposition during World War I began to emerge. The study focuses primarily on the perspectives of the General Staff officer corps, as their responsibilities included the systematic study of foreign armies and the application of this knowledge for Russian military needs. Based on the conducted research, it is concluded that between the 1870s and 1880s, the attitude of the Russian officer corps towards the German army underwent changes that aligned with a sequence of "adversary" - "competitor" - "enemy," while the Austro-Hungarian army was perceived as Russia's key "competitor" in the Balkans.

DE terminology; cognitive sciences; cognitive turn; sociocognitive theory
   of terminology; frame theory of terminology; network structure of
   terminology
AB Terminology is studied as a cognitive phenomenon in order to clarify what is changing in the understanding of the term, terminology, and terminological activity in connection with the cognitive turn occurring in recent decades in the field of epistemology and cognitive sciences. The authors draw attention to the fact that the transformation of ideas about knowledge (scientific knowledge), the nature of its implementation in the context of a change in epistemological paradigms is accompanied by changes in such key components of the cognitive process as subject, object, language. If in the epistemological paradigm of positivism a certain cognitive certainty was associated with these concepts (the subject is the central cognitive actor, the object is empirically knowable, language is directly related to the subject in its description of the object, etc.), then when moving away from the epistemological paradigm of positivism ideas about the subject, object and language lose their definition. The subject loses the evidence of rationality and cannot rely on the evidence of his own reflection, which means the loss of his autonomy and self-sufficiency. The object appears as a complex multi-level formation where each level can be described on the basis of scientific theories alone, but there are no theories that describe all levels of the world as an object of knowledge and there are no theories that would correlate their descriptions of the world with each other. Language also appears as a certain way of describing the world whose nature is playful in nature and depends on the social conditions of its use. If in the epistemological paradigm of positivism terminology appears as the culmination of a cognitive process, completing it in the form of a dictionary or reference book, then in the modern epistemological paradigm terminology appears as a decentralized functionality, the essence of which cannot be reduced to the formation of a dictionary or reference book of a professional field of knowledge or scientific discipline. Today, terminological work is rather a process of a cognitive nature with corresponding semantic, linguistic, cognitive, sociocultural and other components, within which it is virtually impossible to indicate its beginning and end. A terminological corpus is a network structure consisting of various ontologies (databases, knowledge bases, etc.) connected to each other, but this connectedness is implicit. Carrying out terminological work is the processing of databases using terminology to establish as many connections as possible between them. In other words, terminological work is associated with the construction of ontologies by inscribing the latter into social reality. The influence of the cognitive turn on terminological activity is manifested in the formation of cognitive theories of terminology, such as the sociocognitive theory of terminology by Rita Temmerman and the frame theory of terminology by Pamela Faber. These theories demonstrate in different ways the consideration of terminology as a cognitive phenomenon, but in general they reflect the changes that occur in connection with the change in the status of the latter.

DE terminology; disciplinary status; subject area; theories of
   terminological planning; socio-philosophical foundations;
   sociolinguistic approach
AB The disciplinary status and subject field of terminology are examined in order to clarify what terminological work includes and what factors have the greatest influence on it. Despite the apparent simplicity of the problem posed, the authors are forced to admit that in the philosophical, scientific, professional literature there is no unambiguous answer to this question and, most likely, there will never be one, since the subject field of terminology is an unlimited space containing a large number of different scientific disciplines, professional areas and philosophical approaches; that each author, school, approach has its own specific view on solving a given problem. The authors identify three general approaches to assessing the disciplinary status and subject area of terminology in order to demonstrate the openness of each approach and the impossibility of limiting oneself to its own framework when organizing terminological work. The first approach understands terminology as a special area within any scientific or professional field, where every member of the scientific or professional community deals with issues of terminology. At the same time, he studies not so much specifically (professionally), but automatically, since he is simply forced to use linguistic means denoting the conceptual aspects of his own field of knowledge. The second approach considers terminology as a linguistic sphere, or more precisely, such an area as lexicology (lexicography). The linguistic component within the framework of this approach is presented professionally in terminology and terminological work, but linguists (lexicologists) are not specialists in the field of conceptual content of the subject area. The third approach presents terminology as a separate field of activity associated with the selection of terms from a particular field for the compilation of dictionaries, reference books, databases and knowledge bases within one national language, or within different languages. The key here seems to be the achievement of standardization of terminology within both one language and different languages. In this case, terminologists are neither linguists (lexicologists) nor representatives of professional (conceptual) fields. An analysis of each of the approaches demonstrates that each of the approaches faces the impossibility of taking into account the entire interdisciplinary range of terminological activities within its framework and requires a search for broader grounds. As such foundations, the authors propose socio-philosophical foundations as a basis for integrating the social, linguistic, professional, and terminological aspects of terminology. The choice is not completely obvious, but the authors give three justifications. The first justification is that socio-philosophical knowledge includes information about the genesis of society and the prospects for its development. The second is the importance of the axiological component in the activities of any community as a fundamental principle, which will influence any aspects of the life of society, including terminology. The third is the influence of social factors on semantic processes, conceptualized within the framework of analytic philosophy.
   When accepting socio-philosophical foundations as the basis for the integration of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary knowledge in the process of terminological activity, it becomes inevitable to use the methodology of a sociolinguistic approach in terminology, taking into account the interdependence of social and linguistic (terminological) changes.Thus, the authors believe that the socio-philosophical foundations of terminology allow terminology to function as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary field of activity and apply sociolinguistic methodology.

AB This study examines the behavior of the clergy of the Nizhny Novgorod Diocese regarding the revolutionary events at the beginning of the 20th century. It identifies instances of oppositional behavior and its consequences for the priests of the Nizhny Novgorod Diocese during the period of 1905-1907. The novelty of the research lies in the fact that, for the first time in this article, based on materials from the Nizhny Novgorod Spiritual Consistory, attention is drawn to the anti-government sentiments and actions of representatives of parish clergy of the Nizhny Novgorod Diocese during the first revolution. It is shown that oppositional behavior was not widespread but rather isolated. The author concludes that it manifested as a protest against social injustice, military field courts, in defense of peasants' rights to land against landlords, urging peasants to disobey authority, non-payment of taxes, church fees, association with politically unreliable individuals, liberal interpretation of the Manifesto of October 17, 1905, and so on. The author believes that the accused priests did not align themselves with a specific political party, except for Father I.I. Vladimirovsky, an archpriest from Arzamas and a deputy of the Second State Duma from the Constitutional Democrats party. It was found that 2 out of 4 cases against priests were dropped. Meanwhile, 3 out of 4 priests were punished by the diocesan authorities with a ban on serving or transfer to other parishes. The findings of this research can be utilized in courses studying the history of the Russian Orthodox Church.

AB The article is devoted to the role of the religious factor in the context of the socio-political development of modern societies against the background of military-political confrontation. The ongoing processes are an-alyzed at several levels - national, international, and ecclesiastical. Utilizing the post-secular paradigm, as well as actor and identitarian approaches, the authors examine the religious dimension of the Ukrainian crisis. They draw a particular attention to the situation in the world Orthodox Christianity. The authors reveal the reasons why the main line of cleavage in the modern Chris-tianity formed precisely in its Orthodox segment and was closely intertwined with the largest international political crisis of the first quarter of the 21st cen-tury. The article shows that the Ukrainian crisis has a destabilizing effect on the situation in the world Orthodox Christianity, reactivating old conflicts and creating new sources of tension. Having stated that the Ukrainian crisis served as a trigger and catalyst for dynamics in different spheres, covering a significant number of different types 113"& Pcy;& Ocy;& Lcy;& Icy;& Tcy;& Icy;& YAcy;"No 2 (113) 2024of actors, the authors at the same time point out that socio-political develop-ment in the context of the religious factor has deeper roots. From their view-point, the observed phenomena and processes indicate the formation of new models of interaction between the state, society and church within the frame-work of post-secular or traditionalist discourse, which in turn is associated with the rapid establishment of a new scientific and technological order. According to the authors' conclusion, as it already happened many times in history, the religious factor is obtaining key importance in determining the basic features of the new era. The transformation of Modernity into something else, which is taking place before our eyes, does not result in the "elimination" of this factor, but, on the contrary, transforms religious factor into an impor-tant component of the formula for a new way of life. The Ukrainian conflict intensifies the search for post-secular models of socio-political development in the Western political areal. At the same time, Russia and the West itself are moving in different ways, since the Russian model is closer to pre-secular practices.

AB In May 2022, Yoon Suk Yeol, representing conservative political forces, became the President of the Republic of Korea (ROK, South Korea). He advocated the speedy normalization of relations with Japan, giving priority to pragmatic cooperation between the two countries. The conservative ruling circles in South Korea are focused on developing and deepening cooperation with the countries of the collective West, including Japan, which share the values of liberal democracy. President Yoon considers Japan a "partner" with whom it is possible to counter common threats, in particular North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea, DPRK). His administration aims at the extended deterrence of its northern neighbor, the implementation of which recognizes the role of Japan within the trilateral format of cooperation between the ROK, the United States, and Japan. On the other hand, Yoon's administration emphasizes its intention to develop future-oriented relations with Tokyo, expressing its readiness not to raise controversial issues of the historical past. However, the issue of assessing the colonial past of the ROK as well as ones of building relations with Japan are an extremely sensitive matter in South Korean domestic political life. In this regard, it is relevant to trace the influence of domestic politics on the ROK's course towards Japan. The article shows that Yoon Suk Yeol's Japanese policy is part of the internal struggle for the formation of historical memory, while the opposition of conservative forces to the discourse of progressives also serves the purpose of legitimizing the political course of the current administration towards Japan. According to the authors, the propaganda-historical narrative of President Yoon indicates an attempt to move away from antiJapanese sentiment as a key element of the South Korean ideology. The authors examine the key characteristics of the Japanese discourse of President Yoon Suk Yeol, as well as the reasons that determined his policy of normalizing and strengthening relations with Tokyo. In conclusion, assessments are presented regarding the prospects for Yoon's pro-Japanese course and relations between Seoul and Tokyo, including in light of the results of the parliamentary elections that took place in the ROK on April 10, 2024.

DE ritual; social functions of ritual; initiation; secular ritual
AB This article attempts to trace the transformation of ritual in modern society under the influence of media space, Internet resources, social and virtual networks. The result of solving this problem is the identification of changes in the form and content of ritual. Possible ways of interpenetration of ritual and media space are considered. Ritual, which is the object of study of many sciences, is defined as a preserved sequence of actions with certain practical applications, or as a complex symbolic religious system. Being a symbolic system and language, ritual fulfills a social function - the formation of society. The symbolic content of ritual is associated not only with its mythical or religious worldview, but also with the ability to separate the ordinary profane from the sacred. The main function of ritual is the uniting of society. Thanks to ritual, historical memory is actualized, the social worldview is transmitted to all individuals of the group, and social hierarchy is built. Rituals of initiation and transition contribute to the definition of identity by an individual, a person learns and accepts his status and place in society. Ritual tends to keep society from disintegration, preserves it; being dramatically played, it re-presents the social, builds it up and encloses it from other social groups. Thus, it is possible to consider rituals forming generally accepted values as reference points for a person in social life that consolidate people. The article analyzes the mutual influence of ritual and media-virtual space on the example of Charles III's coronation ritual. The prerequisites for such a comparison are the ideas of F. Stahl and R. Rappoport, who describe the external form of ritual as performance. The article identifies three levels of the collision between ritual and media. Firstly, ritual in modern conditions moves as any event of human life to the level of media and the Internet, becoming publications on social networks, public and virtual pages. Secondly, it is possible to broadcast ritual to a huge number of people through radio, television, and the Internet, which gives the possibility of parallel translation, comments, discussions, clarifications, and references. Thirdly, media penetrate the very form of ritual as a way of performing it. Such characteristics of media as a special perception of time and place, a regulated form, social positions of participants, audience as a group, a bright expressive character, performance, a certain set of attitudes connect them with ritual, contribute to their interaction and transformation. Ritual, remaining an ontological part of human life, reflects social changes and influences their formation.

AB The article attempts to characterize Armenian society in the aftermath of the Karabakh War as a "society of trauma." The topic and its conceptual deliberation in frames of the "society of trauma", or a "traumatic society", is applicable to those modern societies living in conditions and after prolonged armed conflicts. Conducted between October and December 2023, the study utilized indepth interviews with individuals across different age groups and regions, expert interviews with professionals, and analysis of previous sociological studies. The study aims to uncover deep-seated value judgments regarding societal transformations before and after the war, factors influencing these shifts, the impact of ruling elites and foreign actors on Armenian domestic and foreign policy, and the overall dynamics of Armenian post-conflict society. Findings reveal a society grappling with declining trust in government institutions, pessimism about the future, nostalgia for the past, political apathy, and a reshaping of collective memory. The term "society of trauma" encapsulates these significant characteristics, reflecting the enduring impact of the conflict12.

   sociology
AB The rise of sociology as a science, reflecting modernization processes in society and exerting significant influence on them, developed during the post- Soviet period of Armenian reality. This development was facilitated by 'discovery' of sociology by the post- Soviet society and the close (though not always equal) interaction of domestic sociologists with Western sociological schools. Additionally, the participation of Western sociologists of Armenian nationality contributed to the formation of Armenian statehood as well as to growth of sociology as an academic discipline in Armenia. Under the influence of democratization processes, political sociology focused primarily on the transitional Armenian society, addressing the formation of power institutions and the utilization of political technologies. Regional dynamics, traditional and new foreign policy processes in Armenia, threats, and risks influenced the study of foreign policy guidelines within Armenian society. This also led to the formation and development of sociology of conflict and military sociology, closely linked to political sociology and sometimes inseparable. The effective managing of the Armenian state and society directly correlates with the integration of political sociology into political practices, and with demand for sociological knowledge, especially sociological forecasts, among decision- makers.

DE Immanuel Kant's pedagogical views; formation of subjectivity; human
   mind; open education
AB The article describes Immanuel Kant's key ideas about the conditions of effective education and about the formation of qualities in growing up people that allow them to maximize their abilities for the benefit of others (in modern terminology, their human potential). These ideas are reconstructed by comparing Kant's article "What is Enlightenment?" with his "The Idea of Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose", since in the latter he describes the basic mechanisms of cultural and moral development of humankind. Kant's views on the basic principles of "enlightenment" (including education) are revealed: (a) a person independently makes a decision about their enlightenment, regardless of the encompassing social circumstances; (b) the subject of enlightenment is the entire human race, since it forms new universal models of behavior and activity; at the same time, each individual representative is responsible for the acquired knowledge and abilities as a contribution to the overall viability of the human race; therefore, microsocial associations must be recreated or created within the framework of the educational process; (c) education is deliberately implemented within the framework of solving the most pressing problems facing society at a given time. The above-mentioned ideas of Kant about the organization of education for a long time were only a guideline for the development of pedagogical practice. Currently, they are mainly implemented within the framework of open additional education practices, due to the following methodological forms and pedagogical solutions: educational task, special positional organization of the educational process, and deliberate orientation of students to the development of a socio-cultural object. Using specially designed educational tasks allows: a) simulation for the student of the situation of the most significant achievement in a specific practical area, as well as reconstruction the way of solving problems peculiar to this area; b) the student's immersion in the study of key research or practical problems of the area of their interest, and then taking of a trial and practical action to solve one of them. The use of a special, positional organization of interaction between participants in the educational process allows modeling the collective, universal nature of education in accordance with Kant's ideas, as well as helping each student take their own position in the collective system of cognitive activities and consolidate their own responsibility for its results.

AB The article analyzes the official discourse of nation-building in three post-Soviet states - Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus. The process of "nationalization" of new states is not completed, and the analysis of authority discourse enables to evaluate how national elites, after gaining independence, choose the vector of nation-building and form a nationalist discourse. The purpose of the article is to identify common and specific features in the official discourse of nation-building. The hypothesis is that there is a common discursive base that links the trajectories of this process, as well as a specificity determined by the peculiarities of post-Soviet nation-building in each country. The study had for empirical basis the official messages of the presidents of the states and doctrinal documents in the field of national policy. Six nation-building discourses were identified, four of which - the civic, polyethnic, civilizational and sovereignty discourses - are common, ethnic discourse is present in Kazakhstan and Belarus, neo-imperial discourse - in Russia. The major coincidences are present in civic, polyethnic discourses and the discourse of sovereignty, and this makes it possible to record the presence of a common discursive base, although semantic articulations differ in each state. The most significant differences are observed within the civilizational discourse; in each state, civilizational orientations are determined by attempts to construct an image of its unique history and culture. Ethnic discourses in Kazakhstan and Belarus are not semantically identical, although they are built around the main theme for ethnonationalism - the theme of language. In Kazakhstan, this topic is highly politicized; in Belarus, it is part of a cultural policy, due to which the issue of "indigenous" and "non-indigenous" populations has been moved deeply to the periphery of the socio-political process. The main feature of Russian discourse is in this study the explicit neo-imperial discourse, which, on the one hand, emphasizes the state-imperial character of the Russian people, and on the other, strengthens the discourse of sovereignty.

The history of relations between the Turkish authorities and Turkish citizens, on the one hand, and the mountain people of the North Caucasus, on the other, includes three stages: the first stage (1919-1921), the second stage (1926-1929), the third stage (1930s). The criteria for these stages: the attitude of Turkish authorities to the USSR, to the North Caucasian peoples, the role of the descendants of the Circassian peoples (Muhajirs), who settled in Turkey during the 19th century. The author studies the role of the Turkish citizen - the grandson of Imam Shamil - Said Shamil. In 1926, he organized the People's Party of the Caucasus Mountaineers, which included representatives of the peoples of the North Caucasus who settled in Europe in the 1920s. During the Second World War and after Warthe peoples of the North Caucasus, who lived in Europe, moved to Turkeyfor residence. The author concludes thatTurkey during this period was not interested in supporting the North Caucasian peoples in their struggle for independence.

ID PHILOSOPHY
AB A model for representing the structure of narrative identity in the form of a hermeneutic spiral is proposed. An embodied subject is considered as an empirical "centre of narrative gravity", having a numerically identical body and possessing a basic ability for self-expression and reflection. It is argued that, empirically, narrative identity always presupposes the presence of an embodied subject capable of constructing his autobiographical statements in solving four practical problems: moral responsibility, realization of personal interest, compensation, and survival. The problem of replacing an autobiographical statement with a fantastic narrative is analyzed. It is suggested that the discrepancy between the model of narrative identity and substantial ideas about personality cannot serve as confirmation of the thesis about the anti-realism of the narrative model. Rather, the narrative model asserts the ontological openness of a subject capable of possessing dynamic personifying predicates. Since not every statement about oneself is part of a narrative identity, in order for a narrative identity to take place, it must pass the test of "restrictions", the consequences of which can lead to its cancellation or revision. The claim that narrative identity can be abolished, restricted, or redefined is the idea that identity is subject to elimination or transformation in a number of different circumstances, but remains unchanged when such circumstances do not occur. These circumstances can be defined by the " constraints" of narrative identity. This article analyzes different types of "limitations" of narrative identity. Two original "constraints" are proposed - "incarnation" and "plausibility". The presented "constraints" allow to more accurately define the boundaries of narrative identity and help prevent the relativization of the narrative, creating an opportunity to consider narrative identity not only from the point of view of reporting subjective experience from the first person, but also from the point of view of the second person, as well as a generalized point of view from the third person, defining it as a horizon of public symbols and meanings of culture.

AB The review by a Russian historian examines the collective monograph "Science of a Big Country: Soviet Management Experience", which was published in November 2023 in the publishing house of the Russian State University for the Humanities under the editorship of Doctor of Historical Sciences E. A. Dolgova. The authors (7 people) are specialists in the history of science, industry, technology and education, economics of science, sociology of science and its legal regulation. The book examines the process of formation and development of science and technology policy of the USSR for the entire period of its existence, as well as its transformation in the first decade after the collapse of the "big country" in a multidimensional manner. Particular attention is paid to the consideration of such features of the "socialist model" of science organization as its ideologization, state support of "big science", creation of the "cult of science" in the society, organization of breakthrough programs, scientific and technological independence, merger of science and technology, isolation of academic, university, industry and factory sectors of science. The book emphasizes that science in the USSR functioned in fact as a subsystem of the state, that its management was concentrated in state structures that sought to prove to the whole world "the superiority of the socialist economy over the capitalist economy". The authors did not set themselves the task of examining such important topics as the relationship between science and the authorities, between scientists and the political regime, and the impact of scientific and technological development on the Soviet society. They left out the repressions of the 1930s and the campaign to "fight cosmopolitanism and dissent" in the postwar period. Such an important sector of the field of knowledge as "military" science, which worked to ensure the state defense order, was also peripherally considered. As a source base for the study, the author makes extensive use of act material, office records of state and party authorities of different levels, sources of personal origin, journalism, and periodicals. The monograph introduces into scientific circulation a set of documents and materials identified in a number of Russian federal and departmental archives. The book consists of 9 chapters, conclusion, list of figures and tables, list of abbreviations, selected bibliography, name index and information about the authors. The monograph is an interdisciplinary study. It will be of interest to specialists engaged in the history, sociology and economics of Russian science, industry, technology and education, as well as to a wide range of readers interested in the history of Russia.

AB This study examines Soviet national policy towards nomadic peoples during the 1920s-1930s, a period when the foundations of national-state building in the USSR were being laid and developed. The research focuses on a specific region - Southern Russia, one of the most multiethnic macro-regions of the country. The study investigates the implementation of socio-economic and national policies of the Soviet state in the territory of ethnic minorities such as the Kalmyks, Nogais, and Stavropol Turkmen. Common specific characteristics of the nomadic population are noted: religious fanaticism, social isolation, innate closedness. Eradicating these negative qualities among the Kalmyks, Nogais, Stavropol Turkmen, and integrating them into the all-Russian space required authorities to adopt a differentiated approach to working with each ethnic group. It is proven that by implementing the national policy of the Soviet state through solving urgent socio-economic problems of the Kalmyks, Nogais, and Stavropol Turkmen, the authorities were able to achieve at least two main objectives to some extent. The first objective was to lift the mentioned nomadic peoples out of socio-economic crisis, mainly through stimulating and developing agriculture, despite the challenging natural-climatic conditions of the region. The second objective was to ensure the transition of nomads to a settled way of life.

AB This study addresses the demand for Russian higher education among Mongolian secondary school graduates. It identifies key aspects of Mongolian graduates' interest in the educational services provided by Russian universities. The relevance of this study stems from the enduring Russian-Mongolian relationship, marked by strong economic, military, political, and cultural, connections over a long period. Following a decline in the 1990s, Mongolia has recently regained prominence in Russian foreign policy. However, the appeal of Russian education has diminished, and Russia faces increasing competition from other educational systems in its "return" to Mongolia. The aim of the article is to reveal resources aspects of exporting Russian educational services, specifically examining the external potential of the educational system in the Republic of Buryatia, which borders Mongolia. This research explores the common educational strategies of Mongolian secondary students and their perceptions of the Russian education system. Emphasis is placed on analyzing official statistics in conjunction with our empirical data. The findings help to understand shifts in the attitudes of Mongolian youth towards Russian education, providing a foundation for predicting future socio-humanitarian interactions between Russia and Mongolia amid global changes.

TI URBAN PLANS OF EKATERINOSLAV VICEROYALTY: HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE AND

DT Article
DE urban plans; Ekaterinoslav Viceroyalty; architectural and urban
   development; second half of the eighteenth - early nineteenth centuries;
   city hierarchy; spatial borders
AB The second half of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries marked a period of significant urban restructuring, with the establishment of numerous new cities and the redesign of existing ones. These urban developments were meticulously planned according to the principles and ideals of Neo-classical architecture, a style that dominated the architectural landscape during this era. A considerable number of these cities were established in the underdeveloped and sparsely populated southern regions of Russia. This geographical context presented distinctive prospects for the implementation of an innovative urban planning policy. This policy was characterised by the creation of a geometrically precise urban layout, aimed at enhancing the quality of life and disseminating imperial cultural and political values. The focus of this study is on the cities of the Ekaterinoslav Vicegerency and Ekaterinoslav Province, which were founded in the 1770s-1780s, when the first plans for them were created. Confirmation of the plans did not take place until the 1810s and 1820s. The review study of the principles of the formation of the hierarchical structure and boundaries of the cities of the territory is based on the analysis of longterm plans from different years found by the authors of the article in archives, as well as published ones. The new cities of the region were devoid of a significant medieval architectural heritage. Consequently, when devising plans, architects and surveyors were granted greater autonomy in selecting compositional techniques and implementing the planning principles of Neo-classicism. The article analyses the characteristics of urban development in the territory of the Ekaterinoslav Vicegerency, with a focus on the identification of the features of the hierarchical structure and the spatial boundaries of the cities. The authors demonstrate a correlation between the urban layout and its administrative status, which is discernible within the framework of long-term urban planning. They also analyse the role of functionally different squares, the differences between central and peripheral buildings, the nature of the main streets in the orthogonal layout system and their connections with intercity roads. A particular emphasis is placed on the attitude toward the river in the urban layout, its role as an internal artery, and, in a manner more typical of the cities of the vicegerency, its function as a natural boundary of the city. Rectilinear ramparts, ditches, and other restrictive lines on city plans served to delineate the limits of urban space development. Assuming that this is the case, it can be posited that these elements are a manifestation of the principle of "timelessness" of the layout of Russian cities, as discussed in scholarly literature.

   law; national law; EU law; global competition; trade barriers;
   countermeasures; competition law; Draft Articles on; Responsibility of
   States for; Internationally Wrongful Acts
AB The unilateral coercive measures of states also wrongly called sanctions have occupied a significant place in law; the current state of the latter is analyzed. The complex set of legal rules have appeared concerning sanctions exactly, countersanctions targeted against them and their legal consequences as well as restrictions, prohibitions and exemptions caused by the sanctions policy. Lawyers have to deal with numerous conflicts related to the implementation of prohibitions imposed on already highly complex structure of the foreign economic activity's regulation. It impacted the perception of law from the point of view of systematic approach as soon as it needs to be determined what area of law the unilateral state restrictions belong to and what is the relationship between the national and the international legal regulation hereof from a formal legal point of view. The sanctions are considered by the author within the context of the correlation between legal systems and the logic of interaction between them. Nowadays the sanctions law is the combination of disparate legal provisions and practices allowing to use the sanctions as the instrument in the global competitive clash. Historical and comparative legal analysis methods enable to confirm that the terminological substitution happened at a certain historical point: the term "sanctions" began to be used in relation not only to measures taken by the Security Council under the UN Charter, but also to unilateral state acts. Dialectical and logical approaches allowed to trace the meaning and the purpose of the international legal regulation in the sphere of international trade and economic relations. It has always been aimed to remove any barriers and obstacles to the free movement of goods, services, capitals and labor. Therefore, an arbitrary and uncontrolled sanctions pressure contravenes the meaning and the purpose of the existing international law. The regulation of the unilateral state restrictions shall be interrelated at the level of legal systems and be based on the rules of the international law providing for the free trade and commercial exchange without trade barriers. The importance of the distinction between sanctions provided for by the international law and countermeasures as the means of states response to the violation of law committed by another state is emphasized. The author concludes that it is necessary to adopt the special international legal regulation regarding the conditions of imposing countermeasures, suggests to use the provisions of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility and substantiates the need for the establishment of the international competition law.

AB The article discusses the origins, the state-of-the-art and prospects of the new research field within critical geopolitics - popular geopolitics. The article aims to summarize the basic premises of popular geopolitics and demonstrate its relevance for analyzing, predicting and modeling modern geopolitical processes. Popular geopolitics focuses on geopolitical narratives that are translated through mediated images and objectified through mass culture products. It is precisely through popular culture, in particular through pop culture narratives that cross-cultural communication of the globalization era occurs. As part of this process cultural differences are either perceived as markers of otherness or, on the contrary, enable the consumer/spectator to reconsider the "self-other" boundaries and let the culturally attractive "others" in. As for geopolitical narratives, they introduce a clear demarcation between "self" and "others" by assigning to them opposite developmental trajectories that symbolize progress or backwardness, rise or decline, expansion or isolation. The authors of the article argue that a transmedia approach could make a valuable contribution to popular geopolitics. On the one hand, it enables exploring the totality of meanings forged and transmitted over social and online media through visual and virtual communication channels. In addition, the analysis of transmedia storytelling allows us to investigate in depth the role of content creators and content consumers in the production of narratives as well as investigate different ways in which official geopolitical narratives can be perceived by both domestic and external audiences. It is also argued that employing mixed methodology that combines qualitative and automated quantitative methods of textual and audiovisual data collection and analysis can help realize the interdisciplinarity of popular geopolitics. Thus, the authors come to the conclusion that popular geopolitics as a research field is relevant in terms of updating the research agenda of political science as a whole. As for the practical relevance of popular geopolitics, it lies in the active reconstruction of social reality that enables the representatives of Russian practical geopolitics to forge more effectively the national "imagined world" capable of engaging in a dialogue and resisting transnational narratives.

AB New methods in neuroscience, which emerged at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, allowed to make a breakthrough in comprehension of the human brain functioning principles, including the situations of ethical choice. The turn to the analysis of moral intuitions was so fruitful that it led to the flourishing of moral psychology, for which moral intuitions became the main research subject. Discoveries in neuroscience and moral psychology were bound to influence the areas of knowledge, where moral dilemmas and moral intuitions have traditionally been studied, primarily ethics and political philosophy. They have also affected political science. One of the most prominent and influential in its impact on ethics and political philosophy is the concept of deep pragmatism by Joshua Greene, based on numerous empirical studies of the human brain's response to ethical challenges. Another concept of equal and, potentially, even greater importance for these disciplines, and especially for political science, is moral foundations theory by Jonathan Haidt, which is also based on brain research and neural processes investigation. The article examines in detail Greene's research, which led him to articulate his own normative political-philosophical concept, as well as the concept of deep pragmatism itself. It shows that even though Greene attempts to distance himself from utilitarianism, his concept is, in fact, only a new iteration of the utilitarian theory of justice, which is inferior in terms of justification to other modern versions. In the final section of the article the author explores Haidt's moral foundations theory and its implications for philosophy and political science.

DT Article
DE geopolitical turbulence; economies of scale; phenomenon of strategic
   advantages; bilateral relations; potential
AB The article investigates issues concerning the development of countries amid geopolitical turbulence. In particular, it is shown that the development of the world economic system has two phases: monocentricity, with a leader country and the world order it has established; and multipolarity with an increasing chaos and the struggle of many countries for the reconstruction of the world. These processes are based on scale effect, which at the stage of multipolarity operates in the external sphere in the form of territorial expansion, and at the stage of monocentricity - in the internal sphere in the form of technological innovations within the corporate sector of individual countries. The paper considers the restoration of the phenomenon of strategic advantages, which barely manifested itself in the geopolitical space for a long time. To explain the cyclical rising of this effect, we introduce the concepts of independent (natural) and controlled (artificial) development instead of the concepts of outstripping development and catching-up development that are fading into the background; we show that artificial development exists in the form of acceleration and containment. This made it possible to put forward a political model of sovereignty "leader - satellites/opponents - neutral zone" instead of I. Wallerstein's technological model "core - semi-periphery - periphery". We propose and substantiate a quantitative criterion for strategic advantages, according to which they are observed under multiple differences (twofold or more) in the economic indicators of the compared countries. The framework study uses five indicators: area, GDP, population, technology level (GDP per capita), availability of nuclear weapons; the first four parameters are assessed quantitatively with the help of strategic advantages index; the fifth parameter is assessed qualitatively. We consider examples of the phenomenon of strategic advantages for bilateral relations: Azerbaijan/Armenia; Russia/Ukraine; South Korea/North Korea; India/Pakistan, etc. We also reveal the significance of this effect for Russia's long-term foreign policy strategy.

AB The article attempts to reconstruct the intellectual biography of the German historian, the founder of military history as a substantive direction of historical science, G. Delbruck (1848-1929). His large academic and journalistic heritage is still practically unexplored in historiography. Delbr & uuml;ck was not only a scholar-historian who proposed an original concept of the history of military art within the framework of political history from antiquity to modern times, but also an active participant in the socio-political life in the Kaiser's empire and in the Weimar Republic. Being a strong supporter of the monarchy, he criticized the Pan-Germans, the Polish minority policy, the Naval program of Admiral Tirpitz during the period of Wilhelmine Germany. The fall of the Kaiser's regime shocked him, but he supported the Weimar Republic as a "republican in mind." His biography reflected many of the contradictions inherent in German society at this turning point of German history.

AB The growing influence of information and communication factors on social selforganization, as well as the networkization of the structure of modern social movements, their "dependence" on Internet communication, their lack of a formalized structure, membership and leadership, determines the unpredictability of the solidarity actions of their participants. The transformation of digital communication into the basis of the communication mechanism of participants in almost all modern public associations acting, among others, under the slogans of global goals or frankly post-material motives, sets the task of finding new specific attributes and patterns of movements of modern virtualized self-organization, and determines the search for specific patterns of digitalized activism, as well as the definition of methodological grounds for their study. Within the framework of this article, such communities, whose participants interact mainly virtually on various topical issues of public discontent or are motivated by the desire for social justice, combining discontent with specific problems and general social injustice in their agenda, are defined as the newest or post-new social movements. In the article, the author defines the newest social movements as peculiar structures of self-organization, whose participants are connected by virtual communication rather than regular participation within a clear hierarchy, are motivated by a sudden actualization of problems of both material and non-material nature, and pursue the main goal of influencing political decision-making by the authorities. Referring to the data of all-Russian sociological research, the author examines the impact of digital communication on the current attitudes of Russians' mass consciousness, especially on citizens' readiness for civic self-organization and political activism. The author pays special attention to the study of the impact of the widespread use of the Internet and access to social networks on the demand for protest ideas by citizens.

DE theoesthetics; sacred architecture; hermeneutical approach; religious

AB The article provides a critical analysis and systematization of approaches to the study of temple architecture within the framework of interdisciplinary research that comprehends classical philosophical and religious approaches, as well as research at the intersection of sociology, cultural studies, aesthetics, psychology and architectural theory. Theoaesthetics is used as a philosophical basis, i.e. the temple as an aesthetic object is interpreted as the source and the habitation of all created perfection, which allows the "thing of beauty" to coincide with the truth of art and the truth of creation, manifesting itself in various phenomena - everyday life, culture, psychology, politics. The authors conclude that the beauty of the temple resists narrowing down to a symbolic series. On the one hand, the correlative nature of art history and religious studies approaches based on hermeneutics are shown (Understanding Architectural Studies by Stepan Vaneyan, The Hermeneutics of Sacred Architecture by Lindsay Jones, Hierophany by Mircea Eliade, the approaches of Henri Cobin, Ivan Davydov, Sharif Shukurov), and, on the other hand, the limitations of these approaches are shown in terms of criticism of the scientific method. Interdisciplinary research is represented by the architectural ontology of Mark Savchenko, the concept of Andrei Zabiyako, the research done by modern anthropologists such as Oscar Verkaaik, Mattijs van de Port, Markha Valenta, evolutionary psychologists Yannik Joye, Jan Verpooten. In these studies, the function of religious architecture is designated as overcoming and restructuring the symbolic structures that subordinate religious behavior and thinking of people. Scientists distinguish three modes of Christian temple architecture: (1) the material mode, where the temple is presented as a monument (Maurice Halbwachs, Pierre Nora, Jan Assmann, Aleida Assmann, Alois Riegl developed tools for comparing memory and history); (2) the semiological mode, presenting architecture as communication (Umberto Eco, Yuri Lotman); (3) the functional mode (Henri Lefebvre, Bert Daelemans). Communication theories are presented by Oleg Davydov and John Zizioulas, who apply the image of the "communion of the Holy Trinity" to the interpretation of the image of the temple. Representatives of ecotheology believe that temple architecture is inseparable from the environment (Evgenii Arinin, Sigurd Bergmann, Roald E. Kristiansen). After combining the results of various social and human sciences, entering the field of interdisciplinary research transformed the "meanings of temple architecture" into the process of "human creation of sacred spaces". Theoaesthetics made it possible to not detach the understanding of meanings from the theological content in which they were created, as well as to expand disciplinary boundaries, without losing the perception of the temple as a manifestation of "God's glory", as a complementarity of narratives and explanations telling about the infinite splendor of God.

AB This article examines the primary directions of contemporary urban development policy, along with the issues and contradictions associated with its scientific research and practical implementation. The study aims to conceptualize the concept of "responsible urban development" as a complex of approaches and practices that hold promise for integration into practical urban and regional development policies, and to typologize potential approaches to implementing such policies. The authors use an institutional approach, the methodology of identity studies, the structural-functional approach and a case study. The article investigates quantitative and qualitative indicators, the key challenges and tasks of urban development policy, with a particular focus on the resources of modern urban development. The authors note that relying on a limited set of indicators does not provide the capacity for decision-making necessary to update and transform urban development policy to ensure its ability to promptly and flexibly respond to the numerous problems and challenges arising under conditions of socio-political instability. The article addresses and analyses several cases of contemporary urban development and the implementation of corresponding policies. Based on this analysis, the authors conclude that one of the central and most pressing issues in the policy of responsible urban development and the socio-political dynamics of cities is the inefficiency of the communication process between civil actors and stakeholders, on the one hand, and city authorities and the city administration, on the other. This communication deficit can only be partially addressed through digitalization, as the primary obstacles to improved communication are administrative barriers and the dominance of the interests of certain groups, such as large corporations and financial institutions

AB About a decade ago, the global community came to the realization that progress toward sustainable development would depend largely on the successful mobilization of private capital. However, business has not yet proved willing to assume the leading role - especially in fragile contexts - largely due to increased political risks. This article identifies constants and variables in business' assessments of political risks over the 2010-20s based on selected serial reports summarizing the results of annual surveys of business representatives - Risk Barometer, by a global insurance company, Allianz, and How Leading Companies Are Managing Current Political Risks, produced by Oxford The article first examines long-term patterns and trends in business perceptions that manifested throughout the 2010s. The article then studies the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic and the increased global turbulence following Russia's special military operation in Ukraine in February 2022 had on these patterns. The research confirms the hypothesis about the existence of "constants" in the perception of political risks, despite the volatile changes in their geography, and identifies three consistent, yet paradoxical patterns: first, the clear underestimation of political risks in comparison with other risk categories; second, deprioritization of extra-legal risks and risks of escalation of interstate conflicts over non-military legal-governmental risks; and third, business' limited ability to foresee the most significant political risks of any type. Neither the COVID-19 pandemic nor the escalation of conflict in Ukraine have reversed these patterns. This can be explained by the lack of in-house experience and insufficient use of external expertise in political risk assessment, as well as by an overrepresentation of developed countries (and underrepresentation of the developing world) in expert pools. Improvements in political risk management and a broader use of political risk insurance (and guarantees) might increase the effectiveness of private sector resource mobilization for international development. However, in a much more competitive global environment, a higher propensity of companies from the competing powers to invest in high-risk jurisdictions would create additional zones of tension in the Global South - in the same way as do the official development finance flows. The article concludes by suggesting various possibilities of scaling-up fundamental and applied research in political risks (including their complex interactions with international development policies) based on regular business risk surveys to get results of high importance for Russia's current foreign and foreign economic policies.

AB The beginning of the 21st century is marked by increased attention to the problem of human intervention in natural processes. The avalanche of debates in the media and the Internet on a variety of issues from the safety of storing nuclear waste, the removal of landfills to regions remote from the places of "production" of garbage, the right of women to terminate pregnancy to mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 began to be compared in the intensity of passions with ideologically based conflicts and created a new type of conflict behavior, which is characterized by the transformation of any of the goals of humanity's joint survival into the basis of a unique ideology disseminated through social networks. The article searches Russian online networks for manifestations of radical environmental, anti-vaccine, and anti-nuclear post-ideologies. The research problem was the relationship between their social network and discursive characteristics. The methodological basis was a power-discursive program of research into networks and institutions as social objects. Its application allowed us to receive the following results. Firstly, vaccination discourse is extremist in all its parts, not just the anti-vaccine one. Secondly, the key role in this is that it includes and voices the power position directly from within itself. Thirdly, environmental discourse reaches the extremist agenda in the part where it serves to justify and organize direct environmental action. Fourthly, anti-nukers are currently either an imagined community or part of a network of environmental communities, which, due to a power context different from environmentalists, has the most likely prospect of becoming participants in the official discourse of nuclear safety.

DT Article
DE stability conflict forecasting; social tension; indicator of social
   tension; level of conflict; Southeast Asia
AB The article is devoted to testing the method of forecasting major conflicts in countries of Southeast Asia. The method is based on the assumption of the social tension growth in the last years before the event. Tensions are not definitely linked to protest activity. They contribute to sociopolitical or ethno- political mobilization, which can lead to the destabilization of society. Therefore, with high rates of tension growth in the country, the probability of serious conflicts increases. For a quantitative assessment of the social tension in the countries of Southeast Asia, the most relevant statistical indicator is the suicides number. We assume that the five-year growth rate of the tension indicator (the level of conflict) exceeding a certain threshold value indicates the possibility of major protests. The calculations carried out for the Southeast Asian countries made it possible to estimate the probability of major conflicts with an accuracy close to the machine learning methods. The use of the proposed indicator for the analysis of sociopolitical processes in the countries of Southeast Asia made it possible to explain their similarities in countries with different economic, demographic, political and cultural characteristics, i. e. obtain additional information characterizing in these countries the stability or conflict risk.

AB This paper analyzes the uneasy relationship between Tibetan and Soviet medicine in the period when socialist healthcare in the newly proclaimed Buryat-Mongolian ASSR was in the making. The study aims to reconstruct, trace, and provide new insights in the evolution of these relations from halfhearted acceptance to open denunciation. Dwelling on the understudied primary sources from the regional archives and on contemporary Russian historiography, the author highlights the attempts of Buryat scholars to whitewash Tibetan medicine, strip it from religious content, and introduce it into the secular field. At the same time, the article exposes the pitiful state of affairs in the nascent Soviet healthcare and explains why the Bolshevik healthcare organizers had to halfheartedly accept Tibetan medicine as a useful tool for providing basic medical services to the population. In compliance with the principle of historicism, the author points out the continuity between the eighteenth-century concept of medical police, which formed the core of state healthcare in Imperial Russia, and the concept of socialist healthcare, arguing that the need to fight against quackery inherent in both systems could not allow the Soviet physicians to tolerate Tibetan medicine. Providing the perspectives from both sides, the author shows how Tibetan lama healers tried to institutionalize their craft in the new political reality by replicating Soviet organizational models. However, as the author stresses, in the final analysis the lamas failed to secure official recognition of Tibetan medicine in Buryat- Mongolia as the People's Commissariat of Health continued its critique even though it did not openly oppose Tibetan medics. As the Soviet healthcare gained popularity and expanded its network, and as the collectivization was gaining pace, both Buddhist religion and Tibetan medicine increasingly faced discrimination and open attacks on the part of local Communist activists. Using documents from the regional state archive, the author traces how Buddhist clergy was intimidated, their activities suppressed, and their reputation undermined in local anti-religious campaigns. Even though formally Moscow disapproved of such actions, the author argues that such events marked the end of the period of uneasy coexistence. After 1930 the Soviet authorities, the Burnarkomzdrav among them, began to root out the Tibetan medicine and its practitioners. As the author concludes, in the wake of Stalin's industrialization campaign there was no place for coexistence as the Tibetan medicine hampered cultural transformation while the republic needed mass, uniform and ideologically Bolshevik healthcare.

DT Article
DE mathematics; logic; proof; Hacking; principle of relativity to means of

AB The article discusses the ideas about the rigor of proof in mathematics and the requirements for rigor in various mathematical directions and communities. It is shown that these ideas and requirements are set by members of such directions and communities, and depend to a great extent on their subjective preferences, up to sympathies/antipathies to particular individuals. These preferences concern the choice of basic principles (axiomatics), admissible/inadmissible abstractions, methods of reasoning (rules of inference), and the formation of fundamental concepts that are involved in certain proof procedures. Thus, the constructive moment plays an essential role in the genesis and representation of different directions in logic and mathematics. Therefore, this process is analyzed through the lens of Ian Hacking's idea of the "making up" (in this case, mathematical) of reality and its elements that constitute its ontological foundation. I claim the notions of rigor and requirements for rigor may also be covered by the "making up" procedure (in Hacking's sense). I suggest that the principle of relativity to the means of proof is legitimate in the philosophy of mathematics as well.

AB Referring to regional material, this article actualizes the tradition of studying the biographies of historical figures in the context of an institutional concept, which makes it possible to describe and explain the controversial facts of political history of the new time in the era of mass social movements. The authors aim to reconstruct the later imperial period (until October 1917) of the life of Grigorii Kondratyevich Ozhigov, a representative of the national revolutionary cohort, who took an active part in the events that occurred in the Urals, Ukraine, the Baltics, Finland, and other areas of the former Russian Empire in the late twentieth century. Methodologically, the work relies on the modernization paradigm, the "new social history", and related everyday discourse, including the anthropological approach, historical, and biographical methods. Since G. K. Ozhigov's biography studied by a few Ural historians is replete with inaccuracies, the study is based on sources which have never been referred to previously, including official documents, periodicals, sources of personal origin, autobiographies, and memoirs by Ozhigov himself. The documents kept in the fund of the Ozhigov family of the Central State Archive of the Udmurt Republic are characterized by a complex nature. The study demonstrates that Ozhigov, who came from a peasant family, a worker of Izhevsk factories, managed to rise first to the interregional, and in 1917, to the allRussian level, reaching the status of a member of the All -Russian Central Executive Committee of the first convocation. In the political sphere, he passed a difficult path of evolution from a militant of the Ural Lbovtsy partisans during the First Russian Revolution of 1905-1907, to a member of the RCP(b) and an active participant in the implementation of the project of the proletarian state.

DE repressions; street protest; Internet; number of protesters; long- term
   effect; triggering event
AB Although the relationship between state coercive measures and protests has long been studied in Political Science, there are a number of gaps in the modern research studies about the impact of repressions on street protest activity. A serious flaw in these studies is their focus on the influence of repressions on the existing protest campaigns, with little attention to their long-term implications. The impact of repressions on the scale of protest and number of protesters, as well as the role of the Internet as a factor mediating the impact of state sanctions on protests, is understudied. The article attempts to bridge these gaps. The author has first examined theoretical arguments in support of three possible forms of correlation between the severity of repressions and street protest activity - negative, positive, and parabolic (n-shaped), after which he tests relevant hypotheses on a sample of country cases that share the same trigger for protest - suspicions of electoral fraud. To test these hypotheses, the author utilized data on the maximum strength of repressions against civil society organizations, participants in protests and authors of anti-government messages on the Internet in the pre-electoral years, as well as data on protests in the first week following the elections. The study confirmed the influence of repressions on future protest activity. At the same time, the relationship between the severity of repressions and the number of protest participants in the long term has a quadratic n-shaped form: at low and high levels of repression, the number of protesters is minimal, at medium - it is maximal. As for the impact of the Internet, it was not detected on data on repression in the offline environment, but it was revealed on data on the strength of sanctions for political activity on the Web: if the share of Internet users in a country is low, repressions decrease the number of protest participants; if it is high, repressions of medium strength correspond to the maximum number of protesters.

AB Through an examination of the specific technologies of Soviet propaganda, the paper analyses the places and modalities of sanitation education in the USSR during the 1920s. Following Stefan Plagenborg's approach, the paper places analytical emphasis on the modality of sanitation propaganda. From this perspective, the propaganda technology used to educate Soviet citizens about sanitation is seen as a manifestation of contemporary trends in the 1920s that aligned with the new norms of the modern state. The text analyses four main venues for the implementation of sanitary propaganda: sanitary education houses with their lecture work, agit-trains and their travelling exhibitions, theatre stages with hygienic productions and special sanitary courts, and public reading houses and their sanitary work. The author examines the reasons for the successes and failures of these different modes of sanitation education. Depending on the place and form chosen, different linguistic and imaginative techniques were used in the method of health promotion, shifting the focus from theoretical reflection to understanding health practices in everyday human activities. The study demonstrates how a holistic system of effective sanitation and hygiene education technologies was gradually built up during the early Soviet era, drawing on different practices of medicalization of the population, performative and creative methods, and various prior experiences of socio-political information. The forms of sanitation propaganda and the various repertoires of sanitation education allowed Soviet workers to become involved in the processes of medicalizing society and to take an independent interest in protecting their health. Key words: USSR, history of medicine, propaganda, health education, public health, Ilya Strashun.

DE conditionals; connexive logic; constructive logic; logical semantics;
   implication
AB It is well known that in many systems of connexive logic not only the so-called Bothius and Aristotle theses are valid but also two "extra" formulas: (sic)(A -> B)->(A ->(sic)B) and (sic)(A ->(sic)B)->(A -> B). Henceforth we will denote them as (HBI) and (HBII) respectively. According to some specialists, it is possible to find an interpretation of these formulae which illustrates the fact that the content relation between the antecedent and the consequent in the corresponding conditional statements is broken. This means that these laws are undesirable in theories claiming to formalize connexive implication. Our paper proposes a way to modify Heinrich Wansing's approach to avoid this problem which is known in the literature as the problem of hyper- connexivity. The falsity condition of implicative statements used in the implicative-negative fragment of Wansing's logic C can be informally interpreted as follows: the falsity of a conditional statement arises only when the truth of the antecedent implies the falsity of the consequent. In other words, the negative semantic information contained in the consequent arises precisely as a consequence of the truth of the antecedent, and not simply along with its truth. It can be seen that in Wansing-type systems, the negative semantic information of a statement is not uniquely determined when the interpreter has positive semantic information. If the interpreter has been able to establish that the truth of a statement p is forced by the information state x, then this says absolutely nothing about whether the falsehood of p is forced by x or not. It is similar for the situation when the negative semantic information is available to the interpreter in the first place. This gives him no reason to judge anything unambiguously about the positive semantic information. When considering Wansing's condition, it is easy to see that it differs from the classical falsity condition not only structurally, but also in that it does not take into account the negative semantic information about the truth of the consequent. We propose a generalization of Wansing's condition by requiring that an information state forces the falsehood of a conditional statement only if any information state that forces the truth of the antecedent of that statement, when combined with the initial state, forces the falsehood of the consequent or does not force its truth. This modification allows us to show the refutability of principles (HBI) and (HBII), while preserving the general validity of Aristotle's and Boethius' theses.

DE Astrakhan Region; migration policy; labor resources; Great Patriotic War
AB This article examines the migration policy of the state in the Astrakhan region following its formation from 1944 to May 9, 1945. The study is based on materials from the archives of state and party authorities in the State Archive of the Astrakhan Region. The reasons, goals, content, and outcomes of the authorities' migration policy are identified. The number of migrants is established, showcasing the geography of departure points and migration directions of the population. It is demonstrated that during the final stage of the war (1944 - May 9, 1945), the migration policy aimed to provide labor resources for the fishing industry, new livestock farms, and government initiatives for the development of the Volga-Akhtubinsk floodplain. In the years under consideration, migrations occurred on a voluntary basis and were incentivized by state benefits. In 1945, during the organization of relocations from the Volga-Akhtubinsk floodplain, migrants were recruited from areas with climates and soil conditions similar to those of the Astrakhan region (Kazakhstan). However, the challenging material and living conditions in the settlement areas led to mass return migrations. The Astrakhan region was unprepared to receive and integrate migrants due to insufficient funding for relocations and local authorities' lack of attention to the needs of newcomers.

DE theory of motion; open intervals; Z-sequences; non-localized objects;
   Zeno's Paradoxes
AB In this article, I present the second part of the reply to Evgeny Borisov's critical remarks to my demonstration that - despite all attempts to refute Zeno's of Elea Paradoxes the conceptualization of motion still remains problematic, since one has to concede that a moving object at some stages of its motion is not localized in time and space, although this is extremely counterintuitive. I agree with Borisov's criticism and have to admit the incorrectness of my previous attempts to justify that in order to describe motion it is necessary to introduce such stages of motion in which a moving object exists, but is not localized in time and space. But in this article, I propose a new thought experiment that I hope - more successfully justifies the need to introduce such stages. Consider the following thought experiment. Let a point object be attached to a certain point by an elastic belt, so that for any point in the open-to-the-right interval [0 m, 1 m) along which the object intends to pass from left to right, there is a point at which the tension of the belt is greater. If it is accepted that infinite work cannot be performed in a finite time, then the moving object will not pass the interval [0 m, 1 m) during a finite temporal interval. Although it can pass each of the intervals starting at the point 0 m and included in the interval [0 m, 1 m) except the interval [0 m, 1 m) itself. But then the principle according to which "the interval [0 m, 1 m) is traversed if every right-closed interval starting at 0 m and included in the interval [0 m, 1 m) is traversed" is false. Meanwhile, this principle is a necessary condition for the truth of the statement that an object that has traversed the spatial interval [0 m, 1 m) during the corresponding temporal interval [0 s, 1 s) does not exist in the world in which the temporal interval [0 s, 1 s) has expired but the temporal interval [0 s, 1 s] has not expired. Since, as we have found, the aforementioned principle is false, by modus tollens we obtain that the moving object exists in the world described above. But any object can exist in such a world (or at the stage of motion to which this world corresponds) only if it is not localized in this world at some moment in time and at some point in space, Q.E.D.

AB The article discusses the study of the symbolic politics in the Russian Empire in national historiography over the past two decades. The author examines the theoretical foundations of research, terminology, and characteristics of various political science approaches, arguing that these tools can be applied to historical studies of the long 19th th century. These approaches help reframe the issues of cultural memory and commemorations, significantly expanding the source base for research and deepening our understanding of political and cultural processes within the Empire. An analysis of Russian historiography over the last two decades reveals a shift in research strategies for this issue, driven by the integration of foreign approaches to cultural memory into Russian academia. Through the use of various reference works as examples, the author describes the process of heuristic transition from a narrow understanding of symbolic politics as a minor component of the political process, to the idea of Aits versatility, multi-actor nature, and interconnectedness with cultural, national, and social issues. The final part of the article analyzes a monograph by Russian historian Ekaterina Boltunova relevant to this topic. By presenting an example of using political science and the "mixed" approach of R. Wortman, the book clearly demonstrates the prospects for studying the symbolic aspects of autocratic power's activities in connection with a wide range of issues of the national and cultural policies of the Empire.

AB The article reveals the features of the first year of functioning of the Anti-Imperialist League, formed following the results of the World Anti-Imperialist Congress in Brussels in 1927. Based on the materials of the organization stored in the funds of the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History, the author identifies three main meetings of the league's leaders to resolve organizational issues in 1927 (in Amsterdam, Cologne and Brussels). The article highlights important issues that were on the agenda of each meeting, ranging from issues relating to the structure of the new organization to questions about which associations should be included in the Anti-Imperialist League. The author also identified a few problems that the leaders of the organization faced in the first year of its activity and determined that the most intractable problems were those related to the financial support of the headquarters of the Anti-Imperialist League in Berlin and the functioning of the league for organizing national liberation movements in colonial countries. Another problem identified was the creation of league sections in imperialist countries such as Britain and the Netherlands. The article concludes that by the end of the first year of work, the leaders of the Anti-Imperialist League managed to approve a clear structure of the organization, create departments to ensure control over the finances of the league and include associations from the largest countries of Europe, Asia, Africa and America in the ranks of the organization, which allowed transnational connections of the Anti-Imperialist League.

AB The article analyzes the efforts of military political bodies to establish the production of military press and propaganda printed materials in the languages of the peoples of the USSR during the Great Patriotic War. The need for specialized publications arose due to the significant influx of fighters into the army ranks who did not speak or had little command of the Russian language. The stages of the development of the multinational military press in the context of political and educational workwith this contingent of military personnel are determined. The main decisions of the Main Political Directorate of the Red Army in this area are analyzed. The content of newspapers and other printed materials in the languages of the peoples of the USSR during the war is considered. It is shown that gradually the Main Political Directorate of the Red Army formulated a rather flexible and far - sighted approach to the publication of national newspapers, seeking to adapt their nomenclature in the military to specific target audiences - fighters and commanders of a certain nationality. For this purpose, permanent editorial and publishing teams were created, which were maneuvered from one frontto another, depending on changes in the national composition of the troops. The author concludes that by the end of the war, the attention to the national press from the Main Political Directorate of the Red Army had become much more intense, and the policy in this area was much more flexible in terms of nomenclature, circulation, volume and frequency. Attention is drawn to the gradual shift in emphasis from the publication of newspapers in the languages of the peoples of Central Asia and Transcaucasiato publications in the languages of Soviet Western ethnic groups (Ukrainian, Moldovan, Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian) and the languages of neighboring countries (Polish, Hungarian, Romanian). This is understandable, given the advance of Soviet troops to the west, accompanied by tectonic shifts in the recruitment of Red Armytroops: the representation of the ethnic groups of the Caucasus and Central Asia has steadily declined (especially since the autumn of 1943 their conscription was suspended), and the proportion of citizens conscripted from the liberated western regions of the countrywas continuously increasing.

AB The article considers modern approaches to the study of regional political branding, including the analysis of the technological support of political branding, as well as the procedural possibilities and limitations of its implementation. The technologization of regional political branding is of particular relevance in the postmodern situation, the indicators of which are the states of heterarchy, performativity, contextuality, discreteness and simulation. The communication strategy aims to support the innovation policy and its representation in relation to the target groups. According to the authors of the article, today, regional political branding is increasingly becoming the object of interdisciplinary research. In particular, it is actively considered from the standpoint of synergetics (the general theory of self-organization). Regional political branding in Russia should be of an applied nature and help the region integrate into the communication space with the help of professional PR, GR tools and modern political technologies, since the successful positioning of the region in the media space depends on this. The authors conclude that at the moment there is an active update of the main campaigns and concepts of regional political branding. Based on all of the above, regional branding can be generally defined as a strategy for transforming public space with the aim of subsequently transforming the socio-economic and political space. Based on scientific methodology and the use of the latest political technologies, regional authorities gain the opportunity to promote the development of territories through the possibilities of regional branding, to bring regions to a new level of economic and socio-political development; this also may be a determinant of the growth of the political influence of the Russian Federation in domestic and foreign policy.

AB The subject of this research is the activity of the Russian Orthodox Church, aimed at acculturation of the mountain peoples of the North Caucasus from the mid-18th to the middle of the 19th centuries. The goal is to analyze the role of the Russian Orthodox Church in the cultural construction of the North Caucasus in a specified period of time. The author considers the political-geographical, sociocultural determinants of the highlanders, contributing to the emergence of Orthodoxy. The novelty of the claimed topic is seen in the author's attempt to explain the causes and conditions of the Russian Orthodox Church's cultural mission in the North Caucasus region with the help of little-known-known archival and narrative materials, which to some extent fill the gaps existing in Caucasian studies on this issue. When developing the problem, the main emphasis is placed on a systematic study of the goals of the religious institutions of Orthodoxy, the state of their spiritual values, the methods of enlightenment of missionaries who are examined on the spot from the halo of mountain peoples and the political and religious situation in the region. A special contribution of the author is that for the first time a historical and comparative study of acculturation of the Russian Orthodox Church in various ethnocultural environmentsA- Ossetian, Ingush and Balkar- is proposed. Along with the introduction into the scientific circulation of new sources, an attempt is made to interpret the already known materials. The methodological basis of the study were modern concepts about the epistemological admissibility of using the methods and principles of retrospective analysis. The latter include: the principle of science (attracting a multifaceted source base), the principle of objectivity (the inconsistency of the educational activities of the Russian Orthodox Church in the region), the principle of historicism (studying the history of the religious life of the mountain peoples before they became part of the Russian state). The research methods were problem-chronological, which allow one to study the historiographic analysis of the topic, to outline the main stages in the chronology of the studied processes and phenomena, and retrospective, which help to penetrate the historical past, to reconstruct the various stages in the missionary activity of the Russian Orthodox Church aimed at acculturation of the highlanders. The practical significance lies in the fact that the reconstruction of the cultural heritage of the peoples of the North Caucasus, brought in by the RSP, will help scientists overcome stereotypes regarding the spiritual values of ethnic groups in Russia and provide modern politicians with interesting material that will contribute to a thoughtful and balanced consideration of topical contemporary issues related to interfaith tolerance.

AB The article examines a new, not very important from the statistical viewpoint, but extremely unusual flow of migrants from the former republics of the USSR, primarily Central Asian and, to a lesser extent, Transcaucasian. In the recent past a typical migrant in the Far East, as well as in Russia as a whole, can be described as a resident of a small city or village, who is focused on a short-term or cyclical stay in the region for the purpose of earning money and minimally interacting with the host community. However, the new flow of migrants includes residents of large cities who travel to Russia with an intention to integrate. For these types of migrants the usual economic push/pull factors do not play a significant role. The representatives of this group possess sufficiently high qualifications and did not experience any serious economic problems in the country of origin. The motives for their move are rather political in nature, and this is not persecution for dissent or participation in opposition activities, but rather what the authors refer to as the search for the Soviet people. According to the authors' conclusion, the emergence of this migration flow is associated with the growing process of ethnicization (as a form of nation-building) in the states of the post-Soviet space, which is increasingly becoming less post-Soviet. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the authorities of the newly independent states pursued an extremely cautious national policy, which was largely explained by the artificial nature of the contemporary borders of these states and their ethnic foundation. The former imperial cities, the previous centers of power, whose population most closely corresponded to the image of the Soviet people, preserved their high status. However, in the recent years the situation has changed. As ethnicization intensifies, accompanied by the ousting of the Soviet, which was equated with the Russian, the "debris" of the Soviet people lose not only their social status, but also the foundation for self-identification. They move to Russia in search of such foundation, with the hope to find confirmation of their own professional and socio-political identity.

AB The subject of the article is trends in Russian legal science. The aim of the article is to analyze and systematize the facts accumulating in legal sciences and science studies, which develop into trends that negatively affect the state of scientific jurisprudence, its categorical apparatus and practical significance, including for lawmaking and law enforcement. Methodology. The author uses historical, sociological, formal-legal, systemic and comparative methods. The main results. The following trends have been studied: substitution of the relevance and novelty of the topic with considerations of political conjuncture, scientific fashion and other pseudo-scientific considerations; Constitutional reforms as a new round of constitutionalization in the aspect of correlation between constitutionalization and interdisciplinarity of legal sciences; the danger of escalating the interdisciplinarity of legal research into the erosion of its subject; methodological eclecticism; weighting of scientific language, negligence and incorrect use of certain legal terms; misuse of foreign terminology; disunity of science and practice of law enforcement. Conclusions. Since the degree of practical implementation of scientific and legal research into legislative and law enforcement practice is too low, a more effective mechanism for analyzing and implementing specific proposals from legal scientists is needed.

The article systematizes the main approaches adopted by a group of researchers from MGIMO University, HSE University and the Institute of China and Modern Asia of the Russian Academy of Sciences, united within the framework of the "Moscow Project for the Study of Chinese Political Culture", to investigate the political culture of modern China through the monitoring of social networks. The authors analyze the existing ideas about political culture in the Chinese academic discourse, identify problems in studying the political views of Chinese citizens by traditional sociological methods (surveys, questionnaires). They further explain the relevance of using social network analysis in modern studies of Chinese society, and also describe the methodology they developed for studying social networks using sentiment analysis. The article lays the theoretical and methodological basis for further research on modern Chinese society based on an array of data from Chinese social networks.

ID POWER
AB The work through the lens of macrosociological approach analyzes the organizational forms of foreign power in ideological sphere of interstate relations between Japan and the countries of Central Asia. The author identifies and focuses on two most capacious organizational forms of ideological power in interstate relations, which were called "the power of SEC" (science, education, culture) and "the power of NGO". The two powers are distinguished into a special type - the heuristic forms of ideological power. The Japanese side manages to actively use these forms to amplify a social base of supporters of the development of Japanese-Central Asian relations. A characteristic feature of heuristic forms of ideological power is a wide range of social influence, where social interactions in the scientific and educational sphere aim to the deal-type impact with variety in authoritative-diffuse and intensive-extensive dichotomies, and the power of NGO has a pronounced authoritative-intensive influence on participants of relations between Japan and the countries of Central Asia. As a result, the heuristic influence complex creates goal-setting and individual motivation for Japanese-Central Asian relations based on the personal selfrealization of participants through their involvement in regular public social communication to satisfy personal needs. The Japanese side involves a large number of actors in the implementation of heuristic forms of ideological power: development institutions (Japan Foundation, International Agency for International Cooperation), government bodies (a representative pool of government ministries) and subnational actors (municipalities, regional governments and private companies). Such diversity makes it possible to attract a wide range of different levels of Japanese specialists into the country's international activities, which helps to distribute work in the ideological sphere among a large number of participants and more accurately select the appropriate social denominators for building more involved and motivated interpersonal contacts. The established institutional system supports a variety of social practices for the implementation of Japan's power of SEC, which identifies four main areas of effort: cultural centers, training grants, scientific events, and professional retraining programs. The Japanese side places a quality-based emphasis on interaction with representatives of the current or potential elitists, setting high-ordering selection requirements with priority on actual mid-level government functionaries and leaders in professional, scientific, youth, and cultural environments. Japan purposefully and effectively uses the ideological forms of power to strengthen its presence in Central Asian. The diversity of ideological forms of foreign power is a characteristic feature of Japanese-Central Asian relations, which forms its own logic of interstate relations between Japan and the countries of the region.

DE first-order modal logic; crossworld predication; CWPL0; semantics;
   tableau proof theory; completeness
AB Some sentences of natural languages, such as John might have been taller than Mary is, ascribe relations to objects each of which is associated with a possible world. In this example, Mary is associated with the actual world whereas John is associated with a possible world that can be distinct from the actual one. This phenomenon - the phenomenon of crossworld predication - cannot be reflected by means of standard modal logic. Recently, I elaborated a nonstandard logic accommodating crossworld predication; I shall call it CWPL (a logic for crossworld predication). CWPL is a first-order modal logic with equality; its formal language contains individual constants and lambda-operator. Semantically, CWPL is based on crossworld interpretation of predicates that assigns extensions to each n-ary predicate with respect to n-tuples of possible worlds rather than single possible worlds. Models for CWPL have varying domains. In CWPL's semantics, truth values of formulae are relativized, inter alia, to partial functions from variables to possible worlds - this enables us to employ crossworld interpretation of predicates when evaluating formulae. In my 2023 paper, I presented syntax and semantics of CWPL; in the present paper, I elaborate a tableau proof theory for a slightly simplified version of CWPL that I shall call CWPL0. CWPL0 is simpler than CWPL in following respects: it is a logic without equality, its formal language does not contain individual constants, and it is based on models with constant domain. In the present paper, a tableau system for CWPL0 is presented and its completeness with respect to the crossworld semantics is established. The presented tableau system is based on tableau proof theory for standard modal logic proposed by Fitting and Mendelsohn, but their proof theory is modified so as to be adequate to crossworld semantics. I also show that the simplifications of CWPL mentioned above are not essential in the sense that the presented proof theory for CWPL0 can be transformed into a proof theory for CWPL without loss of completeness.

ID KNOWABILITY; PARADOX
AB The principle of knowability (KP) says that all facts are knowable. The Fitch paradox shows that the logical representation (formalization) of KP by means of epistemic logic is not a routine task, and in the literature this task remains an open problem. Various formalizations of KP have been proposed and are being discussed in the literature. One of them was proposed by Dorothy Edgington. She represents KP by the formula Ap -> (sic)KAp (1) where A is the actuality operator. She intends (1) to be interpreted using the situational semantics in the spirit of Humberstone rather than possible world semantics. In a recent publication, I showed that her formalization of KP is essentially incomplete because she does not define the interpretation of A, and intuitively plausible interpretations in situational semantics, applied to (1), have counter-intuitive consequences. On the other hand, Edgington's formalization is based on some intuitions concerning knowability that should be reflected by any plausible formalization of KP. The most important of those intuitions is to the effect that knowability involves modal knowledge: saying that a fact is knowable is tantamount to saying that it is possible to know that in a certain situation (or in a certain possible world) the fact takes place. In one of my publications, I suggested formalizing KP by the formula p ->(sic)K(sic)p (2) that should be interpreted in terms of possible world semantics. In the present article, I demonstrate that (2) reflects the modal aspect of knowability more accurately than (1) and that (2) accommodates other intuitions lying behind Edgington's view on KP. Moreover, (2) has the following advantages over (1): it is based on a simpler semantics, and it has a broader sphere of applicability because it can be applied not only to actual facts but also to possible ones. I conclude that (2) is preferable. In my construal of KP in this article, I use the bimodal propositional logic containing alethic and epistemic modalities. In the modals of such a logic, knowledge is represented by the epistemic accessibility relation between possible worlds.

TI THE EVENT AS THE MANIFESTATION OF SUBJECTIVE CREATIVITY

DT Article
DE event; special event; organized event; event of interest; situation
AB The development of various aspects of social life gives rise to problems associated with the possibilities of modelling, creating events - in other words, the problems of a "special" or " organized" event. Having received a fairly wide distribution in the field of management, marketing, political science, etc., the concept of. "special" event is increasingly becoming the subject of research in philosophy. The second concept - an "organized" event - is introduced by researchers quite rarely and most often acts either as a synonym for the first one, or as the designation of a stage of production of a special event, although, in our opinion, it has a different meaning. The philosophers' new interest in this concept can be explained by the fact that the event is one of the most important dimensions of people's lives, it has a significant impact on social life, it helps to do public relations, achieve certain goals in the field of culture, politics, management, etc. In addition, the specificity of the special event is the opportunity to gain experience of living through the values that it translates to society. Since the "event" concept is generic in relation to the concept we are researching, we will consider its main characteristics through the relationship with other concepts close to it, that is, we will try to identify the topos of the event. Events or "natural" events (meaning events not directly organized by a person) have an ontological essence, and are unique. They lack a temporal dimension, structure, that is, they do not exist, but happen. They are characterized by surprise, suddenness and lead to a change in the state of affairs, to a new result, to profound changes. The event as such is not the fulfillment of the intended goal. The event is always involved in the life of people, even if it is a natural event. The involvement of such an event is determined by its significance for people, for society. Special events are events in which the main feature is their generatability, producibility and control by the subject-creator. They have a script and a storyline. They can also act as a kind of a replication of events that have already occurred and that are important for society. Such events are distinguished by the special role of the subject in the event. Researchers in the field of economics often equate the concepts of a special event and an event of interest, but researchers in the field of philosophy highlight their differences. The event of interest is characterized as a formal, emotionally and meaningfully empty action devoid of uniqueness. Its main function is to attract attention, which is secondary for the special event. The event of interest only creates the illusion of movement and change, and the special event stands out in a series of one-order phenomena, differs from them, violates regularity, changes observation laws. In addition, the special event has certain restrictions in time and space, since it is intended to be either a memory or to indicate a place, and this shows the value of the special event. The event of interest does not have such limitations - it can be organized wherever and whenever you want. As for the organized event, here, along with generatability and producibility, it is necessary to highlight the use of an emerging event or an event that occurred. Such events (as well as special ones) also have a purpose, an approximate plot, a plan. But the purpose of the organized event is not obvious; it is hidden, at least from the perceiving subject.
   The role of the subject (subject-creator) of the organized event is constricted: the possibilities of control (as in the case of the special event) are limited.

DT Article
DE Russia; China; USA; EU; energy security; security of energy supply;
   energy independence; security of energy demand; energy transition
AB The 2020s have witnessed increasing instability in energy security. The COVID-19 pandemic, which profoundly impacted the global economy and energy industry; the fierce confrontation between Russia and the West overthe war in Ukraine, which has significantlydisrupted global energy supplies; the ongoing tensions of tensions in the hydrocarbon-rich Middle East; and imbalances arising from the fourth energy transition are among the key factors destabilizing the global energy supply system, resulting in high volatility in energy prices. Countries' approaches to energy security remain largely conventional, focusing on three core aspects: security of energy supply, energy independence, and security of energy demand. This study comprehensively analyzes the current understanding of energy security by Russia, China, the USA, the EU, based on their fundamental doctrinal documents. The findings indicate that Russia, as a self-sufficient country and major energy exporter, views its energy security through the lenses of security of energy demand, security of energy supply, and energy independence. China prioritizes security of energy supply and strives for energy independence amid the energy transition, a natural approach given its critical dependence on hydrocarbon imports and status as the world's largest source of greenhouse gases. The United States, despite becoming a net oil and gas exporter, continues to prioritize security of energy supply and energy independence, with an increasing emphasis on security of energy demand. The European Union, critically dependent on hydrocarbon imports, focuses primarily on security of energy supply and energy independence within the context of the energy transition. While Russia, China, the US, and the EU predominantly view energy security defensively, the US and the EU also adopt an offensive stance. Unlike China, the US, the EU, and Russia politicize their understanding of energy security. Despite this, Russia and China demonstrate openness to international energy cooperation, whereas the US and the EU are more inclined to promote their energy sector interests through confrontation.

AB In her monograph "Jean-Lambert Tallien: the Unloved Son of the French Revolution" (Saint Petersburg, 2023), Senior Researcher at the Institute of World History of the Russian Academy of Sciences and senior lecturer at the State Academic University for the Humanities Daria Zaytseva traces the life of Tallien, a member of the Commune of Paris in 1792, Jacobin and Montagnard who became famous for being the fi rst to speak out against M. Robespierre on 9 Thermidor. Analyzing the various stages of his career and debunking Tallien's "black legend", D. Zaytseva comes to the conclusion that the hero of her research was in demand while the Revolution was going on, but he found himself out of place and died in complete poverty when "creators" were needed instead of "destroyers". Without disputing D. Zaytseva's conclusions, the author of the review suggests that Tallien was essentially a creation of the Revolution. It gave him everything: a position in society, respect, power. Without any profession, but with determination, courage and political views that were appropriate to the moment, he took his place among the political elite of France. Although he remains a very controversial fi gure in the eyes of posterity, he nevertheless entered history fi rst and foremost as the man who put an end to the policy of Terror.

AB The last decades have been marked by an increasingly widespread presence of irregular warfare in both international and internal conflicts. The most sought-after theoretical framework for understanding the nature and activities of irregular formations remains Carl Schmitt's Theory of the Partisan published in 1963. The article reconsiders Schmitt's criteria of partisanship and presents irregular warfare as a social phenomenon outside the social order maintained by the state, which potentially threatens the state despite their initial convergence of interests. The criminalization of the irregular combatant, carried out by the occupying force of the international conflict, might be continued by his subsequent criminalization by the social order which he had previously helped to restore. Although the Theory of the Partisan implies such an explanation, it does not fully develop it. The author identifies a reverse relationship between the internal politicization of irregular formations and their external criminalization: the occupant disregards the partisan's political motives, focusing on the criminal methods of armed struggle and considering the partisan as merely a flagrant disturber of order to be neutralized by police operations. On the other hand, the yesterday's hero can be declared a criminal by the regularity that previously provided him with support, if he converts the high intensity of his political commitment into demands to the regularity. Although such initiatives might be considered as a continuation of the political struggle by the partisan, they can be interpreted as a direct threat to social order by the state, which leads to criminal prosecution. Thus, the encouragement of irregular warfare is an effective means of combating external aggression in the short term, but in the long term it becomes dangerous as threatening social order. The author makes a conclusion about the indistinguishability of the political and the criminal under the full-fledged civil conflict due to the mutual criminalization of its participants and to the politicization of their criminal means of violence, providing some historical examples to show various manifestations of the criminal-political ambivalence of irregular formations.

DE Early Pythagoreans; Pythagoras; Lysis; Archytas; politics; democratic
   tendency; aristocratic tendency; values of the polis
AB The paper deals with the question of the socio-historical conditionality of the political ideas of the early Pythagoreans. It is established that the philosophy of the early Pythagoreans reflected such traditional values of the polis as political activity, patriotism, collectivism. The weak manifestation of individualism among the Pythagoreans testifies to the existence in their worldview of an indissoluble connection between the polis and the citizen. The political ideas and way of life of the Pythagoreans were conditioned by the flourishing of the polis system in the 6( th) -4( th) centuries BCE. The desire of the Pythagoreans for political stability and moderation was associated with the idea of a great danger emanating from anarchy and tyranny. The fear of lawlessness contributed to the formation of Pythagoras and his followers' idea of the importance of political loyalty. It was also found that in the political preferences of the early Pythagoreans manifested two tendencies - aristocratic and democratic. The aristocratic tendency manifested itself in the elitist nature of Pythagorean teaching, in adherence to aristocratic virtues and distrust of democratic practices. The democratic tendency was associated with the early Pythagoreans' idea of equality as the basis of laws, justice and friendship. It was shown that the changes in the correlation of these tendencies in Pythagoreanism were also conditioned to the socio-historical development of Greece in the late archaic and classical periods. The predominance of the aristocratic tendency among Pythagoras and his disciples was associated with the dominance of the aristocracy in the Greek poleis of the 6 (th) century BCE. The strengthening of the democratic tendency in the views of Archytas and, possibly, Lysis was due to the rapid development of democracy in the 5 (th) -4( th) centuries BCE.

AB The article considers historical aspects of the formation and implementation of the sociological education models in Russia. The model developed by N.I. Kareev and M.M. Kovalevsky at the end of the 19(th) century was to teach sociology to students of all areas of university training. In 1901, sociologization of social sciences started at the Russian School of Higher Social Sciences in Paris, and in 1908 it was improved at the departments of sociology of the V.M. Bekhterev Psychoneurological Institute and A.L. Shanyavsky Moscow City People's University. In 1918, P.A. Sorokin developed a professional model for training sociologists; until 1921 this model was implemented at the faculties of social sciences of the Moscow, Petrograd and Yaroslavl State Universities. In 1922, the implementation of both models was suspended due to the introduction of centralized plans to teach the basics of Marxism-Leninism to students. The creative potential of two historical models became in demand during perestroika, in the late 1980s - early 1990s, and new versions of the educational and professional models were introduced in the higher education in favorable conditions for the re- institutionalization of sociology. However, since 2010, there has been a gradual reduction in the number of sociological departments and faculties in Bachelor's-Master's programs. Today educational and professional models are unevenly represented in the Russian higher education; their implementation remains questionable due to the idea of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education to return to training students on the basis of the enlarged groups of specialties, i.e. sociology curriculum will have to be coordinated with curricula for regional studies, international relations, tourism and political science.

AB This article attempts to study the problem of the influence of irrational factors on politics and its reflection in the space of socio-political thought. Having started by identifying theoretical models of understanding the irrational in politics, the author fixes the theoretical and methodological framework, which is used by default when mastering the subject, and subsequently wonders: how else can the irrational be included in the sphere of political analysis and modelling? The author uses the texts of ancient Greek thinkers as the starting point. On their basis she reconstructs the basic set of approaches that form a conventional model to understand the role of the irrational in politics, and then highlights several features of the ancient discourse about the irrational. Firstly, this is the generative and teleological function of the irrational in connection with political reality: ancient thinkers primarily associated with irrational principles such matters as the origin of wars, power, law and the state, as well as the goals of political development. Secondly, the irrational factor limits the space of political subjectivity and, more specifically, free choice for a person and a citizen, because it is in the irrational field that the "last argument" is located. Thirdly, this is the trend towards the transition from metaphysics to psychology. Further analysis shows that this theoretical trajectory is preserved and consolidated within the framework of Western European political science discourse. Having established that the ancient Greek model of understanding the irrational is reproduced not only in discourse but also in practice, the author formulates an important question for political science: how productive are reflections that derive recommendations for socio-political coexistence from certain psychological human qualities or arbitrarily interpreted divine revelations? - and thereby invites the scientific community to revise classical approaches and to have an active dialogue within the topic. She proposes the concept of parallel discourses - verbal and non-verbal - as an alternative theoretical and methodological framework for the scientific study of irrational factors in politics.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB The impact of science on the development of society and shaping of cultural values is an important area of philosophical research. Currently, the transition to a post-technogenic civilization conditioned by the fast growth of artificial intelligence and human enhancement technologies is being actively discussed. Having included complex self-developing systems (human-dimension objects) in its field of attention, science has ceased to be a purely theoretical activity. The general trend of science transformation is integration with social structures and processes; the model of science as a theory has been replaced by a model of science as a social practice. Science, presented in the concepts of citizen science, "Protscience", post-normal science, is focused on the inclusion of public opinion in decision making process and assessing the impacts of the technologies deployment. The study of scientific rationality types is important since it allows us to understand the dynamics of science in culture. Today, an appeal to the context of post-non-classics is present in the studies of technoscience, STS, social assessment of technology, in the methodology of complexity, which is most in demand in conditions of uncertainty. The research given in the article is aimed at a deeper understanding of the essence of the concept of post-nonclassical science through identifying the features of the categorical grid of each of the three types of scientific rationality. A comparative analysis of the semantic content of the main categories of the conceptual framework of scientific paradigms allows demonstrating the integrity of each of the three concepts of scientificity, focused on the knowledge of objects of a certain type of systemic organization. The results of the study are also presented in the form of a table, which adds clarity and shows the semantic transformation of categories, demonstrating changes in worldview, scientific pictures of the world, understanding of the object, subject, methods of cognition, knowledge and criteria of truth in the classical, non-classical and post-non-classical paradigms of science.

AB After and during the inclusion of Central Asia to the Russian Empire, one of the pressing problems in the development of the region was the problem of slavery and the slave trade. Russian diplomat Nikolai Valeryevich Charykov, who was appointed to the post of diplomatic official under the Turkestan Governor-General, and then a political agent in the Bukhara Emirate, took an active part in the process of solving this problem. A variety of archival and published documents (reports, memoirs, epistolary sources) allow us to present a picture of his activities. Charykov's activities in Central Asia aimed at solving the problem of slavery and the slave trade were noted in Merv and Bukhara. In Merv, Charykov became a participant in its accession to Russia and the ban on alaman (robbery), and in Bukhara he became a conductor of the practical implementation of legal norms prohibiting slavery.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Norway; party system; neoclassical realism; sentiment analysis;
   international relations
AB The relations between Russia and Norway are of a contradictory nature, containing both positive and negative elements. In the scientific literature, the systemic factors affecting Russian-Norwegian relations are well studied, while the internal political reasons for the transformation of bilateral relations are insufficiently explored. In 2013, i.e. before the international political crisis of 2014, a number of studies noted the cooling of relations between Russia and Norway. At the same time, a center-right coalition came to power in Norway in 2013. The empirical base of the study consists of texts of debates in the Norwegian parliament and program documents of Norwegian parties. The article analyzed the collected data quantitatively and qualitatively. The main method of the quantitative analysis was a targeted sentiment analysis. As a result of the quantitative analysis, it was found that the parties in the center-left ruling coalition had a more positive stance towards Russia than the parties in the center-right coalition. On the basis of this qualitative analysis, three main factors determining the position of one or another party in relation to Russia were identified. First, the view of Norway's position within the framework of Russia-NATO and Russia-EU relations, which reflects the party's opinion about Norway's place in the system of international relations. Secondly, the value content of relations with Russia, which is connected with the ideology of party representatives and the presence of positive historical experience. Thirdly, the assessment of Russia as a threat to Norway's security. As a result, it was found that the left-wing parties are generally more inclined to consider Norway as a more autonomous and independent actor in relation to the EU and NATO than the right parties. This is due to the positive experience of the left parties in their interaction with Russia, as well as the higher level of importance of development issues in the northern regions of Norway. For right-wing parties, liberal values play an important role in the context of relations with Russia. In addition, they are more inclined to view Russia as a threat to Norway's security than the center-left and center-right parties.

DE posthumanism; literacy; smart technology
AB The presented study is dedicated to clarifying the issue of the possibility of forming the most adequate concept of literacy, which will take into account the role of IT in the life of modern society, as well as new discourses and social practices that have arisen as a result of its influence. Smart technologies are among the most advanced embodiments of IT. A specific feature of these technologies is a significant degree of autonomy from humans, i.e., the ability to respond to the environment in a way that promotes their endurance and prevents or resolves any type of failure, even in the face of uncertainty. Because of this, IT and smart technologies are increasingly becoming the focus of posthumanism theorists, for whom a key feature of the current cultural and historical context is the emphasis on the role of non-human agents, as well as the independence of some objects (especially those related to IT) from human activity and conceptualization. The aim of this work is to explicate the potential of posthumanism in the formation of a theory of literacy in the context of the spread of subjectivity beyond the boundaries of the human species under the influence of smart technologies. It is shown that, although posthumanistic theory arose quite a long time ago, and its history goes back many decades, nevertheless, the creation of theories and the construction of literacy models from the position of posthumanism have become part of the research interest of scientists only in recent years. At the same time, considerable attention was paid to justifying the very possibility of applying this theory to the study of problems related to literacy. The study shows that posthumanist theories view literacy as an active agent emerging from interactions between people, technology and other non-human agents, which opens up new possibilities for its theoretical understanding. Posthumanism has a theoretical-cognitive potential in the study of literacy, which manifests itself in a radical openness towards IT and smart technologies, and clarification of their role in the formation of new social and educational practices, as well as new literacy practices.

DE literacy; smart technology; smart literacy
AB The presented study substantiates the need to conceptualize a new - smart -literacy as more consistent with the systemic nature of the problems facing modern society in the context of the development of smart technologies. The research is relevant because smart technologies are increasingly penetrating into all areas - the production system, education, healthcare, trade, everyday life, etc. In this situation, a new concept of literacy is emerging, which should take into account the nuances that arise in connection with their implementation in various spheres of human life and society. Currently, the theoretical foundations for literacy research have been formed. However, each of the presented directions has both its advantages and disadvantages, which require special consideration and analysis. The work aims to explicate the content of modern approaches to understanding literacy and to identify key trends in the transformation of ideas about literacy in the context of the development of smart technologies. A contradictory picture is shown of the understanding of what smart technologies are: modern research literature contains many approaches to defining the concept of smart technology, and each of them has its own limitations and hidden contradictions, which leaves its mark on the difficulties understanding this phenomenon within the framework of existing literacy theories. In modern Western literacy studies, the introduction of elements of smart technologies into certain areas of life is still viewed more as an experiment with unpredictable results and consequences than as something accomplished and established. As a result of the study, trends in the emergence of a new direction in literacy research have been identified, the proponents of which consider the transition of IT to the state of smart technologies to be a fait accompli. It is characterized by an indication of the need for further understanding of literacy, taking into account the fact that smart technologies are forming a different technical and technological reality, in which more advanced tools and devices are used that radically improve everyone's quality of life.

DT Article
DE international relations; Japan; foreign policy; Russia; traditions;
   postmodernism; neo- modernism; nationalism; Abe
AB Political culture presupposes going beyond national borders to the outside world, it implies comparing oneself with other cultures in the mirror of socio-political values ("I am the other for the other"). Japan is a testing ground with an exceptionally rich texture for analyzing the influence of a specific political culture on the country's foreign policy. The author conducts such an analysis based on the methodological arsenal of comparative political science along the "modernity-postmodernityneomodernity" axis. The author critically examines the concept of the political analyst Andrey Kortunov who focuses on the transition of a number of countries from the postmodern development track, which, within the framework of globalization, led them to nowhere, to a more distinct neo-modern track with its pragmatic transactionalism and orientation to their original values. According to the author, Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe tried to break the postmodern deadlock, but then a breakdown ensued caused by the indecisive and reactive policies of weak leaders. Japan is "astride on the fence" with one foot in the globalist postmodernity, blindly following the lead of the United States, and the other in neo-modernity, trying to rely on national foundations and values. Using concrete examples from the current reality of Japan, the article shows how the constants of political culture transform the trends that determine the key vectors of international relations, including the negotiations with Russian leaders on the highest level.

AB The published materials are a review of the monograph by O.G. Klimova, dedicated to the organization of the study of the history of entrepreneurship in pre-revolutionary Siberia. The structural composition of the monograph, the theoretical and methodological approaches to the author's reception of the institutional forms of historiography, and the use of historiographic sources are evaluated. Particular attention in the review is paid to the author's ideas about the genre features of the representation of the history of Siberian entrepreneurship, the process of creating and functioning of scientific schools and trends, the reconstruction of the historiographic life of the scientific community based on the prosopographic method and the approaches of the new cultural-intellectual and new biographical stories. The anthropologically oriented format of historiography and construction of the scientific and communicative space of the historiography of Siberian entrepreneurship accompany the research of O.G. Klimova, which allowed her to identify the main "platforms" for the representation of the historiographic reflection of the history of Siberian entrepreneurship in pre-revolutionary Soviet and modern Russian historical science, as well as the ways for the scientific community to translate the ideas about the logic of the development of Siberian entrepreneurship in a long historical period. An important element of the monographic study was the author's desire to reveal the mechanisms and algorithms of research activities of scientists, which predetermined the author's desire to penetrate the inner world of historians, their historiographic life, revealing the social, political, ideological and cultural formations of research strategies of scientists within scientific schools and directions. In the process of working on the monograph and preparing a review, it was found that the work of O.G. Klimova is a serious scientific study, which basically solves an important research problem that contributes to the systematization of historiographic material on the history of regional entrepreneurship in the second half of the 19th- early 20th centuries. The version of the study of the genesis and historiographic tradition of entrepreneurship in Siberia proposed by the author can be perceived as an effective model for understanding and describing the contribution of scientific schools and their individual representatives to constructing the image of the region, taking into account a wide range of intellectual factors and approaches that have developed in the situation of the anthropological turn in the humanities.

AB The article examines the evolution of the technological sovereignty concept in the context of economic globalization, growing complexity of the high-tech sector, new geopolitical realities, COVID-19 pandemic, and the development of digital technologies. At present, key approaches to the technological sovereignty are protective function (restrictions against competitors) and the industrial model which stresses national technological independence (most important R&D competencies, production). The article argues that rising global technological interdependence and resource constraints limit efficiency of both protective and industrial approaches. The article highlights formation of a new << open >> technological sovereignty model, based on a system of international partnerships and coopetition (with geopolitical and other requirements included). Authors argue, that adaptation of the technological sovereignty concepts to the new realities is needed, as well as responding to the challenges of the "open" model, including its relationship with traditional political sovereignty, defining the criteria of technological independence, and goalsetting (security, global leadership, climate change, etc.).

TI "National Champions" and Technological "Little Giants": Chinese
   Industrial Policy Between Modernization and Tradition

DT Article
DE China; development policy; technology policy; national champions; small
   giants; national innovation system; matrix approach
AB China is confronting escalating geopolitical and socio-economic challenges, prompting a structural reorganization of its economy centered on the high-tech sector and emerging technologies. This article examines China's contemporary industrial, technological, and innovation policies within the context of global economic disruptions and domestic structural constraints. The relevance of this study lies in evaluating China's capacity to adapt to a shifting international environment, heightened technological competition from Western countries, and domestic pressures such as an aging population and slowing economic growth. The paper seeks to assess current strategies for the development of China's national innovation system (NIS) and critically analyze the transformation of its industrial policy. The central hypothesis posits that, despite outward signs of modernization, China's approach retains elements of traditional interventionism. Methodologically, the research draws on the theory of national innovation systems and elements of political economy, supplemented by case studies.These include an analysis of support mechanisms for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)-particularly the so-called "small giants"-as a key example of the implementation of the "national champions" policy. The study relies on official documents and relevant statistical data. The findings reveal that China's current industrial and technological policies are marked by ambivalence. On the one hand, there is a notable shift towards a more nuanced and multi- tiered support system, emphasizing incentives for technology-oriented SMEs and the development of advanced sectors such as integrated circuits, artificial intelligence, and renewable energy. On the other hand, elements ofa techno-centric and mobilization-oriented approach persist, with "national champions" continuing to play a central role in driving economic development. While the definition of champions has expanded to include SMEs, and the criteria for their selection have become more flexible, the effectiveness of this policy remains limited. The case of the "small giants" highlights the risks associated with the new policy framework. Looking ahead, the Chinese economy and its technology policies will continue to face significant challenges. However, the potential for transformative change appears limited due to mounting external pressures and path dependency, which predispose Chinese leadership to replicate established approaches.

AB This article examines the elections to the Constituent Assembly of 1917 in the Terek region. The study of this process provides valuable historical insights that can inform contemporary electoral practices, thus representing a significant scholarly issue. The objective of the research is to elucidate the specific characteristics of the electoral process within a national region. The sources include materials extracted from archival collections and regulatory documents. It is demonstrated that between February and October 1917, the Terek region experienced intense political competition, with each political faction proposing its own methods for ensuring regional stability. The local elite, having formed the "Union of United Highlanders of the North Caucasus and Dagestan," envisioned the region as part of a democratic federal Russian republic and did not oppose the policies of the Provisional Government. Leaders of the "Union" advocated for universal suffrage and equitable representation of the region's peoples in the Constituent Assembly. The conclusion drawn is that the elections to the Constituent Assembly had a profoundly positive impact on the development of political culture in Russia as a whole, and specifically in the Terek region.

AB The purpose of the study is to identify and analyze the problems of Russian-Chinese relations on the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) in the context of the establishment of Chinese power in the exclusion zone and the Soviet-Chinese confrontation over the ownership of the road. To achieve this goal, the historical picture of events on the CER is being restored, new historical sources are being introduced into scientific circulation, including materials on the history of the CER from the E. Kh. Nilus Archive of the Hoover Institute of War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University. The documents and materials involved in the study made it possible to supplement the historical picture of the events of Russian-Chinese relations in the exclusion zone of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and to considerthe problems of Russian migrants during the turning point in history 1920-1924. Throughout this period, the Chinese consistently formed Chinese state institutions in the Special Region of the Eastern Provinces, and the local Chinese public actively supported the policy of asserting Chinese sovereignty in the CER right-of-way. The Russian population of the CER right-of-way, significant in number and complex in composition, was dissatisfied with the abolition of extraterritoriality, but at the same time successfully integrated into the system of the Chinese state, without breaking ties with the Russian state, without losing traditional culture. In the new conditions, Russians on the CER retained their traditional way of life, freedom and material well-being. Mutually beneficial Russian-Chinese interaction ensured the political and economic stability of the Russian population in the Special Region of the Eastern Provinces of the Republic of China during the transition period of 1920-1924.

SO SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS

   policy; Zeitenwende; German parties; Bundestag; German-Russian
   relations; European security
AB The "Zeitenwende" announced by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in 2022 has seriously altered the German domestic political debate. For the first time since the end of the Cold War, German politicians have begun to put the issue of their own country's defense capability as one of the central topics of internal political discussion. The changes in the public debate provide a new perspective on the current trends in the political landscape, the changing balance of power and the prioritization of various topics in domestic politics. The author therefore aims to determine the place of the domestic German debate on military-political issues. For this purpose, the first objective of the article is to examine the evolution of the German public discourse around military issues, noting its limitations and marginalization. The second task is to study the development after the announced "Zeitenwende" in 2022, focusing on the deliberate politicization of this issue by the leading German parties, which for the first time in recent decades are forced to search for their own niche in military policy. The latest developments since February 2022 are examined through the prism of key party documents and government decrees, as well as public statements of leading politicians. The author assesses the orientation of key actors and the magnitude of their influence on political processes This approach allows to embed the study in the existing body of publications and adds novelty through the analysis of current documents. As a result, the author illustrates how the German military strategy, having become one of the central themes in contemporary German politics, immediately became a "bargaining chip" in the disputes between the parties.

DT Article
DE socialism; left populism; counter-hegemony; anti-capitalism;
   intersectionality; identity politics
AB The first quarter of the 21st century became a time of revival of the idea of socialism. However, the working class is no longer the assumed main subject of the progressive change. The rise of left-wing populism is replacing workers' movements and corresponding parties. The key feature of such populism is its desire to unite all the oppressed and exploited in the struggle against capitalist "hegemony". This attitude is reflected, in particular, in the idea of intersectionality, according to which different "systems" of oppression (racism, sexism, homophobia, etc.) and capitalist exploitation are intertwined and can reinforce each other. This idea leads to constant allusions to the general, so to say, "people's" struggle against capitalism and various forms of oppression. Moreover, some leftist theorists directly insist on the necessity to turn to populism and build strategies for leftist "counter- hegemony". The author thoroughly analyzes modern left-wing populist concepts and reveals serious flaws. The desire for justice and equality often disguises a thirst for privilege and radical hostility towards those who are viewed - often unfairly - as oppressors. Moreover, the struggle for socialism often means emphasizing freedom from labor for some, while ignoring economic hardships of others. The author classifies the contradictions of left-wing populism as insurmountable due to the impossibility of disentangling between the struggle for equality and for the private interests of individual groups. According to his conclusion, under the conditions when zero-sum games are inevitable, for the poor and socially vulnerable strategies for defending their own interests will become increasingly profitable and attractive in contrast to both populist projects and the idea of socialism per se, which increasingly implies the abandonment of these interests without guarantees of any returns in the future.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE the society of singularities; individualism; late modernity; middle
   class; neoliberalism; meritocracy; post-capitalism; social inequality
AB The article examines the concept of the "society of singularities" by Andreas Reckwitz. According to the German sociologist, in the post-industrial society of late modernity, the "logic of the general" is inferior to the "logic of the individual" - the singular: the greatest value is not mass goods and services, but those that have unique cultural and symbolic value. Representatives of the highly educated "new middle class" who have succeeded in the "singularity" era value creative individualism most of all and strive for self-realization, openness and cultural diversity. This combines well with neoliberalism and globalization, which, in turn, contributed to growing socio- economic inequality and growing cultural contradictions. Accordingly, Reckwitz seeks to point out the problem of excessive "particularization" of society and the loss of the "generality". Nevertheless, there is reason to believe that Reckwitz himself underestimates the problems he writes about and overestimates the positive aspects of "singularization". The article shows that Reckwitz's ideas about the "society of individuals", the "new middle class" and the meritocratic nature of the new elites are extremely controversial. In the most "singular" (creative, associated with individual creativity) areas of activity, the middle class is extremely small, and in modern Western countries the dominant cultural and political position is occupied not by the smartest meritocrats, but by those who are able to attract the attention of the broadest masses and meet their aspirations.

AB Introduction. Multinational Russia at various stages of its existence faces the playing out of the national question by opposing geopolitical centers. The discourse of "decolonization" and "deimperialization" of Russia has acquired a new level of relevance in the international arena after February 24, 2022. The purpose of the article is to identify and investigate the features of the destructive form of ethnopolitical mobilization in the regions of the Russian Federation through the construction and promotion of the discourse of "decolonization" and "deimperialization" of Russia by Western states.
   Materials and Methods. The materials used in the study include U.S. legal documents, resolutions of the European Parliament, publications and speeches of representatives of the Western political elite and scientific and expert community, materials of the United States Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, content of various organizations, foreign mass media and media foreign agents. The methodological basis of the study is represented by systemic, geopolitical and instrumentalist approaches, as well as such methods as monitoring, discourse analysis and content analysis.
   Results. The narrative of "deimperialization" and "decolonization" of Russia in the publications of the West-ern scientific and expert community and media materials is studied, and the political technologies of Western states oriented at the actualization of ethnic nationalism and, as a consequence, separatist tendencies in the regions of the Russian Federation are revealed. Western projects of practical policy oriented at actualization of national contradictions in the Russian Federation are implemented mainly through the following initiatives: holding events dedicated to "decolonization" and "deimperialization" of Russia; using representatives of Western-oriented national elites to actualize separatist tendencies in the regions of the Russian Federation; adopting declarations on "liberation" of the peoples of Russia from "colonial" dependence; popularization of information about the need for "decolonization"; and the use of the "decolonization" of Russia.
   Discussion and Conclusion. "Decolonization" and "deimperialization" of Russia are focused on the implementation of a destructive form of ethnopolitical mobilization and fragmentation of the Russian Federation along national lines of settlement. The authors identify five technologies for the formation of ethnic nationalism in the regions of the Russian Federation, which are used by Western states in the process of modern confrontation with Russia. The results of the study will be useful for public authorities at both regional and federal levels to develop a set of measures aimed at countering the playing of the "national card" on the territory of Russia by competing geopolitical centers.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of approaches to the study of the inequality factor in the revolutionary theories of the late XIX - early XXI c. With the collapse of the USSR and loss of the status of the only true Marxist paradigm in Russian science, a discussion unfolded regarding the prerequisites and causes of social unrest and revolutionary explosions, at the same time, in Western science it did not stop for a day. Inequality, as practice shows, was not given due attention. The issue was considered either in the context of economic problems or from the point of view of social imbalances. The phenomenon of inequality has a very complex nature, accordingly, its role is also great in terms of influencing the emergence of destructive phenomena leading to the dismantling of the current socio-political order. In this regard, it is important to make a cross-section of scientific approaches in order to get ahead of the level of knowledge of the topic and identify areas for further research.

AB This article examines the communicative strategies of the formation of civic identity by the system of political education institutions in Altai in the ideological space of 1945- 1955 based on regional materials. The authors employ the concept of constructing the phenomenon of Soviet society relevant to the modern neoclassical model of science. The source base consists of normative documents of the Central Committee and the Altai Krai Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, office materials of the propaganda and agitation bodies of the region from the funds of the State Archive of Altai Krai. The authors compare the reports of party committees with the information and analytical data of inspections of political and educational work in Altai. Materials of the All-Union and regional educational and instructional and methodical literature, and regional press were used to analyse discursive propaganda practices. Based on the theoretical and methodological approaches of social design and intellectual history, the article identifies the goals of creation, ideological and semantic motifs, symbolic components, and examples of normative behaviour spread among citizens. It is demonstrated that the production of standards of collective identification of the inhabitants of the region was based on the national-state narrative that rehabilitated the "Homeland" chronotope. The implementation of the all-Union project of social consolidation and support of the Soviet government in Altai Krai focused on the consistent inclusion of the official version of the past in the individual life experience by teaching political literacy, oral, and visual propaganda in schools and school clubs. A feature of the rear region was the construction, first of all, of identification samples of labour heroism. An important technology for involving the population in large-scale activities to restore the economic and socio-cultural potential of the USSR after the Great Patriotic War was the motivation of the feat as a mechanism for personal perpetuation in the memory of descendants.

AB This article analyzes strategic planning in Russia's export of higher education and the prospects for its implementation under the ongoing fragmentation of international relations. The purpose of the study is to assess how much the country's priorities have changed in the export of higher education and how these changes affected goal setting and geographical guidelines. The article uses a multidisciplinary approach, since the problem of exporting education is at the intersection of two research areas: international relations and foreign policy and higher education and the internationalization of higher education. The empirical material of the study includes strategic documents regulating foreign policy and the export of education, documents of ministries and departments of the Russian Federation, and statistical data on the state of higher education in the Russian Federation. The authors also analyze research publications, analytical reports, and other materials on this topic. It is concluded that the export of higher education began to be considered by the Russian government as an important direction of foreign policy after the start of the sanctions regime against the Russian Federation in 2014 and the actual breakdown of institutional cooperation with western universities. The geographic reorientation of academic cooperation of the Russian Federation with non-western countries is changing the priorities of the export of education, strengthening the political component in it and pushing the declared economic component to the background. The scope of available official statistics on the real volume offunds received from the export of Russian higher education make it difficult to assess the economic efficiency of this type of Russian activity on the global market. According to the report of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education for 2023, the stated quantitative goals for the export of higher education have not been achieved, although the problems that impede it are being addressed.

   dissemination challenges; political constraints
ID POLICY
AB The article explores the challenges that have emerged as open science practices have become more widespread. I suggest a classification of factors that may hinder the transition to a more widespread adoption of these practices. Open science refers to a set of principles and methods that aim to make scientific research in all fields accessible to everyone, benefiting both scientists and society as a whole. In recent years, funding agencies have been increasingly calling for a shift towards open access and other principles of open science. However, experience has shown that there are not only expected limitations but also unintended effects that can even conflict with the values of open science, such as equity and inclusiveness. Based on a review of secondary sources, the article proposes a typology of limiting factors that can be divided into five extended groups. These include resource factors, regulatory factors, institutional factors, cultural and educational factors, and motivational factors. A more detailed analysis of the emerging barriers to open access and open data has shown that each practice has its own set of challenges. However, resource and regulatory factors are the most significant in both cases. For open access, institutional factors have a more pronounced influence. On the other hand, motivational factors are a more significant obstacle for open data. The main pitfalls seem to be the growing stratification, the potential risks associated with the disclosure of personal data, and the continually increasing costs for publications in open access. The involvement of Russia in open science is currently limited by sanctions. This does not diminish the importance of promoting open access through models that do not require the transferof funds overseas. At the same time, it is important to expand the publishing in English. It would be beneficial to use the capabilities of the BRIGS countries in developing open data infrastructure.

AB The Syrian conflict, which began in 2011 and continues to this day, has led to a severe humanitarian crisis known as the Syrian refugee crisis. This protracted conflict has caused varying levels of violence and instability within Syria, forcing many people to seek refuge abroad. In this paper, I review the contemporary academic literature on the experiences, challenges, and integration processes of Syrian refugees. By analysing the complex and dangerous migration routes taken by Syrians, I highlight the numerous obstacles and difficulties faced by forced migrants both during transit and upon arrival. Using Germany as an example, I examine the reception conditions in the host country. I also consider the political and legal transformations that have influenced the movement of Syrian refugees. This review provides insights into the movement of Syrians across Europe and the methods used to obtain refugee status. I also analyze the changing political dynamics and the response of European countries to the significant migratory pressures. This review may be useful in anticipating and effectively managing current and future migration challenges, and in fostering mutual resilience and cohesion between displaced persons and host countries.

DE creative localities; social space; social interaction; metropolis; youth
AB Creative localities are a poorly studied phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. The authors, relying on Joas's concept of situational creativity, define creative localities as new self-organizing forms of social space, which are characterized by a certain localization and specific social interaction, which provokes creative processes that transform urban life. The article presents the results of a study of youth creative localities among Russian megacities using the example of two segments business (young startup people promoting their innovative ideas/projects; young specialists and heads of departments in innovative "advanced" companies) and urban creative activism (young organizers and volunteers of city events, street art festivals; young authors of creative "products" of city festivals and events; members of city communities engaged in micro-practices of transforming the urban environment). The empirical basis of the research is in-depth interviews with the agents of "making" a creative "product". Based on the analysis of interview data, the following conclusions are drawn. The main condition for the implementation of creative projects is the social micro-environment of direct interaction and support - a team, partners, like-minded people, a community. At the meso- and macro-environment level, the necessary conditions for urban activists are financial support from the state, local administrations, federal and regional businesses, grant funds, while maintaining freedom of expression and minimizing pressure from the authorities; for business representatives, this means information support from the state, financial support from private investors, and the presence of a politically neutral educational platform for the exchange of experience. Barriers hindering the development of creative localities are most significantly manifested at the meso- and macro-levels: for urban activists, these are misunderstandings, negative attitudes from residents and local media, the ongoing supervisory policy of the state, and restrictions on grassroots creative initiatives that accompany this policy; for business representatives, this is general socio-economic and political instability, closed access to global technologies, overall systemic corruption.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of discussions on the need to allocate separate representation for the Russian population of the Baltic provinces in the State Duma. The discussion took place during the development of the draft Regulation on the elections of 1905 and during the election campaign of 1906. For this region, despite the specific ethnodemographic and social distribution of its population, no separate electoral legislation was proposed. In disclosing the problem posed, archival materials of official office work, correspondence of representatives of the central and regional authorities are used. No less important is the characterization of initiative projects on this issue, received both from individual social groups and from political parties. Materials of central and regional periodicals complement the appeals of the local population, demonstrating the degree of demand for this issue in the public space by the Russian public. The main arguments intended to convince the imperial leadership were national disunity on the outskirts, the ability of onlythe Russian administration and Russian elected representatives to reconcile the Estonians and Latvians with the Germans. The threat of a revolutionary movement becoming an additional argument in favor of the need to strengthen the Russian presence in government bodies and local administration. The Baltic branches of the party "Union of October 17" became the most active participants in this discussion, referring, among other things, to the historical past of the region. However, for the imperial authorities, the criterion of ethnicity did not become the basis for changing the electoral law. It did not have a sufficient degree of transparency and could lead to an even deeper social crisis. In addition, the principle of nationality could be applied to most of the outskirts of the Russian Empire and would require a complete revision of the electoral law.

AB One of the key-points of the socio-political discourse in the Russian Empire in the XIX. early XX centuries was Slavic question. Ukrainian question was its particular manifestation. The aggravation of discussions on the Slavic issues, as a rule, followed the dynamics of foreign policy. Interest in the Ukrainian issue increased due to the adoption of censorship measures by the Russian state, which varied from tightening to softening of the censorship regime. The Ukrainian question in Russian socio-political thought was debated mainly in the discussion, if the Ukrainian ("Little Russian") ethnos represent an independent ethnic group or is a local version of the "Great Russians". Depending on the answer to this question, the ideal structure of the Russian state was going to be worked out. The Imperial St.-Petersburg Academy of Sciences took an active part in the discussion of the Slavic question in general (and that of Ukrainian in particular) and in the adoption of appropriate measures, acting as an expert body. Discussions were conducted not only at the institutional level, but also at the private one. In research literature, the scholarly world on this issue is divided into two camps, one of which (liberal-nationalist) was represented mainly by P.B. Struve, and the other. by his numerous opponents (for example, by F.E. Korsh). As documents from the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences show, the history of discussion on the Ukrainian issue before the First World War was broader, more scholars, also representing the Academy of sciences were involved. Documents introduced into scientific circulation demonstrate the position of member of the Academy V.I. Vernadsky. Differences in opinions did not prevent a respectful exchange of views, the most difficult problems of the development of the Russian state in light of Slavic question were stressed out, the drafts of certain possible solutions were debated.

AB The article examines the practice of communication between the population and G. E. Zinoviev, the first chairman of the Petrograd Soviet after the October Revolution, during the Civil War (1918-1921). Based on the material of written appeals to the leader ("letters to the authorities") the problematic components of the public image of the head of the local government and their solutions within the framework of Zinoviev's campaigning activities. Researchers had previously used this type of source mainly to reconstruct public sentiment in subsequent eras of New Economic Policy and Industrialization, without focusing on the importance of this form of dialogue with the population for the authorities themselves during the period of war communism, especially at the regional level. The article describes three types of written appeals: letters and notes received at meetings. Analyses of both type based on the peculiarities of the communicative situation in which the appeals were written: the possibility of establishing authorship, the proximity of the authors to the addressee at the time of creation, the format of the appeal and its goals. The study analyzed 349 records (142 letters and 207 notes) from G. E. Zinoviev's personal funds stored in the State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF) and the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History (RGASPI); in the funds of the departments headed by him during the specified period, in the Central State Archive of St. Petersburg (CGA SPb). For letters, the most common motives for their appearance are identified: the plight of the author and his family; dissatisfaction with the work of Soviet, party and military bodies; the desire to acquire a certain position in society (a place in the service, in the Red Army); the reaction to Zinoviev's speech or publication of employees-intellectuals. As an important underlying motive, the desire of the authors of the letters to establish personal contact with the leader through a meeting or to emphasize a previous acquaintance was revealed, which may illustrate a crisis of trust in society to the authorities or the lack of a culture of written appeal. The popular aspects of criticism of the head of the Petrograd Soviet contained in letters and notes are highlighted: privileges in the supply of food, the use of personal vehicles, Jewish origin and the discrepancy of statements with policy. In the final part of the article, Zinoviev's self-presentation techniques are analyzed in the context of the above-mentioned criticism. Such a characteristic feature is noted as the use of the letters received by the leader to demonstrate solidarity with the population, as well as the consonance of the claims made to him with his own criticism of the "attached" communists.

AB The 1990s is the neoliberal period of the H. Mubarak's presidential term in Egypt. It was the time of the economic miracle, when the GDP growth, decrease of the inflation rate, commercial relations development and the rise of tourism could be seen. However, this trend came to an end in the early 2000s. The 11th of September 2001 was a bifurcation point. After that day members of NATO began the anti-terrorist campaign. This was accompanied by military invasions in several Middle Eastern states and the attempts by the US to influence their governments to accelerate the democratization process. The result of such events is the deterioration of relations between Arab peoples and the West. Because of that Egypt came to the period of self- preservation, which is connected with the growth of social, economic and political problems leading to the disruption of its modernization. Another reason of such deceleration is named as conceptual crisis of the west-focused modernization type, which remained in the development basis of Arab Republic of Egypt (ARE) during 1991-2000 2000 years. It's impossible to readopt a model of the western democracies' life in the Egyptian society because of the resistance of its historical and sociocultural l foundation. At the same time the disruption of modernization, mentioned earlier, was making major changes in Egypt. In this regard, the current article focuses on the question of the possibility of changing modernization- from its western type to national type, which means that local cultural ral aspects and their synthesis with the world's modern technologies have remained the basis of development. Methodology of the study is based on the modernization theory (from S.N. Eisenstadt and A. Tourain's works), world-system analysis (by I. Wallerstein), in), E. Said's conception of "Orientalism" and counterculture characteristics from T. Roszak's vision. Sources for current research are from periodical press, statistical data (Egyptian and international) and also from documents of African Commission on Hu man and Peoples' Rights which belong to the period of 1991-2014s. Historical-genetic methods, historical comparative analysis, and systems analysis are among the tools used to study them.

AB This article discusses the question of how the personal element, which became the starting point of the movement toward individual thinking, manifested itself in the culture of ancient Israel and the culture of ancient India. The article attempts to describe the features of these cultures, which unlike the ancient Egyptian and Sumero-Akkadian, allowed to pass this way to the end. The process of formation of monotheism from the pre-state period to the great prophets is traced. It is noted that socio-political life, which determined with such force the status of man in a number of other Near Eastern cultures, in Israelite culture was subordinated to religious life, which otherwise determined the consciousness of man's status. In doing so, henotheism is gradually overcome. In the consciousness of the Israelite people the idea of complete dependence on God, who reveals himself through the prophets and establishes the requirement of a personal relationship to him, is established. At the same time, God, acting as a guarantor of justice, is revealed through the problem of theodicy, which can be posed only by a free personality. The movement of thought in ancient India turns out to be the opposite of what we see in ancient Israel: while the latter is affirmed through a long but persistent movement towards monotheism, Indian Brahmanism accepts the great diversity of divine reality and through the affirmation of its unity only multiplies the number of its components The decisive period for the emergence of individual consciousness was the period of the Upanishads. At this time, the deepened comprehension of the texts of the Vedas leads to the fact that a philosophical knowledge is built over religious knowledge. The specificity of Indian consciousness is determined by the long period of its oral existence, when the sounding speech in ritual or in the process of meditation acquires the key importance in the realization of the unity of the world. Individual consciousness is manifested in the process of concentration, directed towards understanding rather than mere reproduction of ritual mantras. The practice of asceticism played a role here. Just like in some other cultures in India real authorship emerges in the Axial period as an important sign of awareness of individual creativity.

AB The article examines the key issues related to the problem of terminology, conceptualization of the subject and object of religious policy research in the works of Russian authors in the post- Soviet period. The main methodological approaches used in the study of religious policy and its derivatives in the Russian scientific community are analyzed. The terminological variability of the concept of "religious policy" is considered and the terminological preferences of Russian researchers are revealed. The variants of the relationship between the concepts of "religious policy" and "state- confessional relations" are shown, and the need to consider religious policy at the levels of "political decision- making" and "political management" is justified. The approaches to the identification of subjects and objects of religious policy are analyzed and their dialectical interdependence is shown. The problem of subjectness of religious institutions in the formation and implementation of religious policy is considered. The author's version of the correlation and subordination of terms related to the definition of "religious policy" is given: "state religious policy", "state policy regarding religious associations", "religious policy", "confessional policy", "policy in the field of freedom of conscience". The approaches and methods of historical and political sciences in the analysis of religious policy are examined. The approaches used by Russian researchers to identify criteria for classifying religious policy are considered. Special attention is paid to the analysis of structural modeling approaches to solve the problems of identifying the principles of formation and implementation of religious policy. The conclusion is made about the prospects for expanding the methodology of religious policy research and the gradual institutionalization of this research area within the framework of the emerging discipline "political science of religion".

AB The article examines the influence of international legal system crises on the establishment and advancement of generally recognized principles and norms of international law. It is shown that the causes of crisis phenomena in international law can include inconsistency of the norms of international treaties and customs with the proclaimed principles of international law, poor regulation of the critical issues of the world community's life and its institutions; non-implementation of the enshrined principles because of the lack of political will or imperfection of international legal mechanisms. On the example of the principles of conscientious fulfillment of international obligations, the sovereign equality of states and respect for the rights inherent in sovereignty, non-intervention in the internal affairs of states enshrined in the 1945 United Nations Charter, it is shown how the principles undergo changes in different eras, resulting in shifts in emphasis and enabling the evolution of international legal regulation. The terminological discussions, which have spanned centuries, leading to a wide range of interpretations regarding the fundamental principles and norms of international law, including the concept of general recognition, are considered. It has been concluded that numerous principles of international law were established to address crisis situations in international legal affairs. However, sometimes, these principles can inadvertently exacerbate conflicts, as evidenced by the Europe-America tensions in the 19th th century. The primary areas of development for the international law principles are revealed: the alignment of specific principles in different international law branches with generally recognized principles and norms, the interplay between principles across different international law branches, which is crucial for regulating a substantial portion of international legal relations and the consolidation of judicial practice from international justice bodies.

AB The process of disclosing and investigating crimes provides for the need for a full-fledged forensic expert support in order to provide the subjects of the investigation with the necessary information and evidence in a comprehensive manner. The modern functional approach to the organization of forensic activities provides for the implementation of a comprehensive support work of the relevant independent units aimed at the production of forensic examinations and technical and forensic support for the detection, disclosure and investigation of crimes and other processes of countering illegal activities, implemented on the instructions of the initiators. This approach was formed considering the transformation of the political, economic and social situation in Russia, the progressive development of scientific directions, as well as changes in the needs of expert and forensic support of operational search and criminal procedural activities. The historical and legal study of the key directions of the formation of the institution of forensic activity made it possible to identify five main stages in the development of the technical, scientific and methodological foundations for the subjects of the application of special knowledge to support the processes associated with the disclosure and investigation of crimes. The genesis of the development of the institution of forensic support of the disclosure and investigation of crimes is considered considering the ideological, legal and social foundations of society corresponding to each time period, the specifics of introducing the achievements of domestic and foreign science into this activity. The findings made it possible to clearly demonstrate the evolution of the expansion of the competencies of subjects providing technical, forensic and forensic activities. They are largely due to the transformation of the tasks and functions of specialized units, changes in approaches to their direct structural subordination, the establishment of procedures for control over the activities of forensic units, the peculiarities of organizing interaction with other law enforcement agencies.

DE Joseph Stalin; Kursk-Orel dialect; Linguistic Debate; Alexei Sobolewsky;

AB In 1950, during the "linguistics debate", Joseph Stalin declared the Kursk-Oryol dialect the foundation of the Russian literary language. This statement puzzled linguists. However, due to the political situation, which did not allow this statement to be questioned, the postulate regarding the Kursk-Oryol lect was accepted as a cornerstone of the study of the Russian literary language until the denunciation of Stalin's cult of personality. The origins of this term remain unknown, although various theories were proposed from the outset. The first explanation, published in 1956, was suggested by Viktor Vinogra-dov. Following him, for over half a century, other hypotheses were put forth, all converging on the notion of Stalin's misunderstanding. The author of article argues that Stalin formulated the term deliberately, and that it was changed even under the influence of even such authorities as Sergei Ozhe-gov and Viktor Vinogradov. As evidence, the author presents a previously known letter from Garma Sanjeev on the issue of the Kursk-Oryol dialect, served in Stalin's archives. Regarding the term itself, the author hypothesizes that it originated from Stalin's or his aides' misinterpretation of information previously published in linguistic literature. To substantiate this, the article cites several points from the works of linguists, including Alexei Sobolewsky and Alexei Shakhmatov. Based on these works, the conclusion is drawn Stalin's formulation of the Kursk-Oryol dialect was derived from a misinter-pretation of Alexei Sobolewsky's theory, which identified the Old Kiev dialect as the proto-Great Russian dialect.

AB In 2024, the 90th anniversary of the attribution of the name of V.V. Kuibyshev to Tomsk State University took place, however, despite this, there is still no comprehensive study devoted to the Tomsk period of V.V. Kuibyshev's life. In Soviet times, V.V. Kuibyshev, as a hero of the revolution, was a popular subject of research works by Tomsk authors, however, the biography of the revolutionary was mainly presented fragmentarily, covering only certain stages of his life. On the other hand, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, publications and research dedicated to V.V. Kuibyshev were completely stopped. In this regard, the purpose of this work is to reconstruct the Tomsk period of V.V. Kuibyshev's life, since he subsequently became an important symbol in the structure of the university for more than half a century. A number of special historical methods were used as a methodological basis for the study, such as biographical, historical-genetic, historical periodization method, as well as historical-chronological. In the current study, the source base can be divided into three large groups: office materials, personal sources, and periodicals. The information collected from current sources allows us to reconstruct the existing biography of V.V. Kuibyshev, significantly supplementing with new, as yet unpublished information. As a result of the study, it should be noted that V.V. Kuibyshev was more connected with Siberia and Tomsk as a revolutionary than as a student. Therefore, during Perestroika, his role at the university was questioned and leveled. Weak connections with the educational institution explain the lack of a full- fledged biography and research articles about him. Nevertheless, when TSU was named after V.V. Kuibyshev, he took part in its life and felt a paternal responsibility. Perpetuating the memory of V.V. Kuibyshev is a good example of commemorative practices that contribute to the perpetuation of the history of the USSR and the formation of the identity of society, strengthening the ideals laid down in the foundation of the Soviet state. However, being a complex and ambiguous personality, he was almost completely "forgotten" during the perestroika period. At present, in our opinion, Soviet history and the leaders of the Soviet past require a certain rethinking, since they are part of our common history.

AB The digital singularity, positioned as a complex of sensational, sometimes paradoxical collaborations and innovations, is a stage in the new civilizational structure, which today is beyond human understanding. The contemporary generation becomes a builder and integrator of digital technologies of the sixth order that develops in combination with the metaverse and Web 4.0. Under the current political risks, post-pandemic recovery, sanction pressure, trade and information wars, increasing levels of cyber threats, and internal cosmopolitanization towards a multipolar world, leadership in the cyberspace development and the harmonious development of the information society become decisive for every country. Certainly, contemporary realities require a fundamentally new approach to developing the social-economic space and to ensuring the sovereignty of decisions. The study aims at identifying reasons for social polarization into network and digital segments and principles of the national trusted metaverse in the light of the social-economic space modifications. The authors conducted a study of the social perception of breakthrough innovations and the information and digital revolutions in Russia's North Caucasus and Southern Federal Districts (N= 21,348). The result of this survey is a polarization matrix of the information society and the concept of its digital transformation under the recursiveness and generativity of intensively complementary and successive innovations. The strategic guideline of this concept is the metaverse in the paradigm of the close connection between economic development and social regulation through the integration of digital space and physical world in the perspective of unique opportunities for the information- communication interaction in a single trusted environment based on high-tech solutions of the Web 4.0 era. In the new realities, the digital transformation of the social system is inevitable: the dissonance in the information society's perception of breakthrough innovations and the results of the information and digital revolutions indicate the inevitability of future changes.

AB At the Artificial Intelligence for Science: Synergy of Achievements panel discussion at the III Congress of Young Scientists that was held in 2023, the usage of AI technology was analyzed on the interdisciplinary level (Biology, Physics, Engineering, Political Science and Philosophy). In this paper, we have analyzed the functions of artificial intelligence in science at all stages of a scientist's work, from hypothesis formulation to experimentation and scientific communication. Previously advanced scientific tools were concentrated in state-funded research centers. The emergence of the artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputers is changing this paradigm: research and development often turn out to be in the hands of private companies. This state of affairs can be compared to a situation where half of the best modern microscopes would be in profitdriven organizations. The rapid development of AI has led to an intensive penetration of new technologies into scientific research, but at the same time has raised a number of concerns about their use. The new realities may cause a slowdown in scientific progress. In order to exclude this negative scenario, the authors of the article propose to consider the possibility of creating a separate scientific field of knowledge - Machine Epistemology, which would combine the philosophical approach and achievements in the field of AI. Such a solution, according to the authors, would allow us to most efficiently use new technologies to achieve progress in science and set ambitious tasks for hybrid interaction between scientists and artificial intelligence.

AB The brief report on the activities of the St. Petersburg Slavic Charitable Committee for the year 1869 includes a record that society members discussed the celebration of the 500th anniversary of Jan Hus and established a prize for an essay on the Czech religious figure. The inclusion of Hus in the list of "jubilarians" worthy of honor not only highlights the significance of this religious thinker for the Slavic world but also touches upon certain political aspects of Russian history. The article analyzes the reasons for the Russian public's attention to Hus's persona, provides a characterization of the views of Russian intellectuals at the time of the contest announcement regarding the legacy of the Czech religious figure, and presents reflections on how the proposal to support Jan Hus's 500th jubilee aligns with the tradition of honoring cultural figures in the Russian Empire by the mid-19th century. The material draws from both published documents and sources not yet introduced into scholarly circulation. The motives behind honoring Jan Hus's legacy are seen in the acknowledgment by the chairman of the St. Petersburg branch of the committee, Gilferding, of the Orthodox foundations of the Czech reformer's teachings, deeming it possible to use Hus celebrations as a lever of influence on Czech society and advance the idea of political and religious unity among all Slavic branches in Orthodox faith.

AB The article examines the events that unfolded in Italy between 1919 and 1923. Based on a large number of documents, archival sources, and literature, it explores the fierce struggle between socialists, communists, on one side, and fascists on the other, which culminated in Benito Mussolini's victory in 1922. The article analyzes the theoretical understanding of fascism as a phenomenon by the communists, as well as the development of methods to combat it, which were reflected in the congresses of the Communist International and the plenums of its Executive Committee from 1919 to 1923. The novelty of the research lies in addressing the issue of confrontation between left and far -right parties after World War I, during the formation of a new world order. The author concludes that the intensification of the struggle between the Communist Party of Italy, the Socialist Party of Italy, and fascism reflected a political crisis in Italian society and an attempt by radical forces to find a way out of it. Fascism, with its idea of a third way representing something between capitalism and socialism, came to power in Italy. The realization of their mistakes ultimately allowed the left parties to unite with all antifascist forces in the Resistance movement and defeat Nazism during World War II.

AB Contemporary informational society serves as a socio-technological interface between the global informational environment and human society. And that interface is constructed through the technologies of digital network-structured communications. The informational society serves as one of the few cornerstones of the globalization that would hardly be dismantled even in the radical crisis scenarios of global transformations will be enabled. Despite that the information society will be the object for increasing influence from the evolving environment of political, economic and socio-cultural nature. And at some point, that influence could alter the substance and structure of the informational society. The importance of correct understanding of the modern information society as an obviously incomplete object, capable at certain stages of its development of non-synergic changes without losing its socio-technological functions, is significantly increasing. That specific feature of the informational society is emphasized during the periods of the mosaicization and fragmentation of the social environment of the social environment. The destruction of the monopoly of the model of the social development that became a universal one during the period of the late globalization creates the space for the manifestation of the feature of the informational society.

DE Political science; historical approach; civilizational approach;

ID GLOBALIZATION
AB The article attempts to apply a historical approach to describe the challenges faced by political science in the 21st st century. The problems of political science are considered from the standpoint of recognizing and understanding the nonlinearity of the processes of scientific cognition, using the "challenge- and-response" methodology, in which the described challenges are external to political science. The article highlights three main challenges: deglobalization, decolonization, and demystification. Each of them has its own genesis, however, they all, to a considerable degree, overlap and reinforce each other. The challenge of deglobalization forces political science to reconsider significant scientific achievements and results based on the phenomena and events of the last 40 years, during which global processes seemed comprehensive and long-lasting. The accumulated amount of problems and failures associated with the liberal model of globalization makes this task not only necessary, but also very ambitious. The decolonization of knowledge calls into question the enormous amount of knowledge which emerged during the formation and development of the colonial system. Political science so far did not accept this challenge in all its complexity, but this choice will have to be made in the near future. Demystification, which radically reflects the confrontation between the scientific truth and "convenient knowledge", draws attention to the fact that "group epistemologies" in modern society often become more important than scientific knowledge. The article raises the question of whether there will be forces within political science to notice the identified challenges, soberly assess them and professionally respond to them.

AB The article characterizes the specific features and intellectual traditions of the scientific historical school of Lev Kertman, which influenced the development of the research strategies of his followers. In the 1960s, the school developed as a team of young researchers united by scientific interests, which were helped to form by an authoritative scientist and charismatic leader. As the school developed, its research fields expanded while maintaining intellectual traditions even after the unexpected death of its founder in 1987. The article uses materials from the scientific and cultural heritage of Professor Kertman, literature of a memoir nature, scientific publications by representatives of the Perm school, devoted to both historical subjects and problems, and broad sociocultural issues. This gives the authors grounds to draw several conclusions about the significance of Kertman's school. The authors believe that the influence of the scientific school was expressed in the focus on the sociocultural aspects of the historical and political process, in the fact that the person was placed at the center of the study both in history and in politics. The authors also see the significance of a scientific school in the moral impulse that was given by its founder and which helps to maintain research potential and motivation.

AB The main aim of the article is to reveal the features of representation of Cuba, depicted in the Soviet visual propaganda and mass perception at the background of the Cold War. The author emphasizes the contest of posters and caricatures of early 1960s, as the most significant, stable and intelligible form of retranslation of the political metaphors. Their quantitative and qualitative analysis allows detecting the role of Cuba in total information flow and tracing connection with the other contexts. Unpublished "letters to the power" from the archival funds give opportunity for assessment of the Soviet peoples' discourse solidarity with official world view and for research the case of public moods about Cuba as a new ally.
   Since 1959 the first visual feedbacks had appeared in the press. The enemies of revolutionary Cuba were visualized more intensively on the pages of newspapers. The Soviet cartoonists condemned the Cuban counter-revolution as well as its patrons from the US, whose images were also the part of more extensive anti-imperialist and anti-war propaganda. The heroic images of Cubans were depicted more deeply in posters, in 1960-1964 covering about 10% of all the available propaganda materials, devoted to international topics. The perception of Cuban issues by Soviet citizens was evident during the Caribbean crisis in 202 letters addressed to the USSR Council of Ministers. Most of them expressed approval, gratitude and support of the efforts of the governance for maintaining peace and security of mankind, also voiced the solidarity with Cuba at the background of aggressive actions of the US. Some of the messages ended in style of the posters' slogans. But some part of the letters gave more voluminous analytical judgments, including the contradictions to the official rhetoric. Either the need to get involved in a large scale confrontation against the US because of Cuba was denied, or the more rigid and consistent protection of the Cubans was claimed.
   In general, the analysis of the Soviet visual propaganda shows, among the national liberation movements of 1950-1960s the revolutionary Cuba was initially positioned as one of the main allies of the USSR by the vividly represented and regularly replicated heroic image of the Cuban people with typical symbolism. Also, the Cuban matter became the relevant context for increasing anti-American propaganda. According to the letters to power many of the Soviet people shared the slogans of solidarity with Cuba.

AB The article presents the results of a study aimed at determining the degree of influence of political attitudes on the formation of a positive civic identity of Russians. Trust in government and political activity are considered as political predictors of identity. The study was conducted with the participation of 1014 ethnic Russians, among whom there were 527 female respondents and 487 male respondents; the average age of the study sample was 41. The empirical study used the methodology from the International Social Survey Program to measure civic identity; scales of political trust and willingness to participate in political activities. It was found that Russians who participated in the study have a high level of trust in the president and the Russian army. The judicial system and political parties inspire less trust among citizens. It was revealed that the strongest influence on the formation of a positive civic identity is exerted by trust in the president, the government of the Russian Federation, and the Russian army. In general, indicators of political trust have a noticeably more pronounced impact on the formation of a positive civic identity of Russians than the willingness to take part in various political activities.

AB The article addresses the question of why, despite the seemingly long-standing accumulation of economic and technical conditions sufficient for building, if not communism, then socialism, the left-wing forces are unable to take advantage of this, and yield the initiative to the right-wing, conservative, and even reactionary forces. The author explains this situation by the rationale that the mindset of the left is still dominated by a flat liberal progressivism characterized by clich & eacute; ideas about the progressive and the reactionary, but it lacks tools to adequately assess the reasons for the "reactionary" sympathies of the broad masses and to admit that these masses have "grounds for concern" at the very least. As a theoretical basis, the article uses the concept of human prehistory of the classics of Marxism. The author demonstrates that the underlying dichotomy of the alienated and authentic, human and inhuman does not coincide with the dichotomy of "reactionary" and "progressive". The Modern Age is examined as both an epoch of reaction (in the literal sense of the word, net of ideological connotations) and that of progress. In order to resolve these issues, the author introduces the concept of retropractice, which is supposed to help adequately describe these seemingly "reactionary" and "con servative" sides of Modernity. Retropractices, in contrast to "reaction", possess an emancipatory and alienation-reducing potential. The flaw of the left is that they fail to comprehensively conceptualize the meaning of retropractices because they view them only as "reaction" and "conservatism" in the usual sense. However, socialism, if realized, will largely turn out to be precisely a set of retropractices.

AB The introduction of innovations into the system of local self-government and the replacement of electoral procedures with the "city manager" model actualize research into the processes of interaction between the population and new municipal leaders. The aim of the study is to analyze the factors influencing the formation of public trust in the activities of the city manager. The main research method was a survey of local government leaders (N = 188). As the results of the study show, Russian territories are characterized by a problematic background in the formation of trust in local authorities. Thus, 29.3% of respondents believe that the low level of public trust greatly limits the possibility of a territory's socio-economic development. More than half of the respondents (52.6%) chose the answer "somewhat limits". The survey found that replacing the electoral practice of selecting the head of a municipality with the procedure for appointing a city manager reduced the level of trust (58.0%). Correlation analysis established the existence of a statistical relationship between the lack of trust and the exclusion of pre-election communication practices between the authorities and the population. In addition, the following problems were identified: narrowing of the channels for articulating the interests of the local population (47.3%); fragmentation and speed of solving local problems without focusing on achieving strategic prospects and long-term objectives of territorial development (55.9%). Despite recognizing the problems of a lack of trust, city managers in their activities are more focused on the mechanisms of socio-economic development of territories, which presuppose the existence of trust and partnership between citizens and authorities (for example, attracting financial resources from residents for the implementation of infrastructure projects). To a lesser extent, new heads of municipalities (city managers) use in their practice mechanisms that rely on business trust in government (for example, municipal-private partnerships).

It has long been associated with thieves' cant, in which, according to A. P. Barannikov, the lexeme was gypsyism. Then the gypsy etymology began to be rejected. The purpose of the study is to fill in the gaps in the history of the word chuvikha using the methods of corpus and lexicographic analysis on the material of the Russian National Corpus, the collection of digitized books google.books, the diary service Prozhito.org, dictionaries of secret languages, slang dictionaries, etc. The following conclusions are made. Chuvikha, chuvak and a number of other slang expressions moved into the jargon of so-called stylyags (youth, passionate about Western culture) no later than the early 1950s from the jargon of restaurant musicians, so-called labukhs . Thus, the source of the argotisms of the stylyags was the slang of musicians, not thieves. Further, jargons of restaurant musicians of the 20 th century are related with the secret language of orchestral musicians of the 19 th century, having common roots with the slang expressions of labukhs, are given in the book. They are also related with other secret languages of the 19 th century. The words chuvikha and chuvak are possibly related to the lexem chovy 'good,' which was used in the secret languages of the 19 th century (with a variant of the root chuv- ) and in the aforementioned musical jargon of the 1920s as a substantive - the nomination of a person.

AB The aim of the article is to highlight the historical, philosophical and religious views of Fyodor Augustovich Stepun (1884-1965), a scientist, philosopher, Christian thinker, about the 1917 Revolution and post-revolutionary Soviet construction in Russia. The relevance of the topic is justified, and the necessity of its further study is emphasized. The author characterizes the corpus of sources, including Stepun's works of different years that comprehend this topic. The author emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of Stepun's research strategy that combines scientific methods of knowledge, such as the critical method, the method of ideal-typical construction, the biographical method, the method of philosophical criticism of literary texts, and the main provisions of religious symbolism, which implies the study of history in the context of higher religious ideas. Based on such an interdisciplinary approach, Stepun considered the revolution as a religious and historical tragedy of the Russian people and the Christian world as a whole, while paying attention to a careful study of the factual material. Stepun's ideas about the causes of the Revolution of 1917 are highlighted, in the structure of which he attributed a key place to the counterproductive policy of the Russian autocracy and World War I, which was unsuccessful for Russia. The complexity of Stepun's ideas about the February and October revolutions is emphasized. Attention is focused on his positive attitude to the February Revolution, the main goal of which was the democratization of the Russian political system. Stepun also accepted the October Revolution, which raised the world-wide theme of socialism, connected, in his opinion, with the Christian project of the transformation of the world. The thinker's ideas about the religious consciousness of the people as a factor of their political activity in the revolutionary epoch are analyzed. A positive attitude is observed. Stepun's ideas about the revolutionary game, in his interpretation reflecting the population's search for forms of social adaptation in the first post-revolutionary years, are considered. His deep rejection of Bolshevism as a political system with its God-fighting and class ideology, which contributed to the widespread state violence and immoralism in the country, is emphasized. It is concluded that Stepun's conception of the 1917 Revolution and Soviet construction in Russia is meaningful, and that it is relevant to contemporary Russian society.

AB The subject of the article is an overview of identitarian research results in Russia reflected in the cycle of the 2010-2023 fundamental scientific publications. The main result is the formation of an original Russian scientific school of identity studies and the establishment of this scientific area as an autonomous subdiscipline of political science. Two substantive dimensions of identitarian studies are identified - analytical-conceptual and substantive-political. Within the framework of the first one, the author analyses the key theoretical parameters of identity studies, including the substantive evolution of the identity concept, theoretical and methodological context and semantic explications of identity studies. A number of identity theoretical articulations are considered: identity modus operandi (positive, negative), identity crises, development, complex society, political space and political time, social justice, social solidarity, civilisational and geopolitical identity, memory and culture wars, cancellation culture, cultural security and cultural sovereignty, and others. An overview of prospective identity studies is presented, including the synthesis of micro- and macro-level identity analyses; the development of the middle-level theories as the way to bridge the gap between empirical analysis and "big theory" in understanding the changes taking place in different regions of the world, taking into account the historical past, political culture, emotional structure and worldview; the relationship between macro-political identities and ideologies; the correlation between civic and ethnic identities; and the relationship between identity and ideology. The political significance of identity research reflects the need to reorient the contemporary way of thinking as predominantly consumerist to the responsible development imperatives, which is supported by a positive identity.

DT Article
DE turbulence; world politics; security; defense capability; military
   policy
AB The article contains the description of the world political context that influences the evolution of the military-political sphere. The articles of the presented issue are devoted to this analysis. As a methodological framework, it is proposed to use the information introduced into scientific circulation by J. Rosenau in 1990, the concept of turbulence in world politics, which was developed in later literature. For an adequate interpretation of current trends in military policy, it is proposed to take into account the differences between modern conflicts and wars from their previous forms. In particular, it is appropriate to take into account the differences between total and limited wars established in the literature earlier. Another conceptual characteristic of modern wars is the theory of "world war" formulated in the doctrinal documents of the United States, in which military conflicts and their borders become indistinct, while the opposing sides include both military units and irregular formations. It is noted that for Russia, the security problem is historically a key problem, which is determined by the geopolitical location of an extended land state. The influence of this geopolitical circumstance was reflected in the configuration of Russian statehood with its traditional emphasis on a rigid hierarchy of governance, a strictly vertical decision-making algorithm and the centralization of the territorial structure, as a result of which hierarchization was not just an attribute of the historical evolution of Russia, but an archetypal form of organization of the country's political space. In the modern world, the matrix of social organization is changing: a network appears next to the hierarchy, which problematizes the lack of alternative hierarchical decision-making algorithm and actualizes the updating of security concepts.

AB Based on Soviet questionnaires of captured White General Staff officers of the early 1920s kept in the funds of the Russian State Military Archive, this article considers the problem of political self -identification of the "former" officers in Red captivity. The survey of former Whites was carried out to account for them. Sections of questionnaires about the prisoners' attitude to the events of the February and October Revolutions, as well as about their current beliefs were of particular importance for assessing their views. The analysis of questionnaires as a mass historical source makes it possible to get an idea of the sociopolitical position of the group of captured White General Staff officers. On most issues, the prisoners' views converged. As a rule, they accepted the February Revolution and did not accept the October Revolution. Also, they were highly critical of the old regime. Explanations of the reasons for the rejection of the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks are of considerable interest. For many, an acceptable answer was an indication of a lack of understanding of the tasks of the new revolution. At the same time, some pointed out the real reasons for such rejection, i.e. the Red Terror, the collapse of the old army, and the hard Brest peace treaty. The strategies used by the questionnaire compilers in answering acute and potentially dangerous questions draw the researchers' attention. Often, the answers indicated that the revolution was of a popular nature, and the author of the questionnaire sought to serve the people or welcomed the rule of the people and was in solidarity with the policy of the RCP(b). Some authors, not wanting to express their true views, declared the need to work honestly for the benefit of society. The "former" tried to give answers that would appeal to the new superiors and regulatory authorities, which would allow them to integrate into the command structure of the Red Army more quickly and remove from themselves the discriminatory status of former White officers who were on special registry.

DE youth; values; electoral behavior
AB The article examines the political values of Irkutsk youth and analyzes their impact on electoral behavior. The object of the study was the studying youth living in the territory of the city of Irkutsk. The focus of the study is a set of attitudes and values that influence the electoral preferences of the studying youth. The chronological framework of the study is 2021-2023. The relevance of the study lies in the fact that a low proportion of young people in Russia attend polling stations, and Irkutsk Oblast is a traditional anti-leader in voter turnout at all levels. Thus, in the elections of deputies of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the 8th convocation in 2021, the percentage of voters who reached the polling stations was only 36.59%, which was the lowest result in the country. In the elections of deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Irkutsk Oblast of the 4th convocation, the turnout was only 24.21%. Accordingly, the share of young people voting became low. The answer to the question of why this is happening lies in the value orientations of young people. After all, it is values that in many ways motivate people to act, especially politically. To obtain the data, a questionnaire survey was conducted among pupils of Irkutsk schools (grades 9-11) and university students. The number of respondents was 114 people (28 male pupils, 16 male students, 29 female pupils, 47 female students). According to the results of the survey, the main value groups among Irkutsk youth were identified. Thus, about 15% of students and 30% of pupils are " loyalists", about 25% are "hawks" (proponetns of greater radicalization), about 30% are representatives of "liberal" views and about 30% are " neutral-encouraging". About 15% of females and 30% of males turned out to be ready for political action, and students have a higher association between social activity of a citizen and participation in political actions than pupils. At the same time, the need for activism is generally present in more than half of the respondents in almost all groups. The electoral behavior of the above-mentioned youth groups clearly proceeds from their common value assumptions. Keywords: youth, values, electoral behavior

AB The article is devoted to the activities of the combines of the Leningrad Branch of the USSR Art Fund in the mid-1950s. The article is based on materials from the Branch's fund deposited in the Central State Archive of Literature and Art of St. Petersburg. The research approach according to which the material is analyzed is connected with the study of everyday life as one of the relevant areas of modern historical science. Researchers advocate the "chamber propaganda program" that operated in the art production of the USSR in the mid- second half of the 20th century. The material of the Leningrad Branch's fund allows us to trace the specific problems faced by the implementation of this plan in practice. Basing on this source, we reveal how reality corrected ideological attitudes. The focus of the article is on the activities of the Painting and Sculpture and Art-design combines of the Branch. The year 1956 was chosen as a chronological marker, as the moment of transition from one political and cultural period to another, from the period of "late Stalinism" to the period of "Thaw". The archival materials analyzed in the article allow us to draw the following conclusions. Firstly, the personal factor made significant adjustments to the work of the combines. On one hand, there was a struggle against bureaucracy and routine. On the other hand, policy on combating anti-Semitism was publicly announced. Both were supposed to demonstrate a new ideological atmosphere, "correction of the mistakes in the past". Secondly, an important role in the real participation of combines in the process of forming the living environment of a Soviet citizen was played by the distribution of funding in specific areas of activity. The most artistic trends related to the manufacture of applied art and interior design received the least money. The main funds were spent on direct propaganda and ongoing technical work. Finally, another factor of adjustment was the accepted system of wage payment. It made more profitable work not creative, but routine, related to the repetition of what had already been done earlier. All that complex of factors, of course, left its mark on the implementation of ideological attitudes and corrected the implementation of the "chamber propaganda plan". It seems that this trend of research may be of significant interest both for studying the activities of the enterprises of the USSR art industry, and for the political history of the country and the history of its everyday life. The scientific potential of the relevant archival materials, some of which did not attract the attention of researchers, is extremely great.

AB This article explores the evolution of methodologies in Cold War history research, drawing from previously published materials in the journal "RSUH/RGGU Bulletin. Series << Political Science. History. International Relations >>". The author emphasizes application of innovative research methods, such as the history of emotions, and the integration of unconventional historical sources, including video games. This is made possible by the journal's interdisciplinary approach, which combines contributions from historians and political scientists, fostering a multiparadigmatic perspective in Cold War studies. The thematic issues dedicated to the Cold War are particularly noteworthy for their efforts to move beyond traditional historiography, focusing on the influence of crisis events and the relevance of Cold War experiences for history of international relations. The article argues that an interdisciplinary approach is essential for a deeper understanding of international relations during the Cold War. The author asserts that the diversity of methodological approaches and the multiparadigmatic nature of the studies significantly enhance both Russian and international Cold War historiography. Furthermore, the article highlights the pivotal role of "RSUH/RGGU Bulletin. Series << Political Science. History. International Relations >>" in establishing an academic framework for Cold War studies and its contribution to the development of the scholarly community.

AB The development of digital literacy of all participants in the educational process is becoming an inevitable consequence of the digitalization of professional activities. Tomsk State Pedagogical University is implementing a project to identify the current level and profiles of students' digital literacy. The digital literacy model is structured on the basis of the DigitalCompSAT questionnaire, which presents profiles through five meta-competencies. The ecostructure of education includes various practices of cybersocialization that affect the level of students' digital literacy. Important agents of cybersocialization are subject teachers, computer science teachers, class teachers, teachers of ICT disciplines, heads of profile/course projects, specialists and teachers of institutions of additional education. Classmates, leaders of virtual communities, bloggers, gamers, and stimulators also act as agents of cybersocialization. Intra-family communication also plays an important role, especially at higher levels of education. The main objective of this article is to identify the role and weight of social practices and agents in the process of cybersocialization, as well as to determine their impact on the level of development of specific meta-competences of students' digital literacy. To reach this objective, a statistical interpretation of the data of sociological surveys of senior schoolchildren and students of the secondary vocational education system was used. Respondents were found to rate highly their meta-competencies related to digital content creation, digital problem solving, and cybersecurity. Based on the surveys, the following conclusions were drawn. Informal digital educational environment, including social media and peer information exchange, has a significant impact on the development of digital skills. Parents and close relatives play a key role in information literacy education, digital content creation, and digital device skills. School education forms "academic" digital literacy, which includes skills in working with programs and databases. Peers, friends, and teachers also influence the development of competencies, especially in the area of digital content creation. The results of the study emphasize the importance of informal cybersocialization practices in the formation of students' digital literacy. It is important to take into account all factors and institutions for the effective design of digital skills programs.

AB The study analyzes the problem of social loneliness. The theoretical and methodological base determines the significance of this phenomenon for modern society. In this regard, the issue of gender segregation in determining the factors of increasing social loneliness is extremely acute, since to a greater extent the marital and much less reproductive behavior of women can be associated precisely with the process of avoiding social loneliness as a social phenomenon, which requires clarification. Questions of studying social loneliness are also raised in the context of the need to preserve traditional family constructs. Modern social forms of avoiding social loneliness often form prerequisites for the distortion of family tradition and transform family and social forms of interaction. The article presents assessments of the phenomenon of social loneliness in the minds of women on the basis of a study. Social loneliness is considered in the context of women's marital and reproductive behavior. Concepts "social loneliness" and "happiness are compared within the considered subsample, differentiated by gender. The definitions of the concepts "female happiness" and "index of happiness" are given, a scale of assessments of the happiness index in the interval between two antagonistic terms is given, and the index is calculated for the considered subsample. The results are based on the author's empirical all-Russian study (N = 1075) using methods of econometric analysis of panel data. The results of the study are aimed at finding ways to reduce the risks of the formation of destructive socio-psychological constructs in women's perception of themselves and the world through the prism of social loneliness, and also contribute to the elaboration of recommendations for the development of sustainable family constructs of the traditional type.

AB The article explores the specific features of the UK strategic approach to policy towards Russia and China through the British establishment's perception of threats to national security. Based on the Intermestic Realism theoretical model, the author analyses how the broad domestic political discourse influences strategic tasks being formulated in foreign policy and vise versa. The demand for the protection of the democratic process as widely seen now to be threatened by authoritarian regimes, as well as the emphasis on the counteraction against some state actors, have brought about the emergence of new narratives in the UK. These trends affect decision-makers in the field of foreign policy, and retain the potential to influence strategic culture regardless of which party the Cabinet belongs to. In terms of the UK-Russia and UK-China relations, two trends are emerging, related to the discourse on malicious interference and attempts at foreign influence not only on electoral and democratic processes, but also on public opinion, and, consequently, on the mainstream domestic political discourse. New law enforcement practices formulated in response to these challenges, on the one hand, provide some leeway in UK policy planning, and on the other hand, confine the policy only to a threat-centered discourse, creating long-term hard line towards Moscow and an increasingly less flexible approach towards Beijing.

AB Task of the study is analysis of the specific features of political language of conflict during the revolutionary epoch. Such an approach helps analyze the processes of verbalization of violence, understand the logic of brutalization and social polarization. Without studying this problem it is hard to explain how the cult of terror targeting political adversaries became possible. The article examines the application of the concept of "terror" during the Revolution of 1917. Based on a study of speeches by materials of discussions at various levels, newspapers, diaries the author demonstrates what arguments were used for legitimation and delegitimation of the terror. The author of the article analyzed the processes of infiltration of culture of violence into the mass culture in 1917. The conflict culture, formed during the 1917 revolution under the impact of various factors (influence of the revolutionary underground subculture) increasingly widespread use of terror. The conclusion reached was that all political forces used the collocation "terror", and they utilized the fear of terror for their own purposes. Special attention is paid to the memory policy of socialist revolutionaries. The articulation of the terror became an important factor that prepared it - concept "terror" legitimised the use of violence, formalised and structured the increasingly political conflicts. The various crisis situations of the revolutionary epoch led to escalation of the struggle against enemies: destruction (political and even physical) of the adversary was described as the means for exiting the crisis. Influence of this cultural factor reduced contributed to the processes of dehumanization, alienation of the enemy, and set up a specific framework in which various political actors had to operate. In 1917, the language of violence spread, which had an impact on the course of the revolution.

DE gender; femininity; masculinity; gender stereotypes; glossy magazine;
   gender representation
AB The research aims to study the mechanism of gender differentiation in glossy magazines, which determines the motivational and value aspects of the life of men and women. It claims that glossy magazines are actively involved in the formation of gender stereotypes that correspond to the established gender system of society. Gender-oriented glossy magazines reproducing patterns of femininity and masculinity establish a gender regime, which guarantees the preservation of social order on the one hand and determines gender stratification on the other. The author focuses on the role of visual and verbal components of communication, which by means of the designation of statuses, roles and values of masculine and feminine behavior create gender inequality at the individual and institutional levels. As the sociological analysis showed, the representation of gender in women's magazines indicates the complication of gender identification, the emergence of new property and features of modern femininity, which reflects the dynamic nature of society. But the shift of emphasis towards fashion and beauty, the popularization of lifestyle in the context of recreational activities with a predominance of hedonistic forms significantly limit the range of social female roles in Russian society. In men's magazines, gender specificity is concentrated in the field of professional activity, which is responsible for the self-realization of a man that ideologically legitimizes masculine dominance. It can be argued that glossy magazines symbolically fix the gender display, focusing men and women on different life strategies, as well as ways to implement them. The gender asymmetry of modern Russian society is reproduced by using the mechanisms of social inequality (distancing, exclusion, hierarchy and exploitation) in the symbolic interpretation of femininity and masculinity. As a result, there is a differentiation of social positions of gender in various spheres of public and private life.

AB The article describes the formation of social and political views of the famous Asian researcher and public figure Grigory Nikolaevich Potanin. The author of the article traces the formation of worldview through axiology. The axiological approach makes it possible to identify the values and meanings of Potanin's life and explain his life choices in the scientific and political spheres. It turns out that Potanin's basic idea about the need for sociocultural equality between the colony and the metropolis and the possibility of provincial self-government did not leave him from the beginning of his studies in science until the last days of his life. The author found out that the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin played an important role in the creation of Potanin as a scientist, who helped him become a university student, at the same time he gave advice and books, and Potanin received Bakunin's thoughts, which helped him in the future. At St. Petersburg University, Potanin listened to lectures by N.A. Kostomarov, communicated with A.P. Shchapov and N.G. Chernyshevsky, visited museums, read periodicals, became acquainted with the advanced ideas of society, and learned French and German. In St. Petersburg, Potanin wrote articles about Siberia, in which he raised the problem of inequality between the capital and the provinces, met Siberian students, and together they made plans to improve the cultural and social standard of living in Siberia and create a program of Siberian patriotism. In the fall of 1861, during student unrest at St. Petersburg University, Grigory Potanin was arrested and imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress, where he stayed for some time, and then was forced to leave the capital, and ended up in Tomsk for a short time. In Tomsk, Potanin continued his activities on the cultural development of Siberia, published in newspapers, and taught in gymnasiums. Under the influence of P.P. Semenov-Tian-Shansky, Potanin directed his efforts towards science. But in the last years of his life, Potanin again turned to political activity; in 1917, he actively condemned the rise to power of the Bolsheviks led by V.I. Lenin, for this Potanin was declared an enemy of the working class for many years.

AB This article addresses the issue of verbalizing the semantics of ethnic disintegration (separation) and integration (unity) through terminological means. The study is based on an analysis of 40 combinations featuring the word "nation" and its derivatives, which are regularly employed in contemporary educational publications on Russian history from the 20th to the 21st century. The aim of this work is to describe the conceptual fields of ethnic disintegration or integration as represented by the terminological tools of educational historical discourse. Through a logical-semantic approach, the boundaries of the terminologies of disintegration / integration and their logical models are identified; the semantics of individual terminological units are described, including their axiological potentials. The structures of the conceptual fields represented by combinations with "nation" and its derivatives are delineated. The author concludes that the terms "national question" and "resolution of the national question" serve as foundational nominations within educational historical discourse, organizing the terminological systems of disintegration and integration. These terms are interpreted as opposing yet complementary fields that reflect the states of the nation and state in their opposition (political distancing of the nation from the state) or identification (political unity), encompassing a border zone filled with characteristics that facilitate the transition of the nation and state from one state to another.

AB While the term "Anthropocene" has gained significant attention, it is important to note that the discussion of its terminology and status has yet to be concluded. Over the past two decades, many narrower "Anthropocene" narratives have been proposed to describe particular aspects of the problem, including "Thermocene", "Capitalocene", "Technocene", "Urbanocene", and more. This article presents an analysis of the concept "Agnotocene". This concept explains the problems of the Anthropocene as a consequence of social mechanisms that create zones of ignorance where ecological criticism is discredited, the Earth's depletion is denied, and corresponding scientific facts are called into question. The Agnotocene highlights that the solution to environmental problems on a planetary scale is not only political and economic but also epistemological. It includes questions about the legitimacy, accessibility, and relevance of knowledge but also requires a deeper understanding of how and why some knowledge is ignored, devalued, or suppressed. The aim of the article is to establish whether the Agnotocene can expand our understanding of global social problems related to climate change. The article proposes the definition of the Agnotocene as a direction of Anthropocene research focused on social relations, which arise on the basis of or as a result of artificial ignorance. Its special task is to detect the types, forms, and specific ways of social production of ignorance that underlie human behavior in the context of global problems of the Anthropocene, to discover the evolution of ignorance and the current "modes" of its activity, as well as to look for possible ways to adjust it in the interests of the social and climatic well-being of mankind. As an example of Agnotocene studies, the article proposes two arguments based on this interpretation. The first follows from how science has maintained the illusion of a fourth wall between an expert community and a layman for a long time, which means that climate solutions requiring citizen participation are not perceived with the expected rigor. The second argument presents climate skepticism as a natural result of the cultural development of intolerance to ignorance and uncertainty within the framework of non-expert rationality.

AB The inclusion of volunteers in the emergency response system depends on the institutionalization of their activities, which affects the possibility of interaction and cooperation with official rescue services. This article, based on an analysis of government reports and interviews with volunteers operating in emergency situations (emergency situations) (n = 45), identifies three stages of emergencies in which the participation of volunteers is practiced, their capabilities and role in the development of the institution of emergency response. Stage 1 (Monitoring). General: analysis of data from official emergency services, creation of digital platforms. Search for people: selection of applications, analysis of geodata, collaborations with business, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the police. Fires: remote monitoring of fires, mapping of different types of fires and points of their prevention. Floods and earthquakes: monitoring water levels and seismic activity. Humanitarian disasters: monitoring hot spots, assessing required resources. Stage 2 (Strategic planning). Public education: schools, lectures, events. Training and recruitment of new volunteers. Training courses, schools, camps. Formation of resource technical base. Crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, equipment purchase. Collection of essential items for first aid, humanitarian aid. Fires: fighting peat fires, landscaping. Stage 3 (Response). Medical care; information/communication; shelter; logistics; provision of life-supporting infrastructure services; coordination and security; provision. The activities of volunteers in the field of emergency response in the Russian Federation should and can be effective due to several important factors: (1) the ability to solve specific problems, including narrowly focused ones, which together gives a wide coverage of types of emergency situations; (2) interest in resolving the problem due to a high degree of involvement (empathy); (3) high speed of response and accumulation of resources to resolve the situation due to less bureaucratic burden compared to the "lag" of regular services.

AB The protests of the youth of the immigrant neighborhoods in the fall of 2005 are an outstanding event in the history of the Parisian suburbs and in the political history of the Fifth Republic. Having begun as a local revolt, which fl ared up sporadically in the urban agglomerations of France populated mainly by immigrants from the countries of North and Tropical Africa, the events acquired the scale of a national uprising. They expanded to 300 communes, all departments of the Paris region, and responses happened in the east and west of France. There were thousands of detained and arrested participants, two hundred wounded police offi cers, thousands of burned cars. For three weeks the police and gendarmerie could not suppress the rebels. Some analysts, emphasizing the vandalism of the protests, call them "riots (& eacute;meutes)." Others, pointing to the scale of the protests, their duration, and the fi erceness of the confrontation with the forces of law and order, propose the term "uprising (r & eacute;volte)". Both explain the vandalism of the protesters by the lack of other ways for young people to express their protest. Historians have noted the similarities between youth protests and social protest in traditional societies. In both cases, the participants sought a demonstration effect to convey to those in power the depth of their indignation. The protests sometimes took the form of festivities, accompanied by emotional release, the acquisition of self-esteem and collective identity. The rebels drew legitimacy for their actions by appealing to moral values. The article traces how deeply the actions of the 2005 rebels could match the cultural and historical typology of archaic forms of social protest.

DE history; memory; historical memory; identity; revision of history;

AB Referring to the data of long-term sociological research by the Federal Scientific Research Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the author studies how the historical memory in contemporary Russian society is forming under the influence of the discursive politicization of the national past. The purpose of the article is to study either the images of the recent national past that are rooted in the mass consciousness of Russians being the basis of collective identity, or the changes in attitudes towards the past under the influence of the state rhetoric "historization". The realization of the scientific purpose involves to solve some research tasks: to study the dynamics of respondents' interest in the state's past when political leaders used to apply to historical memory, to analyze what people in Russia think about historical truth, about the ways and the actors of its protection. Under the contemporary political context, when the past and history become tools of political competition, many persons in Russia, for whom the Soviet heritage is the foundation of national identity and family memory, support the idea of the need to protect the socially accepted interpretation of Russian history. In 2020'th the majority of the respondents (37%) claimed the need to react harshly to the distorted interpretation of some events in Russian history when whey answered the question "How should Russia react to the false interpretation of certain historical events in some Western countries?". The historical truth is considered by the Russia's citizens as a universal interpretation of historical events, so the majority (48%) claims it is necessary to protect historical memory by the preservation of those interpretations of the historical events, that are admitted by the society. Supporting the idea that historical truth should be protected, Russian citizens rather support harsh political statements and defensive foreign policy discourse than demonstrate real involvement into historical context, their own daily interest in protecting accepted interpretations of the past and personal concern about their correctness. In 2022 less than a third of the respondents (29%) considered the ordinary citizens should protect the historical truth, while the majority claimed the state's leadership (67%), professional historians (49%) and social scientists (38%) should defend national historical memory.

DE Collectio Thessalonicensis; Emperor Honorius; Emperor Theodosius II;
   Eastern Illyricum; Thessalonica; imperial correspondence; Patriarchate
   of Constantinople; Bishop of Rome
AB Introduction. The Collectio Thessalonicensis is a collection of documents compiled in the 9 th century, in which, in addition to papal letters to the bishops of Illyricum and to the Patriarchs of Constantinople, Proclus and Anatolius, two lengthy fragments have been preserved, representing a letter from the Western Emperor Honorius (395- 423) to the Eastern Emperor Theodosius II(408-450) and the latter's response. The correspondence apparently took place in 422 and is devoted to the privileges of the Roman see in Eastern Illyricum, which shortly before had become a prefecture of the Eastern Roman Empire with its capital at Thessalonica. The authenticity of these letters has long been rejected in the scholarly literature. As a consequence, the task of the article is to present the arguments of the old literature, provide new evidence of the authenticity of both fragments, and highlight the ecclesiastical-political and ecclesiastical-administrative situation that they reflect. Analysis. The arguments of J. Friedrich, Th. Mommsen, and E. Chrysos in favour of the forgery of these fragments are considered. These arguments range from complete denial to partial acceptance of their authenticity, with speculation about the motives for the falsification and the timing of its implementation. The author of the article points out the inconsistency of these arguments. The newest casual arguments of P. Riedlberger, which deny their authenticity, are also refuted. Based on ascertaining the authenticity of these documents, the author reconstructs the circumstances of the correspondence between the two emperors and the motives of both correspondents in recognising the authority of the Roman see in Eastern Illyricum. The text of the messages and their connections with other similar imperial documents are analysed, and the factor of influence on their composition of the ecclesiastical circles of the West and the East is determined. Results. Contrary to the old literature, the authenticity of fragments of correspondence between Honorius and Theodosius II on the issue of church and administrative affiliation of Eastern Illyricum has been put beyond doubt. The letters fit well into the context of other surviving imperial documents that did not have a legislative nature but related to issues of church policy and church governance. From them it is clear that church and administrative issues were entirely under the jurisdiction of the emperors: neither the Pope nor the Patriarch of Constantinople had the means to obtain jurisdiction in a particular region, bypassing the opinion of the emperors.

AB The article is devoted to the conflict situation that unfolded in 1943-1944 and related to the election of the head of the Department of Theoretical Physics, Faculty of Physics, Moscow State University. The parties to the conflict were professors from Moscow State University and a group of academicians of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. The confrontation between two groups of physicists generated a large number of texts in the form of appeals from the parties to the authorities and responses to these appeals. The study introduces into scientific circulation and analyzes in detail letters from six representatives of MSU, stored in the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History, addressed to the party leadership, as well as two notes representing the government's response to the conflict. The value of the analyzed texts and the conflict itself is determined by the fact that they highlighted not only personnel and personal, but also deeper problems of scientific life. These include: the problem of finding an optimal model for the organization of science in the USSR, the problem of the relationship between national and world science, the problem of monopoly and competition in science, the problem of the emergence and functioning of scientific schools and directions, the problem of autonomy of higher education in Soviet times, the problem of scientific ethics, interpersonal relations in an academic environment. In addition, the question of the influence of the conflict on the further transformation of the scientific and educational model of the USSR is raised. The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the listed problems, although tied to specifically historical material, are timeless in nature, and therefore very topical for the 21st century.

DE higher education institutions; university; professor; research

AB The specificity of the Soviet scientific and educational model was that higher educational institutions were primarily assigned the role of generating personnel, and conducting scientific research was understood as a low priority. At the same time, assistants, associate professors, and professors were systematically required to demonstrate scientific achievements. This attitude took shape in the mid 1930s and will remain unchanged throughout the Soviet period. The article, based on both regulatory documentation and materials extracted from archives (State Archive of the Russian Federation, Russian State Archive of Contemporary History, Russian State Archive of Social and Political History), characterizes the conditions for scientific activity of university teaching staff in Soviet times, from the point of view of incentives and barriers to doing science at a university. The author provides assessments of representatives of the party, Soviet governing bodies and the university community about the organization of scientific work, about the level of involvement of professors and lecturers in it. The article shows the wave-like transformation of approaches to university science: from a significant reduction in the first post-revolutionary decades, through the totality of attitudes towards mandatory scientific activity that characterized the 1930s-1940s, to a more flexible, balanced approach, starting from the 1950s-1960s. The author's interpretation of the existing university model and its connection with the modern Russian university is proposed. It has been established that approaches and mechanisms for optimizing scientific activity at a university, developed since the late 1950s (elements of individualization, the practice of reducing the teaching load of teachers actively working in science) are consonant with the ideas of the 21st century.

AB For over 20 years, there has been an ongoing debate about what is primary in the process of securitization-discourses or practices. Traditional research on securitization tends to analyze discourses and practices separately, which can be seen even in studies that attempt to combine these two approaches. In this context, the concept "discourses" refers to a wide range of public political statements, while the concept "practices" mainly refers to the strategies of security professionals. I argue that, in order to gain a better understanding of securitization processes, the research focus should be narrowed to first-order securitizing performatives and the related securitizing practices. This approach will highlight political statements that can genuinely alter social reality, bridge the gap between discourses and practices, facilitate the analysis of institutional mechanisms of securitization, and help obtain much new relevant empirical material. The potential benefits of the proposed approach are illustrated through the analysis of two cases: the Italian case and the Russian case. For the Italian case, the analysis includes declarations of states of emergency related to the exacerbation of the "nomad issue." For the Russian case, it examines legal acts stipulating the official recognition of migrants as prone to terrorism.

AB Danish foreign policy activism in the Global South is the subject of many contemporary academic inquiries. However, the postcolonial approach is scarcely used to analyse Danish foreign policy. The heterogeneous character of Danish colonialism has also been overlooked by scholars: while Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands are thoroughly examined in Danish postcolonial studies, so-called "tropical colonies" (the Danish West Indies, the Danish Gold Coast and Danish India) are almost "forgotten". The object of the study is Ghana, which is traditionally perceived only as a former British colony but is one of Denmark's longest standing and stable partners in Africa. Attention should be also paid to the paradigm shift in Danish-Ghanaian relations, summarised by the slogans "Fra bistand til handel" ("From aid to trade") and "Fra bistand til business" ("From aid to business"), referring to the WTO initiative "Aid for Trade". The aim of this article is to identify how Denmark discursively justified the rethinking of bilateral relations with Ghana according to the "Fra bistand til handel" concept. To achieve our aim, an in-depth qualitative content and discourse analysis of the text corpus is used, which is followed by commentary from the point of view of postcolonial theory and discourse theory. It is concluded that the construction of foreign policy activism discourse is inextricably linked with Denmark's construction of its postcolonial "Self" identity. The discourse is intended to resolve the social antagonism between the desired identity of a "moral force" and "good Samaritan" for the Global South states with the identity of "just another" former European coloniser. The colonial past is split into elements in the discourse of postcolonial activism: the "bright" elements (common cultural and historical heritage) are proclaimed as the basis for building a common glorious future, while the "dark" elements (slave trade, power inequality, economic backwardness) are attributed to the exceptional "Other", which is Ghana in our case. Aid and development are used as the main tools of atonement for colonialism. By splitting its colonial experience into pieces, the Danish "Self" liberates itself from the nightmares of the past, whereas the burden of dealing with them is laid on "Exceptional Others", including it West African partner.

AB This paper presents a scientometric analysis of publications on active aging / longevity, delayed aging, health of the elderly, etc. The purpose of this work is to update research methods for studying the multifactorial and nonlinear nature of aging and to identify the relationship between the topics of academic publications and those announced in the official agenda of the Madrid International Plan for Active Aging and the Active Aging Index. The adoption of the concept of active aging through the Madrid International Plan and subsequent national active aging / longevity plans in a number of countries has provided an important normative reference point for later life. This was not only a political and neo-liberal action for longer employment of the elderly, but also had an important impact on changing the macro- and micro- social climate of aging, and elderly's understanding of the life strategy, age, and themselves. In 2016, Russia adopted the 'Strategy of Action for the Interests of Senior Citizens in the Russian Federation until 2025' and later the Active Longevity Index. (ALI). This paper analyzes the scientific publications on the topics of active / delayed aging and late adulthood in relation to ALI parameters. The results of the thematic mapping of academic publications from the Scopus and eLibrary databases characterizing the topic of aging for the period 2012- 2022 are presented. Existing publications cover domestic and foreign experience in research on aging and the elderly. The study shows that the field is dominated by topics related to the development of indicators for active aging, productive aging, human capital, and health care or the use of health services assessment. The paper notes a trend towards medicalization in the study of aging issues and a focus on methods for analyzing large amounts of data.

DT Article
DE Japan; Indonesia; Netherlands; Indonesia-Japan relations;
   Japan-Netherlands relations
AB In this article, the author analyzes the post-war development of relations between Japan and Asian countries. This work tracks correlation between sustainable development of economic and political relations, on one hand, and gradual decrease of tension connected with the issues of historical past in the second part of the 20th century, on the other hand. The article addresses the issue of post-war relations between Japan and other Asian countries (PRC, Korea, Taiwan), as well as Southeast Asian countries (mainly Singapore, Indonesia). Besides, special attention is paid to the issues of historical memory related to the Japanese occupation of Indonesia and its consequences, specifically to the problem of the historical grievances of Dutch people towards Japan and the problem of children born to men from the Japanese military and local women. In the 1980s, the mothers of these children and the children themselves started visiting Japan. The visits were financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan and included official meetings. At approximately the same time, the first trips for former Dutch POWs and those who had been forcibly conscripted to work in Japan were held. In the memorial places these people visited, memorial signs and steles were installed, which symbolized reconciliation on issues of historical memory. Traumatic experience produced by certain historical events is not the only issue here. Development of international ties after these events is also an important factor. The possibility of reconciliation or even overcoming such problems often depends on how positively and mutually beneficially such relations develop afterwards. Over time, especially as generations change and emotions connected with these traumatic events calm down, we can see preconditions for compromises and reconciliation. On the other hand, as tension between nations increases, the number of mutual claims is also increasing. If relations develop smoothly, especially if this process goes on for several generations, any offence or claim might be left behind and memory of it might even become a source of reconciliation.

DT Article

AB The Cold War was replaced by a post-bipolar world, which is morphing into polycentricity (multipolarity). In spite of the uncertainty regarding its final parameters and structural pillars, it is possible to assert that the current stage of international relations has two main features: selective deglobalisation and a new round of competition between major powers. Centrifugal forces in the 21st century have proved themselves stronger than the necessity of consolidation in the face ofuniversal challenges: international terrorism, climate change, pandemics, etc. Apart from economic and political contradictions, opposite interpretations of national security interests, the sphere of competition of values has emerged and is going through a restructuring process. The task of this research is to determine if value narratives and accompanying ideologies are reasons or consequences of the escalation of tensions in the "Russia - USA - EU" triangle. The author compares the role of value antagonisms today with the period of the Soviet-American clash of capitalism and socialism paradigms. The research shows that the resumption of geopolitical competition results not from the incompatibility of certain socio-economic models, but from a struggle for leadership in the system ofglobal governance and regulation. In the course of this struggle, the value discourse, which in general has an objective foundation, is exposed with time to profound securitisation and geopolitisation, leading to the construction of antagonisms: "democracies - autocracies" and "pseudo-values - traditional values". It is noted that the hypertrophied usage of the values' differences, with all their objectivity, can evolve from the function of cultural interaction to a self-perpetuating factor of interstate contradictions, which hinders adequate assessment of national and foreign resources and potential.

AB The current cycle of interstate rivalry and crisis of European security raises the issues of civilizational identity of Russia and relations between the West and East of Europe. The analysis examines a broad range of political, historical and cultural problems that determine the modern place and role of Russia in Europe. The current features of interstate rivalry and its structure are revealed. An analysis of the causes and historical parallels of recent events, including those related to the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis, is given. The strategic risks and opportunities of Russian foreign policy in Europe are outlined. It is underlined that the increasing aggressiveness of Western policy is dictated by the crisis of the neoliberal model of globalization. The European space of the EU and NATO increasingly finds itself in a situation where its ability to play a dominant role in the world is decreasing and it becomes necessary to adapt to the conditions of a polycentric world order. The inability of the West to keep pace with event produces the search for an external enemy, and the growing mentality of a besieged fortress. The West increasingly imports external risks by pedalling the Ukrainian crisis as well as the dogmatic course towards expanding the EU and NATO at the expense of Ukraine and other post-Soviet countries. In the current circumstances, while making much-needed efforts to preserve and strengthen Russian identity, it is important not to leave the concept of Europe at the mercy of those who do not understand Russia or are hostile to it.

DT Article
DE de se attitudes; first-person perspective; introspection; epistemology;
   justification
AB The article deals with the epistemological interpretation of de se attitudes proposed by Igor Douven. He suggests this interpretation as a skeptical solution to the problem of the difference between de se and de re attitudes. Classical solutions to this problem are based on the revision of fundamental concepts such as the concept of belief and the concept of proposition. Douven's skepticism is less radical and does not need this revision. The first part of the article focuses on explicating Douven's position. He accounts for the de re/de se distinction by pointing out the difference between the types of justification used for such beliefs. Introspection is enough for an individual to be justified in believing a proposition de se, while consulting external sources is necessary for him to be justified in believing a proposition de re. The second part of the article presents our objections to Douven's epistemological interpretation. We start by pointing out some terminological difficulties, mainly with the concept of introspection, due to the lack of its explicit definition. Then, we construct several examples in order to demonstrate that introspection is not sufficient to justify beliefs when an individual self-ascribes a property. Put differently, if one understands de se attitudes as a self-ascription of a property, Douven's account faces an inevitable issue. After that, we argue that even if one understands de se attitudes as a self-ascription based on the first-person awareness of having some property, we still can find examples when introspection is not enough to justify such ascriptions. In the third part of the article, we propose a slight modification of the epistemological interpretation by appealing to epistemic contextualism, i.e., we argue for the context-dependent nature of the justification procedures. The modified interpretation does not need to revise the basic structure of de se attitudes and allows us to reserve the crucial role of introspection as a way to justify such beliefs. When introspection is not sufficient, the justification of de se beliefs comes from context parameters.

AB In modern acad emic research, the concept of "competition" is quite rightly considered interdisciplinary. A constant object of intense discussion is the question of the peculiarities of the value perception of competition, as a result the normative element often becomes an integral part of even strictly scientific definitions. Any definition of competition largely depends on various subjective assessments of its ethical properties, first of all, on whether it is considered useful or, conversely, harmful. Most experts usually have no doubt about the fact that many modern ideas of competition as a socio-political phenomenon go back to the early stages of the formation of ancient social thought. The political philosophy of Hobbes and Kant represents an important "connecting link" providing clear fixation by specialists of the line of continuity of debates about the nature of competition between classical antiquity and modern theoretical discussions. Already in the early period of his work, Hobbes developed two main models of the state of nature, based on ideas of competition and difference, as well as a third emerging model of "linguistic chaos". The hypothesis of J. Hamilton is worthy of attention, according to which the basis of Hobbes's philosophical argumentation associated with the development of theories of the state of nature and the state is a complex of ideas, which he defines as "adversarial thinking". The next stage in the development of the idea of competition, radical in its significance and theoretical consequences, is certainly associated with the moral and political philosophy of Immanuel Kant, who initiated the discussion about the international order that has been going on for several centuries. Kant's philosophy clearly reflected new ideas about the role of competition, closely related to the industrial revolution in England and the gradual spread of the idea of social progress.

AB Introduction. The article presents an attempt to identify the origins as well as the immediate causes of the diversity of interpretations of the concept of "competition" in modern political theory through a comparative analysis of the results of discussions of foreign scientists adhering to utterly diversified methodological, philosophical, and ideological positions. Methods and materials. The analysis of these discussions is carried out from an interdisciplinary perspective, combining the methodologies of modern political theory, political economy, political ethics and psychology, the methodology of history, the theory of international relations, and other scientific areas. More than 60 works by prominent foreign experts, published mostly in the last decade, were used as source materials for the study. Many of them are openly polemical and controversial. Analysis. A noteworthy moment in theoretical debates at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries is the desire of many specialists to distance themselves from traditional neoliberal rhetoric and explore the latest trends and modifications of competition at the levels of world and national politics from fundamentally new methodological positions. The ideas of creating alternative theoretical models that ensure harmony between competition and cooperation and thereby help overcome almost half a century of dominance of the neoliberal world order paradigm have a wide resonance. Their immediate consequence is the emergence of new conceptual interpretations that characterize the specific features of the formation of the idea of the new international order, with corresponding changes in the field of political terminology. Results. The main section of the article presented an attempt to characterize the modern foreign policy turn towards "new strategic competition" and highlight, in particular, the emerging theoretical problem, which experts sometimes refer to as the "paradigm of armed interdependence." Amid discussions around the Ukrainian conflict in Western scientific literature, some interpretations of the problem of political and economic rivalry between the United States and China look paradoxical: they often reflect the clear desire of the American ruling elite to maneuver and, if possible, avoid the prospect of waging a war on two fronts. Authors'contribution. V.A. Gutorov analyzed the main directions of discussions related to the problem of conceptualizing the notion of "competition" in international political theory. A.A. Shirinyants carried out a direct analysis of the theoretical and ideological debates around the diverse problems of global and regional rivalry between the world powers.

AB The article aims to monitor the Israeli lobby actions in the US Congress on the issue of the supporting Israel during the operation << Peace to Galilee >> before the introduction of the Multinational Force in Lebanon (MNF). The main sources for this study were transcripts of the Senate and House of Representatives meetings and hearings in congressional committees (the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Finance). Other sources included the publications in American newspapers and economic statistics. The article begins with a definition of lobbying and its varieties. A brief background to the conflict between Israel, Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is also given. The main reasons for the IDF military operation were the desire to weaken the PLO in southern Lebanon and the Syrian forces in northern Lebanon, which provided support to the Palestinians through the deployment of Soviet air defense systems. The main part of the article is devoted to the discussion by congressmen of the need to support Israel in the Lebanese mission. Based on the analysis of the Congressional hearings, 7 arguments of different themes and persuasiveness were identified. The efforts of the Israeli lobby were aimed at preventing the cessation of political and military support for Israel in the context of a large-scale military operation. Special attention in the discussions of the Congress was paid to the role of the United States as a rival of the USSR in the region. The last part of the article briefly describes the results of lobbying for Israel's interests in Congress. Lobbyists managed not only to maintain US military support, but also to support the positions of President R. Reagan after his announcement of aid to Israel using Section 4.2 of the War Powers Act. US financial assistance to Israel increased in 1983, which again demonstrates the influence of the Israeli lobby on decisions made. The tense and substantive debate in Congress once again demonstrated the ability of the legislature to influence the decisions of the US president.

AB The article advocates updating the research concerning divided societies and complexly organized states. It addresses the genesis and advancement of complex identities of social actors and political agency. The discussion focuses on the correlation between the structuration and content saturation of identities. The use of operational interfaces from fundamental distinctions to various kinds of divides, demarcations and polarizations leaves still unresolved the problem of qualitative parameters of identities, and ways to represent and analyze them. Innovative approaches developed by Russian political scientists take into account the relationship between the processes of world development and the identity of its development drivers and agency from individual political actors to complex social movements. The article shows that the effective deployment of the respective research program requires not only external accounting of the temporal parameters, but full integration of modern evolutionary approaches into their methodology. It is necessary to overcome the usual interpretations of identity in the singular as an abstract universal idea. Equally it is necessary to move to the study of the complex interaction of the acting forces of development and the formation of a dynamic flow of individual and mutual identifications in the plural. To this end, it is suggested not only to update the Rokkanian paradigm of demarcations by expanding the set of distinctions and making the whole structure more dynamic, but also to use the possibilities of extended evolutionary synthesis.

AB This article addresses the misidentification of Colonel Pavel Rennenkampf, a member of the Southern Decembrist conspiracy and a colonel in the General Staff (1790-1857), by historians. Through the examination of investigative materials, police reports, official correspondence, and memoirs, the author aims to establish the documentary evidence supporting Pavel Rennenkampf's involvement in the Decembrist movement. It is concluded that this officer played a significant role in S. I. Muravyov-Apostol's plans for organizing the uprising of the Chernigov Regiment, dedicated to the secrecy of the military conspiracy and its political goals. The research novelty lies in shedding light on an understudied figure in Decembrist history, previously overlooked by historiography. The relevance of this study lies in its contribution to understanding key events in the Decembrist movement - the Southern conspiracy and uprising. The article discusses why the incriminating evidence indicating P. Ya. Rennenkampf's involvement in clandestine societies was disregarded during historical proceedings and remained largely unnoticed by historians. The author provides an explanation for the long-standing misattribution of K. P. Rennenkampf instead of P. Ya. Rennenkampf in historical accounts.

LA English
DT Article
DE new political cycle; social capitalism; oligarchic capitalism; new
   Social Contract; 2024 "May decree"
AB The new political cycle and Vladimir Putin's fifth presidential term are beginning in rather difficult and contradictory conditions for Russia. On the one hand, there are more and more signs that NATO countries are preparing for a direct military conflict with our country; this fact leads to an escalation of the already tense international situation. On the other hand, there are still no signs in the domestic political arena that the elites (primarily in the public administration system, representatives of big business) are beginning to feel the essence of the historical moment and, accordingly, shift their motivation and their values from personal interests to the interests of national security. The reason lies in the fact that although the President is adopting important decisions necessary for the start of a new political cycle (formulation of national development goals until 2030, 2036, appointment of responsible executors for their implementation), he has not given an answer to the question of what kind of State we are building. The State of "social capitalism" or "crony capitalism"? The need for an answer to this question (and specifically from the President) has been maturing in society for many years and has now reached such a degree of relevance that it became the subject of a plenary discussion with the participation of the head of state at the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum, held in Russia on June 5-8, 2024. However, at the Forum, there was still no response from the President to this question; so many experts (mostly reflecting the opinion of the majority of the country's population) remain in a state of anxious expectation about where Russia is going; whether the country has a clear understanding of the image of the future, which is necessary for the successful achievement of all the goals of the special military operation and for building the contours of a new Social Contract that should replace what can be called the paradigm of semi-colonial dependence on the West... The article uses an extensive database in the form of expert opinions, facts, and monitoring sociological surveys results. Scientific novelty of the approach consists, first of all, in a combination of various aspects of the social and political life of the country, which become the subject of our analysis. Among them are specific administrative decisions of the head of state, assessments of public opinion, views of representatives of big business, opinions of State Duma deputies, political and public figures, historians, economists, etc. In particular, the article presents the results of the vote in the lower house of Parliament on the approval of candidates for new members of the Government of the Russian Federation, as well as data from the open accounts of a number of large metallurgical corporations, indicating that the priorities of their activities do not correspond to the challenges that Russia has faced after the beginning of the special military operation.

   Russian Federation; national development goals; civilizational crisis;
   sovereignty; national identity
AB March 15-17, 2024, the presidential election will be held in Russia. The election will take place in a very specific context due to the ongoing special military operation, aggravating threats to national security posed by NATO countries, and a range of internal changes that Russia has been going through since the beginning of the special military operation. Against the background of the alarming situation around Russia, the RF President delivered his annual Address to the RF Federal Assembly on February 29, 2024; he presented a program of actions and specific public policy measures for the next six years (until 2030). The Address had certain aspects reminding of an election speech and was intended not only for government bodies at all levels of public authority, but also the broad strata of Russian society. In fact, the head of state outlined the contours of Russia's future for the next political cycle, and this is important amid uncertainty and a high level of risks that the country is facing at the present historical moment (after the start of the SMO). The article presents our own approach to analyzing the current situation in the country (including the 2024 presidential election), based on our long-term monitoring of public administration effectiveness, the system-wide nature of which is determined by the comprehensiveness of the empirical base (analysis of national and regional statistics, including those of own compilation; sociological surveys, analysis of expert assessments and key decisions taken by the President and the RF Federal Assembly). Scientific novelty of the study lies in a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of public administration during Vladimir Putin's first four presidential terms (2000-2024), that is, during the first quarter of the 21st century. In this context, we analyze general goals, objectives, and principles of public administration formulated by Vladimir Putin as he assumed office as president for the first time; key initiatives and decisions he adopted in order to address the tasks set; internal and external conditions in which the head of state had to achieve national development goals; key stages that the country went through over the past 23 years; and the main results with which it "approached" the beginning of a new political cycle.

DT Article
DE RF presidential election; national development course; elites; RF
   Government; Time of heroes".
AB According to the results of the presidential election held in Russia on March 17, 2024, more than 76 million people voted for the current head of state Vladimir Putin (87% of those who took part in the vote); this is almost twofold greater than in his first presidential election (on March 26, 2000, 40 million, or 53% of the voters who participated in the election, voted for Vladimir Putin). The article analyzes reasons for such a solid "mandate of trust" that the President obtained; they include not only the support of the majority of Russians for the general course of national development implemented by Vladimir Putin, but also the specifics of the historical period during which the 2024 presidential election was held, as well as the results of voting on the territory of the new RF constituent entities that joined Russia after the 2014 coup in Ukraine. In the context of the ongoing special military operation and lingering threats to national security, the internal situation in Russia, which determines popular support for the President, is of particular importance. In this regard, we draw attention to the importance of effective (full-fledged and timely) implementation of the election promises of the head of state, which Vladimir Putin announced in his Address to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation on February 29, 2024. The fulfillment of the tasks set by the President for the period up to 2030 largely depends on the elites in the system of public administration; therefore, at the beginning of a new political cycle and Vladimir Putin's fifth presidential term (2024-2030) a lot will depend on the new Government of the Russian Federation, whose composition will be announced in May 2024, after the presidential inauguration. With the help of expert assessments, statistical data and the results of sociological surveys we analyze reasons for the incomplete fulfillment of instructions and tasks that Vladimir Putin outlined in his previous election speeches, and in relation to the current situation we conclude that the key conditions for further implementation of the national development course are the achievement of all the goals of the special military operation and the continuation of the process of nationalization of the elites. The article presents calculations based on official data of the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation on the results of the presidential elections of 2024 and 2018 in all constituent entities and federal districts of the Russian Federation. We analyze the all-Russian dynamics of turnout and voting results in all presidential elections in Russia for the period from 2000 to 2024. We make an overview of expert assessments regarding the work of the RF Government headed by M.V. Mishustin. The facts showing the presence of acute unresolved problems in the system of public administration are collected and systematized in key areas of national development.

DT Article
DE generation; generational research; scientific dynasty; professional
   dynasty; status transmission; scientific everyday life; social capital;
   succession
AB The article discusses the problem of value orientations in scientific dynasties of Russia in the 20th century. An interdisciplinary historical, sociological and anthropological perspective focused on a socio- historical approach was applied to the study of intergenerational interaction. Evolved on the developed classification of transmission status models in professional dynasties, the authors sought to identify the features and patterns of the choice of certain types of succession by members of the dynasties during & acy; specified period. The following observations were made with the help of sociological data. Hence, according to the study, the reform spirit of the 1950s - 1960s corresponds to the model of active succession. The transition to a conservative model of political and economic development of the country in the Brezhnev period, and the evolution of the image of a scientist as a mass researcher lead to the spread of a passive model of professional inheritance. However, the internal patterns of mastering professional practices in academic families should be also accounted. Moreover, in the context of socio- political and economic transformations in Russia in the 1990s, subsequent generations "X" and "Y" demonstrate a full set of models for the professional status transmission, such as transprofessional mobility, active and passive models. Under conditions of "depressurization" of the scientific community, hybrid transmission models, characterized by a partial return to basic scientific values, enriched by the actualization of subjective life experience, turned out to be possible.

   "enlightened absolutism"; Catherine II's invasion of Crimea; history of

AB The article deals with a story first mentioned in historiography by Moisei Alperovich. On February 13 (2), 1787, the Polish Count Ignacy Potocki (1750-1809) at a dinner party in Kiev told a former colonel of the Spanish army, the Venezuelan Francisco de Miranda (1750-1816) that the best monument of Rome seemed to him the image of kings with their hands bound (Reyes ligados pr. las manos). This phrase reached Grigory Potemkin, King Stanislaus Augustus and his entourage and received a republican interpretation which fits well with the life story of the interlocutors: Ignacy Potocki would become a co-author of the Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791, in 1792 would serve as an acting War Minister, and during the Tadeusz Kosciuszko Uprising of 1794 would become the Minister of Foreign Affairs; from 1783 Francisco de Miranda was preparing a revolution in Spanish America, and in 1812 he would lead independent Venezuela. The article for the first time attributes the "kings bound" as statues of defeated barbarian rulers (from 1720 in the Palazzo dei Conservatori). From the mid-sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries these "kings bound" were exhibited on both sides of the female statue of Ceres remade as an image of victorious, triumphant Rome (Roma victrix, Roma triumphans) symbolizing the victory of the Eternal City. My hypothesis is that Ignacy Potocki implied a "double" meaning: both a political declaration of the radical Enlightenment and a hidden panegyric to Catherine II.

One approach reveals the intellectual efforts of the Vienna logicians to bring the order of thought in line with the social and political ,, Ordnung " in Austria in the 1930s. It also brings to light the clash between the "exact thinking" and M. Heidegger's ,, Das Nichts", ", as well as the "new order", whose adherents sought support not in logic, but in the collective unconscious. The other perspective allows one to highlight the problem of ethics and a system of values, as shaped and solved differently by the language of logic, and by the great Austrian writers of the time.

AB The article is devoted to unknown and little-known facts of the biography of A. I. Dubrovin, the founder and first head of the largest Black Hundred organization of the Russian Empire, the Union of the Russian People, and subsequentlythe creator and leader of the first political party in Russian history, named after its leader - the All-Russian Dubrovinsky Union of the Russian People. New information is being introduced into scientific circulation concerning the origin, birth, education and service of Dubrovin; Previously unknown facts from his medical practice and public activities, which he conducted before the beginning of his political career, are given. Attention is drawn to the inaccuracies and errors made by researchers of Dubrovin's biography, on the basis of archival documents and materials of the pre-revolutionary periodical press, clarifications are made to the ideas established in historical science about the leader of the black hundred. The article also collects and systematizes the testimonies of contemporaries about Dubrovin, which provide valuable material for understanding this ambiguous political figure. A number of characteristics given to the leader of the Union of the Russian People by his contemporaries (statesmen and politicians, publicists and journalists, cultural figures) are given in this publication forthe firsttime. It is noted that despite the contradictory reviews about Dubrovin and the presence of opposite assessments of the personal qualities and activities of the politician in them, there is also a common thing in them that allows them to form a complete image of the leader of the right-wing Russian monarchists. The new information provided in the article significantly enriches the previously existing ideas about Dubrovin, allows us to partially revise the stereotypes and ideas about this famous politician that have been established in historical science, and provides valuable material for further study of his biography.

AB This article examines the changing perceptions of the Time of Troubles in Russian political culture between the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The author draws on the methods of the Cambridge school of 'intellectual history', represented by the works of J. Pocock and Q. Skinner, which allow the historical materials involved to be considered within the framework of the approach of 'cultural glossaries' and rhetorical strategies. The study focuses on debates about the ideal form of government, including historical plots of the Time of Troubles, in Russian socio-political thought of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, including those based on historical plots of the Time of Troubles. The article demonstrates that the appeal to these plots was connected with the foreign and domestic political spheres relevant to the contemporaries, and with the attempt to change the form of government in Russia or the threat of its change from outside during the Napoleonic Wars in the early nineteenth century. The analysis shows that eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Russian authors reinterpreted the historical events and personalities of the Time of Troubles using the Aristotelian glossary of forms of government. The application of this glossary to the historical themes of the Time of Troubles in Russian social and political thought effectively 'reinvented' the history of the Time of Troubles. In this 'invention of the Time of Troubles', the themes of 'tyranny' and 'tyrannicide' and speculation about the most appropriate form of government for Russia emerged. It is concluded that the emergence of these rhetorical strategies in references to the Time of Troubles played the role of historical argument and evidence in favour of the Russian monarchy for eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century authors.

AB The article is devoted to the role of the regional press of the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in mobilizing the masses to defeat the enemy and gain the victory during the Great Patriotic War. A study of the historiography of the issue shows that, unlike the central press of the war years, which is fairly well studied, the transformation of the content of regional, especially district periodicals, is not yet represented in historical literature. The source base of the work was the documents of the State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF) and the State Archive of the Republic of Tatarstan (GART), many of which are first put into scientific circulation. On the basis of declassified documents, the author analyses the content of newspaper headlines, describes the tasks assigned to correspondents, outlines the mechanisms for organizing political control over the content and presentation of material in regional periodicals during the war. The article emphasizes that, despite the wartime difficulties associated with mobilizing many employees to the front and the lack of material resources, the TASSR authorities made every effort to maintain the number of newspapers published in the regions of the republic. Mostly they printed notes "on the topic of the day." AThe reports propagated the experience of the leading workers, talked about achievements and production successes. Negligent bosses were exposed in critical notes, deserters of the labor front were condemned, shortcomings and omissions in the work of collective farmers were revealed. Published materials were distinguished by information richness and targeting. An important function of the press was to inform the readers about the Sovinformburo reports. The editors of the regional publications were responsible for ensuring that residents of the TASSR receive "fresh" news and verified information. Letters from front-line soldiers that testified to the close communicative ties between the front-line soldiers and those remaining in the rear were published in a separate section. The "Letter of the Tatar people to the front-line-line soldiers- Tatars" published in March 1943 in the newspaper Pravda and then reprinted in the republican and many regional newspapers caused a great resonance, inspiring soldiers to new military exploits. A necessary component of political and ideological work with the population during the war years was the "increase of revolutionary vigilance" of citizens. Party-Soviet bodies with special care monitored the non-disclosure on the pages of newspapers of information containing military and state secrets, for which they sent relevant instructions to the district committees. Responsibility for complying with the requirements issued from above was carried by the editors and authorized personnel of Glavlit. If political distortions or factual errors were found, strict measures were applied: the material was removed from print, circulations were seized or reprinted. Censors who committed serious violations were severely punished.

AB The paper reviews the book "Calculation and Morality. The Costs of Slavery and the Price of Emancipation (XVIII-XIX centuries)" / "Calcul et morale. Cotilts de l'esclavage et valeur de l'& eacute;mancipation (XVIIIe-XIXe si & egrave;cle)" by Caroline OudinBastide and Philippe Steiner, published in Russian in 2024. The authors address the history of French debates on slavery. They examine attempts to assess the economic efficiency of slavery, as well as discussions about the need for and ways to free slaves and restructure the labor market and economy in French colonies. Given thatslavery has been a key economic pillar of Western European colonial empires for a long time, it's not surprising that this topic was among the most widely discussed issues when the discipline of political economy was emerging. Oudin-Bastide and Steiner examine the rhetoric and arguments used by both supporters and opponents of slavery in the XVIII-XIX centuries. They show how economic estimates and calculations gradually gained popularity among both sides as an important addition to traditional moral arguments. This shift was due to the secularization and rationalization of morality in Europe during the Enlightenment Age. Furthermore, political economists were inspired by the progress in natural sciences, which they saw as a model for their own field. In their effort to prove their point of view and refute the arguments of their opponents, participants in the debates on slavery contributed to the development of the conceptual framework and methodological tools for economic analysis. Based on a wide range of sources, the book by Oudin-Bastide and Steiner gives an interesting description of a significant episode in economic history and the history of economic thought. It also provides a comprehensive account of the factors that drive the development of social, economic, and political thought and the underlying logic behind it.

However, the changed demographic appearance of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, the problems of preserving the culture of the peoples of the North, internal contradictions in the social movement may in the future raise the question of the appropriateness of the chosen model. But its revision is impossible, since orientation to the culture of the peoples of the North is the foundation for the existence of autonomy.

AB The issue of ensuring technological development in Russia has intensified in socio-political and academic rhetoric. The emphasis has shifted from the issues of import substitution to ensuring the technological sovereignty. The goal of the paper is to analyze the "technological sovereignty" concept in normative and academic discourse. We conduct the content analysis of normative documents and academic publications, and employ the elements of the narrative approach to analyze the concept of technological sovereignty. Our particular focus is on the institutions and instruments designed to ensure technological sovereignty in the Russian Federation. Research findings show that ensuring technological sovereignty excludes following the autarchic way; the article outlines the perspectives for cooperation and collaboration in science and technology between Russia and friendly countries, in particular BRIGS members. We contribute to the existing literature by elaborating on the methodological aspects of narrative studies, as well as through enhancing the understanding of technological sovereignty as a social construct in normative and academic discourse.

DT Article
DE science; monopoly of truth; free society; precariat; epistemological
   anarchism
AB This article problematizes the state of the contemporary scientific community, which fluctuates between the desire for autonomy and creative freedom, on the one hand, and responsibility to social challenges, on the other. In this context, the social meaning of Paul Feyerabend's epistemological anarchism is reconstructed, revealing not only critical but also positive significance for contemporary science. Answering the two-sided question, "What kind of society does science need, and what kind of science does society need?", Feyerabend gives a disappointing diagnosis of both society and science. The political desire for ideological monism and totalitarianism is supported by science, which is sometimes a form of ideology - a militant rationalism that excludes alternative points of view - and in turn parasitizes society. This circle can only be broken in a regime of genuine pluralist democracy, which will lead to a change in the understanding of science and its role in society. The ability to "defamiliarize" (B. Brecht), to take the position of the "other", to refuse to gain intellectual power - these are the key characteristics of free reason, as Feyerabend understood it. If we try to reconstruct a social group that possesses such a mind, then in the social projection it will include marginal people, dilettantes, scientists whose activities diverge from the disciplinary paradigm and norms of the standard scientific ethos. A precarian is such a subject of science that breaks the monopoly on the truth and contributes to changing the understanding of science. The question is raised about the productivity and effectiveness of the scientific precariat in relation to the concept of science in a free society, as well as to the positioning of this phenomenon in the context of current discussions about expert knowledge, citizen science and pseudo-science.

AB Introduction. China started to develop military -to -military ties and defense -industrial cooperation with Latin America and Caribbean countries in the early 2000s as an element of its strategy of comprehensive cooperation with the region. Defense cooperation was mentioned in the Chinese documents and statements on the policy in the region from the early 2000s. However, China has always considered this defense cooperation to be just a secondary, subordinate element of its overall strategy in the region. Methods. The article is based on Chinese publications, statements, and documents concerning China's policies in defense cooperation with the region, as well as on Latin American and other Western publications on specific cooperation projects. The author compares the Chinese approach to defense cooperation with Latin America to similar Chinese cooperation policies in other regions, especially in Africa. Analysis. China views defense cooperation with Latin America as a subordinate element of its general strategy of economic and political presence in the region. Cultivating ties with the local military elites of Latin America is especially emphasized, and the exchange of military delegations started in the early 2000s. To boost defense cooperation, China is sometimes ready to provide significant military assistance to the region. China has established permanent mechanisms of defense dialogue with the regional countries in the form of regular forums and conferences. Other important venues of military cooperation include personnel training, joint exercises, and the region's visits by Chinese warships. China has managed to establish a presence on the arms market in Latin America in the 2000s but has failed to become a major weapons provider in the region. Currently, Chinese arms sales in Latin America are in decline. However, China has achieved major results in the development of dual -use technology cooperation with the LAC countries, especially in the fields of space and internal security. That may create preconditions for faster development of military and military technical cooperation between China and Latin America in the future. So far, the Chinese approach to defense cooperation in the region remains more cautious and gradual compared to cooperation with Africa. China is reluctant to challenge the US red lines here. That may change in the future as China -US relations continue to deteriorate. Authors contributions. Ekaterina Kosevich was responsible for researching and covering the development of political relations between China and Latin America. Vasily Kashin touched on cooperation in defense, the security industry, and dual -use technology.

   ideology; motives of the social scientist's activity
AB The relevance of the issues under consideration is determined by the recent fundamental social -political transformations associated with the exacerbation of a complex set of cultural, civilizational and, thus, intellectual contradictions between Russia and the West. These contradictions force both the Russian society and the Russian social science to reconsider the results of the last thirty years and to predict future scenarios, including intellectual ones. The article summarizes some results of the development of the Russian social science in the post -Soviet period and discusses (at least invites to a discussion) the possible contours of its further development according to the new logic of social processes. The article considers both the achievements of the Russian social -humanitarian thought in the post -Soviet period and its problems, primarily the loss of intellectual independence due to the uncritical borrowing and dogmatization of many Western intellectual models, some of which were created to understand a different social -cultural reality, and others were initially an intellectual weapon against the USSR (Russia). The author proposes the concept of "humanitarian import substitution" as a possible guideline for further development, which should be implemented on the principle of avoiding extremes: on the one hand, uncritical denial of the generally significant achievements of the Western social science and humanities; on the other hand, dogmatization of the ideas of Russian social scientists. The author considers as a resource for such "substitution" the largely untapped analytical and explanatory potential of the Russian literary tradition that can become a theoretical -methodological basis for many social and humanitarian models and concepts.

AB Mass cinema can act as a powerful tool for influencing public opinion by appealing to shared values and collective historical memory, while simultaneously constructing and guiding these elements in alignment with policy objectives. This article explores the thesis that national cinema, as an element of a common cultural code, plays a significant role in the formation and reinforcement of collective (socio-cultural) identity. Specifically, it examines the significance of Brussels' efforts to cultivate a robust film industry as part of the European Union's strategy for constructing a collective identity. The authors test the hypothesis that cinema serves as a medium for fostering a sense of belonging and emotional connection among EU citizens. To this end, the study aims to uncover the specific mechanisms by which common historical and social narratives are conveyed through European Union cinema. The research methodology is grounded in a structuralist perspective on cinema (P. Wallen, C. Metz). The article analyzes how the EU has intensified its institutional support and promotion of European cinema, particularly in response to the << crisis of ideas >> in Hollywood, which has left a void in the global film market. This analysis is contextualized within the broader socio-political landscape, including the rising popularity of mass cinema during the pandemic and the heightened urgency for strengthening EU collective identity amid the Ukrainian crisis and the initiation of a special military operation. The findings indicate that the EU is increasingly leveraging the film industry to disseminate narratives, ideas, and values critical for both situational objectives - such as consolidating public opinion on specific political issues (illustrated by the << militarization >> of the film market in response to the 2022 military operation) - and long-term goals of fortifying the EU's collective identity. However, the long-term efficacy of cinema in shaping public opinion is constrained by its susceptibility to rapid trend shifts driven by audience preferences.

AB In the conditions of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, into which different countries of the world are entering unevenly, the question of the future of the humanities has become particularly acute. Humanities in general is under close attention from public, political and scientific expert circles due to growing doubts about its appropriateness in the new technological era and the lack of demand for humanities specialists in a rapidly changing labor market. Indeed, the contribution of humanists to the understanding and development of modern societies is not only unobvious or intangible, but sometimes their effectiveness is extended over time, while the Russian Federation and other states are moving to the implementation of short-cycle scientific policies. For the Russian Federation, Adiscussions about the future of the humanities are associated with domestic and foreign policy contexts. On the one hand, in the humanities branch of knowledge itself there is a diversity of opinions, an increase in crisis sentiment, and places for applicants to humanities faculties are being reduced. On the other hand, the state's ambitious plans require maximum impact from science in conjunction with production. The article postulates that it is critically important for the humanities in the current conditions to ask difficult questions about themselves, to rethink their role and functions among other branches of knowledge. One of the solutions is the development of genuine, rather than declarative or ostentatious, interdisciplinary synthesis of methods from different sciences. New research methods need to be developed, including digital tools. It should be borne in mind that the future of the humanities is closely tied to changes in the higher education system itself and the emergence of the term "University 4.0". What will the new university model be? Where is the place for the humanities in it? How does technology influence creative processes? These and other questions must be answered by humanists, who play an important role in understanding and managing the changes associated with Industry 4.0 and are able to explain the ethical, social, economic and cultural consequences of technological progress. The Fourth Industrial Revolution leads to changes in people's lifestyles, the emergence of new forms and norms of communication, and interaction between people in the physical and digital worlds. Technological progress threatens to change a person's way of life beyond recognition, and in the very short term. Therefore, the question posed in the title of the article, "being human in a changing world," is a super task for the field of humanities.

AB The article reconstructs the collective professional and political portrait of law professors as a special corporation in classical Russian universities. This corporation is considered in the context of the most controversial, complex, but at the same time the most alternative period in the history of our country - during the revolutions, the Civil War and the early years of Soviet power. During this period, the most radical transformations took place in the Russian statehood and social structure, the paradigms of most political, social, interpersonal, cultural and other processes. The reaction to these changes, the feedback and the response of the law professors is very revealing. Jurisprudence is a special socio-humanitarian science, and the law faculties of classical Russian universities throughout the previous imperial period carried out a specific mission to train personnel, mainly for public service and the public sphere. Sustainable statehood, the inviolability of its legal foundations, and the priority of law have always been for lawyers a factor of the positive development of the state and society. The events of the 1910s - 1920s radically changed and turned the professional life and attitudes of university lawyers upside down. Through the analysis of the collective professional and political portrait of law professors in the Asian part of Russia, its changes during the Civil War and the first years of Soviet power, their political and legal views on the events, their participation in political and scientific-pedagogical activities, their contribution to the development of legal science and higher legal education in Asian Russia are analyzed.

ID ALLIANCE
AB The dynamic between Russia and the West, specifically the United States and the European Union, has seen significant changes in the past three decades, resulting in notable impacts on the international system. Russia's revisionist response to Western hegemony in key sectors involves leveraging friendly states like Iran to counterbalance Moscow's perceived threats. This essay examines Russia and Iran's security and military cooperation as a means of resisting the perceived threat of Western hegemony in vital regions for these two countries. By researching Russia and Iran's security and military relationships, the author examines Iran's engagement in Russia's revisionist policies regarding Western dominance, particularly the United States, in areas of mutual interest for Moscow and Tehran. The author employed an explanatory design, a post-positivism paradigm, and a deductive approach, followed by an archival study strategy, to investigate qualitative and secondary data related to security and military cooperation between Russia and Iran in the Middle East and Eastern Europe over a cross-sectional time frame. To analyze various parts of the research hypothesis, the author based his research on the premises of the structural realist theory of balance of threat. The research purpose was aligned with the statistical population-cases of cooperation in Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Syria, and Ukraine-which allows for purposive non-probability sampling and limits the sample size to two instances of cooperation in Syria and Ukraine. The evidence examined in the present research validated the influence of four key factors on Russia's response to perceived threats from Western hegemony in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, namely aggregate power, offensive power, proximate power, and offensive intentions, as outlined in Stephen Walt's balance of threat theory in 1987. This study confirmed the hypothesis that there is a relationship between Russia's threat perception toward the West and security relations and military cooperation between Russia and Iran by analyzing operationalized variables and comparing research findings with the propositions of the chosen theory. The relationship is becoming increasingly strong, according to the evidence as predicted by its theoretical basis. Finally, the author concludes that Iran offers Russia a viable prospect for security and military cooperation. This cooperation helps Russia oppose Western hegemony in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, fitting with Russia's revisionist position against Western domination. Russia and Iran have intensified their relations, notably in the sphere of security, as a result of common beliefs, a firm resolve to maintain supremacy, and a sense of isolation from the rest of the world.

   degeneration; ecological crisis; survival strategies; A. Smith; T.
   Malthus; Third International Forum "Demography and Global Challenges"
AB The article discusses the potential of demographic policy as one of the ways to solve the environmental problem. The author shows that today high-quality demography is the only real opportunity to reduce the pressure of humanity on the ecosphere. Other "survival strategies" are either not effective enough (environmentalism) or have not yet reached the level of practical application (trans- humanism, posthumanism, etc.). The author notes that in historical perspective, demography initially acted as an area in which the quality of individuals was of significant importance. Thus, Adam Smith already considered the share of able-bodied citizens in the total population to be the main factor in the "wealth" of the state, thus dividing people into categories with different qualitative characteristics. The ecological motive in the assessment of social dynamics goes back to the works of T.R. Malthus and his "law of population", according to which population growth is described by geometric progression, while the resources of the Earth increase in arithmetic progression. In the context of the aggravation of the ecological crisis, largely due to the overpopulation of the Earth, it seems reasonable to move from a quantitative demographic policy to qualitative demography. The difficulty of such a transition is due to the fact that this term was used by classical eugenics at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries as an incomplete synonym for describing its specific tasks (along with the terms "racial hygiene" and "human genetics"). Negative connotations coming from that time, as well as an excessive enthusiasm for political correctness, prevent free discussion of demographic issues.

DE G. Gould; philosophy of art; creativity; musical performance
AB Glenn Gould is an innovative musician who subjects his work to intellectual reflection. He realized both in life and in art fundamentally new meanings that he developed independently. His theoretical legacy is the sum total of art historical works on the interpretation of music. The article is a reconstruction of Gould's philosophy of art, carried out on the basis of their analysis. The foundation of Gould's philosophy and life is creativity. The main problem of research - freedom of creativity - is solved in line with personalism using the method developed in the philosophy of structuralism. Art is capable of exerting a moral influence on life without social guidance; elements of immorality in it arise due to external influence. Therefore, creativity should be free, including that of a performing musician, from that authorial dictate, which was formed as an imperative in the post-Bach era, when a division of labor arose between the composer and the performer. Each sign specifying the expressiveness of the performance, set by the author in the musical text, limits the freedom of the performer. The method of release is to "simplify" the text by removing all author's indications from it, except for metro-rhythmic and pitch-tone ones, leaving the question of expressive means to the performer to decide. Justification for intervention in the author's text: the basis of the work, its structure, is not created by the composer, because any work is only a variant of another work, more precisely, a variant of the implementation of a similar structure. Therefore, the author's originality in art in the absolute sense of the word is not possible. On this basis, Gould suggests that the performer of music treat the pitch and rhythmic component of the text as a structure and continue the creative process of creating new concepts of the work. The performer becomes a musician in the broad sense of the word, as it was in the Baroque era. In modern "electronic culture" creativity does not end with the performance of the work, because it allows you to continue working with the audio file. The optimum of his existence is "anonymity", which helps to free the artist from public control and personal egoism associated with achieving success in life. The desire for it is immoral, because it provokes the artist to unworthy acts not only in relation to colleagues, but also in relation to his work, and the artist is responsible to him.

TI DIVIDING LINES IN THE EU'S COMMON FOREIGN POLICY: RUSSIA AS A POLARISING
   FACTOR

DE Russia; European Union; Europe; elites; dividing lines; fragmentation;

ID FRAGMENTATION; GOVERNANCE; CONSENSUS
AB Amid the ongoing confrontation between Russia and the West, the processes of consolida- tion and divergence among political elites are crucial for understanding the mechanisms that form dividing lines. This is particularly important when examining the elites of the European Union in their opposition to Russia. This article aims to develop a framework for analysing the dividing lines among EU elites in the context of relations with Russia. The analysis employs a multi-tier model establishinga relationship between the 'depth'of a dividing line and the degree of elite disunity. The model includes two levels of analysis of dividing lines within the EU: supranational and national. The research demonstrates that, depending on the degree of interest misalignment and the availability of communica- tion channels, elite divergence can result in segmentation, fragmentation or polarisation. Each of the tiers of divergence increasingly reduces the likelihood of forming a common EU position on foreign policy issues. All three tendencies - segmentation, fragmentation and polarisation - are observed within the EU in relation to Russia at different levels of elite analysis. Crucial to the formation of a dividing line is the aspect of EU-Russia relations in question: the degree of distancing from the country or support for, and fund- ing of, containment. Additional variables include factors such as the regional affiliation of the elite, their ideology and position within the power structure. Among all levels of analysis, polarisation is most evident in the efforts of supranational elites to promote 'militant integration', which conflicts with the interests of national elites and citizens of member states.

AB The article analyzes social dysfunctions and risks in the educational ecosystem combining formal and non-formal education. The educational environment is expanding mainly due to non-formal education, since its short-term courses and trainings make it possible to acquire in-demand skills in the digital economy and meet the labor market needs. Social, economic, and personal problems are solved, and social integration is supported through non-formal education. The rapid expansion of the educational landscape has provoked the emergence of destructive practices and dysfunctions in the learning process. Risks emerge that give rise to serious concerns among scientific and pedagogical communities. The aim of the article is to identify and classify the risks of the educational ecosystem appearing in non-formal education, based on the experts' opinion on this issue. The research methodology is based on theoretical and empirical parts. The article presents a theoretical analysis of scientific literature and an interpretation of dysfunctions and risks categories in education. The empirical part includes the expert survey method in the form of a semi-formalized interview.

SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Peter I; Feofan Prokopovich; natural law; common good; history of
   concepts
AB This article examines The Justice of the Monarch's Will (1722) by Feofan Prokopovich (1681-1736) as a political work of a transitional period. It combines innovative reasoning about monarchy based on natural law with arguments about God-given authority based on references to the Bible and theological texts. This makes it a political work of great significance for understanding the evolution of Russian political culture in the early eighteenth century. In accordance with the findings of S. V. Polskoi and E. Sashalmi, the pivotal ideological source of The Justice was the handwritten translation of the work of the German lawyer G. S. Treuer (1683-1743), Untersuchung nach dem Recht der Natur ( An Inquiry according to Law of Nature), published in 1718, and this rationalistic argumentation was predominant in Feofan Prokopovich's treatise. It is demonstrated that the manuscript of the translation was received by the Academy of Sciences only in 1742, and there is no evidence to support the assertion that it belonged to the library of Peter the Great. A comparative analysis of An Inquiry and The Justice shows that Treuer and Feofan Prokopovich had serious conceptual differences. According to Treuer, the emergence of absolute monarchy was associated with the low qualities of the subjects or their degradation, in connection with which the people ceased to be as an actor for him. In the view of Feofan Prokopovich, the advent of absolute monarchy was the result of a contract between the monarch and the people, who were motivated by self-interest and retained their agency even after the agreement. Nevertheless, it became evident that this subjectivity was constrained by the will of God, which was perceived as the authority of the monarch. In this section, the perspective of The Justice aligns closely with that of Ivan IV the Terrible, rather than with the ideas of European lawyers. This resulted in the establishment of a super- absolutist monarchy, in which theology held a primary position. It is probable that, because of this, the argumentation of The Justice did not undergo further development in postPetrine Russia, where secular argumentation was given precedence.

AB The article examines trade policy initiatives of the Biden administration. In a complex climate of domestic political polarization, the United States compete with China and defends its position in international markets. These challenges affect the areas of high technologies, digital economy, information and communications sector, renewable energy sources, and infrastructure. At the same time, an equally important problem in the context of increased geopolitical risks remains increasing the reliability of logistics and production chains, primarily for microelectronics. Addressing these challenges requires the creation of appropriate platforms that allow the United States to interact with partner countries. Within these frameworks, the United States intends to promote the priorities of the Biden administration: standards in the field of high technologies, ensuring the energy transition, protecting working conditions and inclusion. Another crucial area is promoting the fight against corruption, ensuring transparency of business processes in partner countries and training personnel. Completing these goals should attract American business and investment to the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions and Latin America. These should also increase American leverage in its strategic competition with China. At the same time, the formats of cooperation created by the United States must be insured against their internal political situation and the risks of interruption of work when there is a change of presidential administrations. In less than four years of its work (2021-2024), the Biden administration has proposed three platforms: the Global Infrastructure and Investment Partnership, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, and the Partnership of the Americas for Economic Prosperity. The results of their implementation are different. This article examines the two last mentioned regional platforms and describes conditions for their creation, work prospects, probable risks, and some results.

AB Introduction. The scientific relevance of the topic is due to the fact that the concepts of colonialism and neocolonialism are currently becoming part of the official Russian political discourse. The article examines how film representations of the struggle against American neocolonialism in Latin America are used to create the image of the American enemy in the context of the Cold War, which determines the novelty of this work. Methods and materials. The article is based on Soviet features and documentary films about Latin America. Analysis and results. The author comes to the following conclusions: images of neocolonial exploitation of Latin America contributed to the creation of the image of the American enemy, endowing it with such features as immorality, greed, cruelty, and contempt for the population of the Third World. In addition, the images of Latin America and the struggle of its population against neocolonialism were used in the politics of Soviet identity. A demonstration of solidarity with the people of Latin America maintained the image of the USSR as the leader of the liberation struggle against (neo)colonialism. The struggle against pro -American governments in Latin America acquired legitimacy through images of the plight of the countries ruled by powers accomplishing American neocolonialism. Films about the Cuban and Nicaraguan revolutions served to predict victory over neocolonialism in the region in particular and the American enemy in the Cold War in general.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the academic discussion that revolves around the problem of conceptualization of violent and non-violent protest. After the author briefly documents the main milestones in the study of protest movements, he focuses on the main one - the emergence of the concept of Erica Chenoweth and her database of Nonviolent and Violent Campaign Outcomes (NAVCO). On the basis of this concept and database, as well as their criticism, the author demonstrates the existing conceptual chaos in defining and disentangling violent/nonviolent and armed/unarmed protests. According to his initial hypothesis, such chaos largely stems from the inattention to the extent of violence and disregard for its relativity. However, after the author elaborates an alternative hypothesis taking into account these factors, and it appears incapable of answering several questions that arise when studying protest campaigns, he had to conclude that the origins of this situation are far deeper. Having examined in detail the set of problems faced by protest researchers, the author suggests that at least some of them will be solved by returning to the context, which in turn requires abandoning methodological homogenization and including qualitative methods in the research arsenal, along with quantitative ones. At the same time, according to his conclusion, the general conceptualization of violent/nonviolent, as well as armed/unarmed, protests is impossible and meaningless. It will always encounter limitations that Political Science cannot overcome.

The compilers were historians P. N. Bazanov and A.V. Repnikov, who prepared articles for publication and comments on them. The structure of the book consists of seven sections. The articles included in the anthology covered the difficult period of Russian history and the formation of Russian emigration in the 1920s. The time when hopes fora quick return to the homeland were perceived as reality, the time when programs for the political structure of Russia without the Bolsheviks appeared. The contents of the anthology reveal the ideological origins of the movement, the main views and show the perception of change of leadership in emigration and Soviet Russia. The compilers have done a tremendous amount of work in selecting relevant texts and identifying the original source of publication. The comments provide detailed biographical information about the authors of the articles and characters mentioned in the text, and provide a brief historical background about the events described in the article. P. N. Bazanov prepared a detailed introductory article about the history of the movement and the historiography of the issue. This attention to detail distinguishes the authors' work and demonstrates the high scientific level of the anthology under review. The selected material allows us to present the Smenovekh movement, their ideological views, perceptions in emigration and Soviet Russia. The publication of thematic collections of historical sources always contributes to the development of historical science, draws the attention of researchers to this topic, allows them to see new facts and draw informed conclusions.

AB 2024 Abstract. Introduction. The key issue of this work is the relationship between the press, public opinion, and political institutions of Great Britain during the Crimean War (1853-1856). In this context, the political activity of the Sheffield radical John Arthur Roebuck (1802-1879) is considered. The relevance of the work is determined by the research thesis that, during the Crimean War, public opinion was no longer only broadcast by the press but was largely shaped by it. Methods. The broad research context of the article is provided by a critical method of processing sources, some of which (publications from the provincial newspapers Sheffield and Rotterham Independent and Iris), discovered in the Northamptonshire Record Office, are being introduced into scientific circulation for the first time. Analysis. The goal of this article is to clarify the thesis well-established in traditional historiography, according to which the influence of the press on the current political agenda became significant only in the late 1860s. The analysis done in the article shows that if in the mid-30s of the 19th century the press only broadcast the opinion of the political elite, then during the Crimean War it already had the most direct influence on the formation of British public opinion. Results. The result of the study was the thesis that by the end of the Crimean War, the British press was quite able to influence public opinion and, even under certain circumstances, determine it. However, it still had very limited influence when it came to measures affecting the prerogative powers of Parliament and the Cabinet. Authors'contribution. V.V. Klochkov determined the basic concept of the article and the methodological foundations of the study, as well as identified unpublished sources from the regional archives of Great Britain. V.S. Nazarova prepared the introduction of the article, created its structural composition, and analyzed the historiography of the problem. I.M. Uznarodov conducted an analysis of the publications of periodicals and formulated the main results of the study.

TI THE DEATH OF EPICURUS AND HUME'S GUILLOTINE

DT Article
DE Epicurus; death; evil; time; Hume
AB The article analyzes the famous Epicurus' thesis on death. According to his views, we should not fear death because it does not affect us either during our life or after our death. The research aims to analyze the existing criticism of Epicurus' thesis and formulate a new one. The article considers the embeddedness of Epicurus' thesis in the overall ethical system he was developing. Epicureanism as an ethical thought considers ataraxia - serenity, the avoidance of suffering - in the purpose of our lives. In this sense, minimizing the fear of death allows us not to experience suffering, and so to lead a more morally justified way of life. In a similar way, Epicurus' thesis about death is coupled with his metaphysical views about atoms and their role in our perception. According to these views, sensation in the phenomenological sense is available only to the combination of atoms of body and soul. (It should be noted that in this way Epicurus blocks the idea of rejecting the fear of death, based on the mystical notion of the posthumous existence of the soul. It follows that the concrete moment of death itself is not experienced.) Further discussion focuses on the debate about whether death is a state of affairs. The importance of such an interpretation rests on a fundamental argument against Epicurus' thesis, the deprivation argument. It is based on a very simple idea: death is evil not because it brings negative sensations with it, but because it deprives us of the possibility of feeling, of having new experiences. However, this argument faces certain logical and metaphysical problems within the framework of the argumentation used by Epicurus, namely, the so-called thesis of the temporal localization of harm. A much more original critique of Epicurus' ideas can be found in a recent paper by Mark Fisher. It proposes a mental experiment "Without Senses", according to which we have a person deprived of physical sensations, but at the same time preserving life in the biological sense. From the perspective of Epicurean theory, this example represents a paradox, while at the same time our practical intuitions are on the side of Fisher's argument. To neutralize this argument, it is proposed to use Hume's famous principle. The main difficulty is that, similarly, this principle does not correspond to Epicurus' thesis in the question itself. A more neutral formulation of Epicurus' thesis is proposed, which could satisfy Hume's principle, on the one hand, while gaining an advantage over Fisher's criticism, on the other.

AB War as a political and social phenomenon is one of the central subjects in political science and international studies. This is one issue where theory and practice are intertwined most closely and updated most frequently since each new military conflict discovers new facets of war and peace for researchers, military and policy-making circles. This theme nests a number of related disciplines and subtopics some of which have become especially relevant amidst growing interstate rivalry on a global scale and in certain regions of the world. What do "containment" and "escalation" mean today? To what extent is a state's foreign policy strategy determined by its "strategic culture"? How relevant are the ideas of the great military thinkers of the past to modern and future wars? At the center of all these stories is the issue of the evolution of means of armed struggle: how they are changing and what humanity can come to as a result of the "arrogance of force" of some states. To discuss these and other matters, Comparative Politics Russia sat down with Dr. Kokoshin, one of Russia's leading experts in the field of military-political, socio-economic and technological aspects of international and national security.

ID CITIES
AB The article examines two prevailing trends in human-centered research on smart cities, specifically focusing on the dichotomy between technocentrism and sociocentrism. Sociocentrism is conceptualized as a comprehensive framework that emphasizes citizen-oriented research ( referred to as "citizen-focused" smart cities) and citizen science, advocating for diverse methodologies to engage citizens in the participatory design processes of a smart sustainable city. This sociocentric perspective reveals a proclivity towards reinforcing the significance of critical urbanism, whose proponents argue it is crucial for detecting heightened inequality, social injustices, and equitable urban spatial arrangements. Contemporary critical urbanism and critical urban sociology share a common goal of unearthing the underlying implications of technology - specifically, its associations with disparities, hegemony, and injustices. The study delves into the historical, cultural, and political settings that have given rise to smart urbanism. Furthermore, it underscores the necessity of adopting a balanced strategy that integrates participatory elements alongside professional expertise in the execution of any smart city initiative. An integral theme within the discourse surrounding the reevaluation of smart cities pertains to the multifaceted concept of participation. Presently, the involvement of residents is deemed indispensable in not only the development of public spaces such as parks, waterfronts, and squares, but also in all smart projects. Various tools are employed to facilitate participation, ranging from surveys and social research to strategic project workshops, seminars, and community festivals. The mode of engagement is largely contingent on the project's scale and contextual backdrop. Within the realm of participatory endeavors linked to smart cities, the concept of a city assembly invariably assumes a central role. Several scholars posit that the theory of city assemblages enhances our comprehension of urban constructs and elucidates how contemporary discourses shape the realms of living, learning, recreation, employment, and interactivity.

AB The article reconstructs the period of the 1930s in the life and works of Karelian poet T. O. Guttari (literary pseudonym - Lea Helo). This study is based on a complex of sources, including periodicals, archival documents and scholarly literature. Unknown facts of biography and drafts of literary works are determined. New materials (letters, a diary and notes) are introduced into scientific circulation. The article also covers the focus of professional interests of the writter: translation of fictional texts, folklore studies, acquaintance with the famous narrators Maria Remshu and Larin Paraske, participation in conferences. In the first half of 1930s Guttari was effectively working on literary texts and translation of Soviet literature from Russian to Finnish. Special attention is paid to the crisis years (1936 - 1937), the period of productive work, rise and dramatic decline caused by social, political, psychological and material reasons. In 1936 creative rise was changed by severe disappointment in reality: a lot of people from the writer's closest acquaintances were repressed or arrested. National politics had also a destructive impact on Guttari's life. Loss of job, exclusion from the Writers' Union, threats and destructive criticism caused decline of creativity, almost total abandonment of writing and literary work. The issue of Guttari's exclusion from the Writers' Union and his rehabilitation is covered. T. O. Guttari's diary (September 3 - October 1, 1936), which is currently stored in the National Archive of the Republic of Karelia, is published in the appendix to the article.

AB The article is devoted to the consideration of the monographic research of I.V. Narskii, describing the con-tent of the book and its place in both Russian and foreign historiography. Suggestions are made regarding the possibilities for further use of the author's ideas. Published in 2001, Narskii's monograph garnered attention for its extensive use of sources from archives in Moscow and the Urals, as well as its innovative methodological framework. Narskii was among the first to employ the history of everyday life approach, which was primarily developed by German historians. Skillful application of this approach, accompanied by a switch in research perspective and a change in the scale of description, allowed the researcher to re-construct various aspects of the life and survival of "little people" in a "turning point in history," an era of enormous social catastrophe. Innovative in many respects, the monograph has had a significant impact not only on Russian, but also on foreign historiography. Now, in a different social and academic situation, the book remains relevant and stimulates new research. Other authors have used it as a reference for different historiographical directions, such as the history of emotions. Narskii's observations, conclusions and assumptions can also be applied to the study of the new political elites of revolutionary Russia, the tactics of individual and group survival during times of social catastrophe, and the history of political culture of the revolutionary era.

AB On the basis of diverse sources, the personal composition of Siberian merchants who found themselves in forced emigration in different parts of the world after the events of 1917 and the Civil War that followed them has been revealed and for the first time presented as fully as possible. Information about their life in the 1920s and 1930s has been analyzed. Special attention has been paid to outstanding representatives of the Siberian business world: I. V. Kulaev, M. A. Novomeisky, S. V. Vostrotin, as well as the most numerous community of Siberian merchants-emigrants formed on the territory of Northern Manchuria - primarily in Harbin. The spheres of their professional activity are considered, in particular, attempts to realize themselves in trade, industry, shipping. Information about commercial and industrial establishments owned by former Siberian merchants has been summarized. The article describes poor financial situation of many of them in the 1930s, difficulties that the younger generation of emigrants, whose parents were once related to the merchant environment of Siberia, had to face. Among the factors that negatively affected the lives of Siberian merchants who found themselves in a foreign land there were partial or complete loss of capital, an influx of refugees, uncertainty of legal status, difficult political situation, the economic crisis that broke out in the late 1920s - early 1930s. The conclusion has been made that in the current conditions, the most successful emigrants were old-timers and those who had previously been abroad - they knew foreign realities well, worked with local markets, owned money accounts and estate outside Russia, had acquaintances and specific plans for the development of their entrepreneurship.

AB The article is devoted to ideas about Lithuania, its territory, political history and ethnic composition of the population, formed in the Russian journalism of the 1860s, which went down in history as the Era of the Great reforms. On the one hand, the perception of ancient Lithuanians as barbarians and historical Lithuania as a wild land has become even stronger. For example, the histirian N. I. Kostomarov, exploring pagan mythology, characterized the civilization of Lithuania as "primitive" and "rustic". On the other hand, the Polish uprising of 1863-1864 forced Russian society to take a fresh look at the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. During this period, the idea of the history of the Lithuanian-Russian state as common past gained new relevance, and the images of Lithuania turned out to be closely connected with reflections on the ways of the future transformation of the Russian Empire. New approaches to the problems associated with the ethnocultural and religious diversity of the Western Regions and threats to the unity of the Empire were expressed in A. F. Hilferding's journalistic and scientific work.

AB Introduction. The article examines cooperation between Russia and the US on Arctic research in the context of the Ukrainian crisis. One of the accompanying tasks is to study the motivations of both sides for continuing such cooperation. Methods and materials. The article uses the so-called liberal intergovernmental approach as a research method, aiming to explain the reasons for cooperation between countries with different socio-political structures and national interests on the world stage. The empirical basis for the study was the documents of international organizations, US and Russian state institutions, as well as research organizations in Russia and the US involved in the study of the Arctic. Analysis. The article demonstrates that currently there are four main levels of US -Russian scientific cooperation in the Arctic: interpersonal (individual), institutional (between various Russian and American organizations), state (government exchange programs), and international (within the framework of multilateral organizations of a global and regional nature). Results. It is concluded that despite the unfriendly actions taken by the US against Russian scientists and organizations, the "mechanism of interdependence" created in previous years did not allow to completely interrupt scientific ties between these countries. Both sides are well aware of the value of cooperation in this area and therefore try to maintain certain channels of interaction. Natural science topics (climate change, meteorology, environmental protection, biodiversity conservation, oceanology, glaciology, etc.) dominate the priorities of US -Russian scientific cooperation in the Arctic. However, socio-humanitarian and interdisciplinary issues (local communities, indigenous peoples, gender studies, urban development and planning, etc.) have recently become increasingly important. The authors believe that scientific cooperation between Russia and the US in the Arctic will revive as the international situation and bilateral relations between the two countries normalize after the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict.

ID ISSUE DIMENSIONS; CLEAVAGES
AB The article is devoted to the place of conservative-traditionalist topics in the actual political agenda of Russia in the last decade. The research is based on the materials of the project Actual political agenda of Russia in inter-party debate, executed in the Institute of Scientific Information on Social Science of the Russian Academy of Sciences under the supervision of the author. It was established that conservative-traditionalist themes began to enter the country's current political agenda since the mid-2010s. Three of the 24 questions related to it belong to the foreign policy issue domain, the rest to the worldview one. 16 of the 24 questions meet the criteria of including in the current political agenda, that is, on the one hand, they generate polarization of positions, and on the other hand, they involve a fairly wide range of participants in the discussion. Factor analysis of party positions on conservative-traditionalist agenda issues revealed two dimensions: "modernists versus traditionalists" and "conservatives versus liberals". In the first one, liberals (Yabloko and New People) are opposed to everyone else; in the second one, the main opponents are Yabloko and Rodina. The comparison of these two dimensions with main political dimensions and subject sub-dimensions, identified in the framework of the Actual political agenda project, shows that the dimension "modernists-traditionalists" correlates most strongly with the sub-dimension "originalists-Westerners" in the worldview issue domain and the first main political dimension, which in turn also correlates most strongly with the same sub-dimension. The dimension "conservatives-liberals" correlates most strongly with the sub-dimension "hawks-doves" in the foreign policy issue domain. In general, the author's research gives grounds to assert that conservative-traditionalist topics, which, in particular, introduce into the agenda such concepts as sovereignty, great power and empire, play a leading role in the formation of the political space of present-day Russia, and over the past year it has reached its peak.

TI THE SOVIET PAST AS MYTH AND AGENDA
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
DE political myths; Soviet past; political agenda; factor analysis;
   election campaigns
AB The article attempts to look at the theme of the Soviet past through the lenses of the political myth making. According to the starting premise of the study, any ideology from the point of view of mass consciousness is first and foremost a set of myths. At the same time, the article assumes that myths are most effective when they remain implicit and impact mass consciousness by implication, rather than directly. When explicated, myths are subject to intensive criticism and become less persuasive for a significant part of the audience. The author states that during almost the whole post -Soviet period, the topic of the Soviet past was present in the inter -party discussion more in the background and therefore acted mainly like mythology. The discussion around it largely resulted in the confrontation between the communists and the rest of the political spectrum ("communists against everyone"). In 1993-2003, that confrontation had a significant impact on mass political consciousness and occupied at least second place in its importance. Since the 2010s, this confrontation has been replaced by another one e.g., "everyone against the liberals", which also manifested in the discussion on the issues of the Soviet past. Bearing the imprint of the imperial -patriotic mythology, the new confrontation was not clearly explicit, and at the level of the political agenda it was camouflaged by the theme of the Soviet past. The transformation of the latter from a "myth" into an "agenda" put Soviet mythology under the fire of criticism, diverting attention from the imperial -patriotic mythology.

ID PARTY COMPETITION
AB The article presents the results of testing the hypothesis, according to which ballot stuffing in favor of the "party in power", while causing minor distortions to the structure of electoral cleavages, does not fundamentally change it. The author tested the hypothesis on the data from the 2016 and 2021 elections to the State Duma of the Russian Federation held via proportional system rules. He used the following method: in the regions where ballot stuffing was allegedly used in favor of the United Russia party, a certain number of votes were subtracted from the United Russia electoral results in accordance with the difference between the maximum and effective ranges of the electoral cleavage related to the confrontation between of the United Russia and the rest of elections' participants. The author employed two models to run calculations: in the first model the threshold for deduction was a difference of 50% between the maximum and effective range, in the second model the difference was 5%. For 2016 elections, the first model took away more than 6.1 million votes from the United Russia, the second model subtracted more than 12.5 million votes; for 2021 elections - more than 5 and more than 10 million votes, respectively. Nevertheless, there was no radical change in the structure of electoral cleavages, let alone its elimination. The study showed that although ballot stuffing in favor of the "party in power" artificially overemphasizes the role of the authoritarian-democratic confrontation, sidelining other confrontations, the structure of electoral cleavages per se is largely preserved. Mathematical methods, especially factor analysis, can be efficiently used to detect this structure.

DE "new" poverty; poverty line; median per capita income; rent orientation;

AB The research topic is relevant because the phenomenon of "new" poverty has been recognized as Russia's deep and lingering problem of the 21st century, which is accompanied by underutilization of accumulated human capital and an increased risk of a decline in the economic value of education, which hinders progressive and sustainable economic growth. The aim of the work is to concretize key qualitative features of "new" poverty and substantiate the reproduction of this phenomenon in Russia in 2000- 2023, which is driven by rent-oriented behavior of the state and extreme socio-economic inequality. The methodology of the study is based on a systems approach, analysis using linear and separation methods in relation to identification, and analysis of causes, concomitant factors and consequences; we also use hierarchical classification of variables for clustering Russia's constituent entities taking into account the spread of the phenomenon of absolute monetary poverty. We identify a fundamental condition, main causes determined by extreme socio-economic inequality, and their accompanying factors, which together explain the reproduction of "new" poverty in Russia as a major problem requiring solution at the political level. W consider key qualitative signs of "new" poverty in Russia, revealing its nature in the conditions of rent-oriented behavior of the state. They include social exclusion from the use of resources, various benefits and privileges; coverage of employees with secondary and higher professional education working in different economic sectors, downward professional and qualification mobility; expansion of the "shadow economy of survival", etc. We conduct the clustering of Russia's constituent entities, taking into account the spread of absolute monetary poverty in 2023. We propose some basic and fundamental measures aimed at overcoming poverty (taking into account its "new" quality) and raising Russians' incomes.

ID CRIME
AB One of the topical and timely directions in the development of criminal law science is the expansion of doctrinal ideas about the essence and content of public danger. Taking into account the influence of socio-political processes on criminal legislation and the practice of its application, a rethinking of the conceptual foundations of the theory of social danger is required. In the work, on the basis of identifying dialectical contradictions, regular trends in the development of social danger as a criminal law phenomenon are determined. Such opposites are recognized as the theory of a socially dangerous state of an act and the theory of a socially dangerous state of a person as the basis for criminal liability. Meanwhile, the presented technique also makes it possible to identify gaps and shortcomings in criminal legislation that reduce the effectiveness of legal regulation in the criminal law sphere. As a result of rule-making work, new legislative constructions are fixed in the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, which contradict not only the principles of criminalization, but also the principles of criminal law. The most problematic issues of this order include: criminal law prohibitions that provide for liability for a socially dangerous state of the individual; norms of criminal law providing for an unjustified reduction in the public danger of an act; expansion of compositions with administrative prejudice. They force us to raise the question of the expediency and necessity of their introduction into the criminal law legislation. In the course of the study, the authors substantiate the idea that the criminal law phenomenon of "social danger" is characterized by inverse development trends. The analysis shows that this type of development is characterized by recurring qualitative changes that are present in the criminal law (reducing or increasing social danger) or indicating its loss, which are based on dialectical contradictions. The authors come to the conclusion that there is a dualism in the understanding of public danger, which is recognized as the basis for criminal liability, which is directly enshrined in the construction of the norms of the Special Part of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.

DE commentary; antiquity; Neoplatonism; natural philosophy; "God - Mind

AB The article describes the experience of reading "The Dream of Scipio" - a fragment of the sixth part of Cicero's treatise "On the Commonwealth". The commentary was written by the famous grammarian of late antiquity Macrobius. It is shown how, using the commentary method, Macrobius substantiates the provisions of Neoplatonism, which together form the vector of analysis of the soul and the universe in the era of late antiquity. The commentary is constructed by referring to the triad " God - Mind - Soul". Like Aristotle, Macrobius divides philosophy into ethical, natural, and rational. The article shows how an idea of the universe is formed through reference to each of these parts. Macrobius' natural philosophy is inextricably linked with ethics: " We have a common mind with the stars"; the immortal soul is a particle of the cosmos; virtues are similar to the virtues of the divine Mind. The specificity of the picture of the world in Macrobius's "Commentary on the Dream of Scipio" is defined as follows: the ethical component of the picture of the world includes the idea of the transcendence of the soul, the idea of the descent of the soul into the body, the idea of the immanence of the soul. The natural part of the picture of the world includes the idea of the Demiurge, the idea of the World Soul. The rational segment of the picture of the world is formed on the idea of three natures: God (the One), Mind, and the World Soul. As shown in the " Commentary", the world is a collection of numerical relations; natural is the death in which the end of the body is brought about by the "exhaustion of its numbers"; the soul is a "self-moving number". The soul is not only immortal, it is God. The central place in Macrobius' "Commentary" is occupied by the doctrine of virtues. Their structure is considered; Based on the analysis of the totality of virtues, the " Commentary" concludes that the true reward for fulfilled virtues is a heavenly reward: those who preserved the fatherland are assigned a clearly defined place in heaven. This is the Milky Circle ("It streams everywhere the light called the Milky Way" - "lactea lumen habet"), the blessed enjoy endless life there.

AB The article analyzes the philosophical and allegorical prosimetrum "The Plaint of Nature", written in 1176 by Alan of Lille, the famous representative of the Chartres school, poet, theologian, rhetorician, and preacher. The 12th century became the historical and cultural context for works written in the genre of naturalistic exegesis. The century is characterized as an epoch of cultural renaissance, "extraordinary intellectual ferment" (E. Gilson), as the period of the creation of the first modern European cosmology, focused on a "new sense of nature" and associated with the "premonition" of the spirit of Aristotle's physics. The emphasis in the article is on the Neoplatonic orientation of Alan of Lille's creative heritage. In addition, the relationship of continuity that exists between Bernard Sylvester's "Cosmography" and Alan of Lille's "The Plaint of Nature" is indicated (the perception of Alan's philosophical and allegorical poetics is difficult to imagine and, indeed, simply impossible without referring to "Cosmography", written 40 years before "The Plaint of Nature") The natural-philosophical picture of the universe created by Alan of Lille is distinguished by a system of ideas, images, poetic and philosophical means (metaphors, veils), allowing one to see the role of the poet's philosophical and allegorical findings for the conclusions made by those analyzing "The Plaint of Nature" - in Chartres, Europeans rediscovered nature and described it in a new style, here "poetry has created a kingdom for itself" (P. Burgen), here the author reflects poetically on the structure of the universe, poetry has been turned into the highest point of rational vision, a system of thought (O.S. Voskoboynikov). By turning to the system of ideas, images, poetic and philosophical means, Alan of Lille creates a natural philosophical concept. The picture of the universe proposed within the framework of this concept contributed to the reception of the problems of the philosophy of nature developed by the Chartres school in the medieval West.

DT Article
DE sociolinguistic isomorphism; Ukrainian neologisms; ethnophaulisms;

AB The problem of reflecting the social reactions of society to the complex economic and political problems of our time objectively is becoming increasingly relevant in the modern world. The article is set to analyze how it is possible to monitor the perception of trends in the interaction of states by society, monitoring new word -formation mechanisms and neologisms of the language. The approach is illustrated on the example of the Russian society attitude to what is happening in Ukraine, considering also the reaction of Ukrainians to Russia's actions. Objectivity is ensured through the use of the author's method of "sociolinguistic isomorphism", which establishes the links between socio-political changes in the state and those linguistic mechanisms that the nation uses, when reflecting them through the language units. The study relies on the materials of domestic and Ukrainian mass media, using also theoretical approaches of Russian and foreign scientists. The specificity of the research tasks involves general scientific approaches of political, sociological and philological sciences. The analysis is carried out with the involvement of numerous sources of practical material. The latter implies the sarcastic mood of a rather tolerant Russian society towards "foreigners", and especially towards Ukrainians in the conditions of the Special Military Operation. The language material of related blogs, forums, social networks, official and unofficial publications demonstrates an even greater rejection by the inhabitants of Ukraine of everything connected with the Russian world. The basis for the analysis of practical linguistic material was the linguistic field of ethnophaulisms and other neologisms formed by blending or coming in the form of new borrowings with multifaceted connotations.

AB The article presents the results of an analysis of data obtained during a mass survey conducted in March-June 2023. The object is the working population aged 16 to 60, living in the Ural Federal District and working in various fields of employment: industrial production, mining, education, trade, healthcare, energy, state and municipal administration. The study used an online streaming sample. When forming the sample, a number of target parameters were controlled (screened sample) at the screening stage, which made it possible to ensure that the respondents corresponded to the object of the study: region of residence, actual employment, age, sector of employment. A total of 23,560 questionnaires were collected in 6 regions of the Ural Federal District. The structure of the developed toolkit consists of four blocks of questions and includes original developments and standardized methods aimed at studying various aspects of human well-being. The article presents the results obtained in the block on labor well-being. The analysis revealed gender differences in a number of factors influencing the well-being of workers in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The authors examined gender differences regarding the specifics of formalizing labor relations, enterprise restructuring, and wage reductions; analyzed the attitude of working men and women to the possibility of losing their jobs and the subjective perception of physical and psychosocial health in professional activities. The authors established that, at the present stage, the transformation of the world of work caused by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, although it did not cause a sharp deterioration in the well-being of workers, had a greater impact on the well-being of working women. Women are more likely than men to experience stress and negative emotions in the workplace; they face health problems caused by increased work intensity and more often express concern about the digitalization of work.

AB The article examines the atheological concept of "the most popular Frenchphilosopher" Michel Onfray, as well as his criticism of religion. Onfray borrowsthe term "atheology" from G. Bataille, which he understands as a currentofthought that deconstructs theological truths. The philosopher identifies threeoriginal tasks of atheology: the deconstruction of monotheism, the demytholo-gization of Judeo-Christianity and Islam, and the deconstruction of theocracy.Heimplements all these three tasks in one way or another. The article demon-strates that Onfray's concept of atheology does not represent something radicallynew or significantly different from the existing tradition of religion critique. On-fray limits himself to the three monotheisms that have the greatest political influ-ence and resolutely condemns almost all aspects of the three religions. We notethat in doing so, Onfray simplifies the image of religion, presenting it exclu-sively in a negative light. Such negativism brings Onfray closer not only to con-temporary new atheists, especially C. Hitchens, who believes that "religion poi-sons everything", but also to such representatives of French materialism asHolbach and La Mettrie. Onfray's approach seems abstract because it does notprovide a thorough socio-historical explanation of monotheistic religions. It isshown that his criticism of religion is based on a significant philosophical tradi-tion that goes from Democritus, Lucretius, Epicurus, to Freud, Marx, and Nie-tzsche, and includes French materialists such as Holbach, La Mettrie, Helvetius.His hedonism is more likely to be drawn from the Cyrenaics than from Epicurus.The originality of Onfray's approach lies in the fact that he incorporates materi-alism and hedonism into his concept of "philosophy of nature". Onfray's positiveagenda, although resonant with a number of contemporary issues, is formulatedin extremely general terms and is poorly worked out

TI NEO-ROMANTIC HERO: VITAL CHARACTERS IN HOLGER DRACHMANN'S SHORT STORIES
SO SKANDINAVSKAYA FILOLOGIYA
LA English
DT Article
DE Holger Drachmann; Danish literature; short story; Neo-Romanticism;
   Naturalism; literary hero
AB The article focuses on the specific type of literary hero that is common in the short stories of Holger Drachmann, who was considered the most prominent Danish writer in the early 20th th century. His first books, "Poems" and a collection of short stories, "With Charcoal and Chalk", were published in 1872. At the time, Drachmann belonged to the modernist movement and was one of Georg Brandes' students, but later he changed his political and aesthetic preferences and moved away from the group of Brandes' followers. Drachman's artistic style is very special because it has features of Naturalism, Romanticism, Impressionism and Symbolism. But it is possible to conclude that his artistic manner can be called "neo-romantic" according to the contemporary terminology. The characters in his early collections of short stories are vivid, honest, and strong, and they represent the common type of neo-romantic hero that is inherent in other texts related to Neo-Romanticism. Very often Neo-Romanticism is seen as a "reaction" to Naturalism and a return to the principles of Romanticism, but it seems that Neo-Romanticism is much more like Naturalism than Romanticism. The type of neo-romantic hero is closer to naturalistic characters than to romantic characters, because it is a courageous and extraordinary person, an outsider and a rebel, his life is full of desire, risk and adventure, and it looks like a romantic hero, but a neo-romantic hero is a physically and mentally healthy person, and this character is determined by nature and genesis, which is the main feature of Naturalism. Drachman creates a new type of hero in Danish literature: the vital, strong character who struggles with nature and circumstances. His characters have the healthy genetics of ordinary people. Neo-Romanticism in Danish literature was strongly influenced by Naturalism and was the original phenomenon of national literature.

DT Article
DE atemporality; quasi-space; transcendence; understanding
AB The article deals with the problem of time and the property of the subject to leave time. In temporal existence, the subject moves together with surrounding things in the same stream of time. However, within itself the subject emerges into a transcendental quasi-space. He builds it himself in his mental world. The layer of immanence (in the temporal sense of the word) does not allow for understanding, does not allow for real thinking. A conversation in terms of immanence can only develop according to the "stimulus-response" type, without a plan and without addressing one's own idea of truth, since truth requires timelessness. The concept of "objectification" introduced by Whorf, as well as the ideas of the temporal horizon of Bergson and Husserl are considered. The second part of the article examines the timelessness of meaning. Meaning "lives" in the timeless space of meanings. The normativity of logic also has a timeless character. Even when we listen to music, we step out of time and constitute its pattern, the logic of its unfolding. The subject of music is the coagulation of time into intelligible structures. Reflection is considered as belonging to the timeless layer of consciousness. We place our thinking among timeless entities: values, assessments, goals, projects, truths. A project of thought can unfold in time, this is an intuitive type of thinking, but it can also reach universal positions. Thus the subject is dual. It belongs to two ontological regions: temporal and atemporal. The last paragraph of the article briefly discusses Losev's theory "On the Method of Infinitesimals in Logic", which states that the subject perceives the world through derivatives in the sense of mathematical analysis, and then performs integration in order to thus obtain an atemporal concept of a thing. In conclusion, I staate that the mechanism for escaping time is still unclear, but the exit itself has been given to us. The subject's relationship to transcendence is the subject's exit from time. There would be no concept of time if there were no communion with the eternal.

AB Roerich's Central Asian expedition was truly unique and large-scale. The route traveled by the expedition was complex and varied, including mountain passes at high altitudes and the territories of five different states. As the head of the expedition, Nicholas Roerich was assigned certain tasks related to the study and description of various aspects of the life of the countries under study. An overview of the social life, economic situation and political preferences of the population, as well as an analysis of the influence of various countries in Central Asia were all part of the work of the expedition. The expeditionary achievements of the Roerichs are extensive and deserve the attention of historians, ethnologists, linguists, and art historians. The results of the expedition are confirmed by the rich artistic and ethnographic heritage that was created, collected and processed by the Roerich family. Their expeditionary diary is of great interest for cross-cultural analysis, as well as the study of the features of the iconogra- phy of the paintings of N.K.R.

DE least developed countries; global climate change; climate policy;

AB Global climate change is one of the main challenges of our time. Rising temperatures threaten the stability of the ecological, socio-economic, and political systems around the globe. Countries in the Global South have the greatest material losses from climate change without having a significant impact on it. The high vulnerability of the group of least developed countries (LDCs) to climate change, coupled with social and economic challenges poverty, and lack of means for adaptation, determine its special rank and status in international climate policy. In it, the LDCs act as a single actor. Over the course of more than 30 years of climate policy, LDCs have initiated the adoption of a number of important documents and the creation of fundamental structures for international climate policy. At the same time, noticeable transformations have taken place to adapt and decarbonize the national structures of LDCs. The purpose of this article is to show the role of the LDC group in the formation of the United Nations (UN) climate agenda, institutional structures, and international mechanisms, to highlight their efforts to restore global climate justice, and to characterize modern national climate policy according to the legal documents adopted by the LDCs. The methodological basis is formed by historical, comparative approaches. The main objective of the article is to study the trajectories of the climate policy of the LDC group, highlight the stages of its evolution, demonstrate centre-peripheral relations to restore climate justice, and examine the internal policies of the LDCs. Policy initiatives of the LDCs played a direct role in the formation of climate finance funds, the group of experts on the least developed countries (LEG), and national programmes and plans for the adaptation of states to climate change. The article concludes that there are two stages in the development of climate policy in LDCs; it is assumed that the use of international mechanisms for adaptation and decarbonization could become a tool for the economic and technological modernization of LDCs and their achievement of the sustainable development goals of 2030. The main obstacles to this are the insufficient financing of available funds from countries of the Global North, high interest rates on loans, and the indebtedness of LDCs.

Drawing on existing scholarly works and research, the study aims to describe the status of the Metis people, recently recognized as an indigenous nation of the country, and their language. It delves into the historical formation of the Metis nation and its current state, providing a demolinguistic profile of the Metis population today. Statistical data from recent censuses is included. The novelty of this research lies in its examination of the contemporary situation of the Metis people with a focus on existing laws and judicial decisions impacting all aspects of their lives. An overview of anthropological and sociolinguistic studies on Metis people conducted by scholars over the past decades is offered. The author emphasizes the functional characteristics of the Metis language, Michif, outlining its ethnic and social functions. The article also discusses policies concerning Metis people in the realms of social, economic, and political rights. The relevance of this study is underscored by the heightened attention from Russian and global societies towards language situations and solutions to linguistic issues in polyethnic states, as well as the preservation of indigenous languages.

AB The research comes up with the reconstruction of the biography of one of the most prominent historical figures of Ancient Rus' of the 12th century - Novgorod boyar Raguil Dobrynich, involving special methods of cognition (historical-analytical and problematical-chronological). The materials constituting the basis of the study were analyzed taking into account the chronology of events and the need to obtain historical information from the scientific sources under study. The authors used the method of comparative and retrospective analysis when comparing different theoretical views upon the chosen issue. The paper provides a historiographic analysis of the issue and identifies the main relevant sources in question. Basing on the texts of Old Russian chronicles, as well as the contents of birch bark letter No. 831, the authors reconstructed the Novgorod period of the biography of Raguil Dobrynich, and outlined his role in the historical events associated with the expulsion and murder of Prince Igor Olegovich. The study pays special attention to the analysis of the historical events of 1170 related to the revolt of the Novgorod squad against their prince Vladimir Mstislavich, in which Raguil Dobrynich played a key role. The research allowed concluding that Raguil Dobrynich belonged to the glorious Novgorod Dobrynich family and was the son of the eighth Novgorod mayor. With the squad of Prince Vladimir Mstislavich, he took part in many historical events of the second half of the 12th century and ended his political career in one of the administrative positions in ancient Novgorod.

DE indexical; semantics; meaning; predicate transfer; ellipsis
AB In this paper, I continue to defend the thesis of automatic reference of the indexical "I" in the so-called I-cases, i.e., sentences where reference-shifting seems to occur: " I am parked out back" referring to the speaker's car or "I am on a purple square / Baltic Avenue" referring to the speaker's game piece. In the previous paper, I demonstrated that one can correctly interpret such sentences without denying the thesis of automatic reference of "I". I proposed my agency account where I-cases are sentences with the VP reduction where the property the speaker predicates to herself is a property of having done a particular action in the past. This paper focuses on some possible objections to my agency account. The first objection concerns the possibility to construct semantically equivalent sentences to I-cases with the help of reflexive verbs. This objection is based on the Russian grammar, where one can change the verb form with attaching the postfix -sya/- s' to it. So, "I am parked outback" may have a semantic equivalent in Russian that may be literally translated into English like "I parked myself outback". I conclude that the first objection does not disprove the agency account. The only thing this objection tries to do is to challenge the agency account with the need to explain why I-cases are acceptable in some communicative situations and are not in another. However, to address the challenge, one needs to investigate the pragmatics of I-cases, which is not the main task of the agency account. The second objection says that sometimes the agency account requires the modification of the grammar form of I-cases, which means that the logical form of an I-case does not reflect its grammar form in natural language. I argue that the lack of such reflection cannot be a reason to reject the agency account. The strict agreement between two forms of a sentence is not a necessary requirement for any account. The third objection is an objection from the lack of action. Since the agency account says that the sense of agency is implied in the semantics of "I", it faces an issue with a speaker's use of I-cases in a situation where the action was not done by the speaker herself. To answer this objection, I propose to add the idea that the sense of subjectivity is also implied in the semantics of "I" into the agency account. By subjectivity here I mean a property of being an experiencer predicated to a speaker. Hence, only the third objection jeopardizes the agency account, but one can answer it by recognizing the semantic indeterminacy of "I".

DE online radicalization; age-related vulnerabilities; social networks
AB The article examines online radicalization of youth on social networks. Based on a review of the existing literature on radicalization, I first defined its understanding. Having examined the existing approaches, I joined the opinion that radicalism leads to violence only in some cases. I distinguish between "cognitive" radicalization, or the formation of extreme beliefs, and "behavioral" radicalization, which leads to extremist behavior. Thus, radicalization is the process of accepting certain ideas that can lead to possible violent actions. Online radicalization is a reality that has emerged in the last 10-15 years due to the rapid development of online social networks. I understand it as the formation of radical views, yet mainly through interaction with various types of Internet content and not direct personal communication or written study of propaganda materials. Further, also based on monitoring of relevant sources, I developed a model of risk factors that can trigger the radicalization process. Of the many possible factors, I chose, in my opinion, the most significant ones. Firstly, these are social macro-level risk factors that violate norms and homeostasis, creating internal tensions, namely: the ongoing conflict with the West and existential threats of its escalation, the prevalence of ideologies that justify violence, the formation of a new information and semantic environment of fakes and simulacra, socio-economic problems, dangers of social disintegration. Secondly, these are age-psychological risk factors for changes in the consciousness and behavior of young people in a harmful direction, namely: the search for a new belonging, provocative behavior and nonconformism. I believe that the onset of radicalization among young people is initiated by the inability of some of them to satisfactorily solve their age-related developmental tasks in the context of increasing problematization of the social environment. Finally, I presented a model of the mechanisms of online radicalization as the realization of offline potential. These are interconnected mechanisms, namely: compensation for vulnerability, consolidation of isolation through online immersion, facilitation, echo chambers, acceleration of radicalization, launching actions offline.

AB The life path of Professor E. A. Engel' is connected with the history of a number of educational institutions in St. Petersburg. Despite the fact that Evgenii Aleksandrovich was a well-known scientist and socio-political figure of the first quarter of the XX century, no full-fledged biography of him has been written. However, some information has been preserved in different sources. This is the reason for the purpose and objectives of this study: on the basis of archival documents, first introduced into the scientific circulation, to detail the biography of a well-known in Petrograd major scientist, social activist and talented teacher, who made a significant contribution to the development of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the Leningrad University and the Faculty of Economics and Politics of the Leningrad Agricultural Institute. The article is based on a thorough search work. The materials of his personal file kept at the St. Petersburg State Agrarian University and documents from the archival funds of the central archival repositories of St. Petersburg were involved. The study used biographical and prosopographical methods to trace the fate of an individual through his or her career practices. The biographical method has been ignored by academic science for some time because of its seemingly low representativeness. But the personification of history allows us to see the person behind socio-political and economic events, to analyze the influence of external factors on his life. The prosopographical method allowed us to trace the typical features of career development for its time. Engel' did not occupy any leading positions before the revolution, but he repeated the fate of many nominees of the young republic, when the << correct >> social origin and party affiliation compensated for the lack of administrative experience. He joined the RSDLP as early as 1902 and after the Second Congress supported the Bolsheviks; thanks to his active work in the party, he acquired useful acquaintances. Like many of his contemporaries, after the October Revolution of 1917 Evgenii Aleksandrovich combined many responsible positions, being, for example, at one time dean of different faculties in two higher educational institutions. His personal file is cut off at the very peak of his active work. It is difficult to say how his life path went in the 1930s and when he completed it: the fate of E. A. Engel' dissolved in the abyss of events that swept Russia. A. Engel's fate dissolved in the abyss of events that swept Russia. The reconstructed biography of the famous scientist, Professor E. A. Engel', whose life was connected with a number of higher educational institutions of Leningrad, can become a good source of commemorative practices and strengthen the sense of unity of corporate community through the representation of past events.

DE deliberation; fake news; artificial intelligence; democracy;
   disinformation
AB The authors of the article begin by justifying the relevance of the problem of fake news in the modern political discourse. It is noted that today the author of news can be not only a human, but also artificial intelligence. This makes it difficult to discern where the truth is and where lies are. The consumer reaction is manifested in the closure and reduction of interaction with both information and newsmakers, including ordinary Internet users. This behavior is contrary to the principles of democracy, which requires deliberation. The authors pose the question of whether deliberation and the natural desire to avoid information noise and the influence of fake news can be combined. The article hypothesizes that deliberation, which requires the collation of knowledge and promotes mutual learning, has the potential to reduce the disinformation of everyone involved in the discussion. It can also help make sense of the news flow, including by reducing the cognitive complexity of dealing with large flows of uncertain information. After reviewing the current research on citizens' ability to identify fake news, the authors found no account of deliberation among them. The authors then designed their own empirical study, which included an interview component. The participants were asked to determine the credibility of political news (real and two types of fake news - compiled by humans and AI) independently and in a group discussion. The influence of alternative factors, such as political science competence, news experience, and others, was recorded using control groups and interviews. The findings of the experiment do not support the hypothesis that deliberative practices and alternative factors (with the exception of news experience) play a significant role in combating disinformation. However, the consensual potential of collective deliberation is noted: it facilitates the formation of a consensus opinion without affecting the correct answers. The authors note the weakness of neural networks in creating authentic falsifications in comparison to humans. The authors emphasize the necessity for a further study of individual factors not covered by the research that affect the variation of respondents' answers.

AB The subject. The article discusses the scientific foundations of the cult of a written constitution, the relationship between the principles of the supremacy of the constitution and fidelity to the constitution, on the one hand, and the forms and methods of constitutional changes in modern democratic states, on the other hand. The aim of the article is to reveal the dilemmas of legal constitutionalism in the context of the formation of doctrinal foundations and the practice of applying deliberative and dialogical constitutionalism in modern jurisprudence and the practice of constitutional development. Methodology. The author uses deliberative and epistemological approaches, methods of formal-legal, concrete-historical, comparative constitutional-legal and complex analysis. Main results, scope of application. A special field of knowledge is being formed, which is called "comparative constitutional changes". The scientific school of constitutionalism proposes to see the purpose of this field of knowledge in the development and improvement of forms and methods of participation of the people, citizens, civil society, professional and expert opinion in constitutional changes. The study provides a critical constitutional analysis of the peculiarities of the nature of all-Russian voting and the legal positions of the body of constitutional justice in Russia on the issue of all-Russian voting, prospects for improving the principle of popular sovereignty and the institutions of citizen's participation, civil society, professional and expert opinion in the Russian constitutional doctrine and in legislation. Conclusions. The cult of a written constitution dominates in the contemporary world of democratic constitutional states that differ in socio-economic and political-legal indicators of their development on the geopolitical and legal map of the planet. In the practice of contemporary states, except for the adoption of a draft new constitution, the most common practice is to express individual preferences ("for" or "against") citizens regarding the content of each amendment or several interrelated amendments. The theory of deliberative constitutionalism is multifaceted and is intended to scientifically substantiate the prospect of expanding the constitutional basis for democratic decision-making and creating a democratic basis for constitutional change. Deliberative constitutionalism, as a theory of engagement in constitutional communication, serves the purpose of seeking collective wisdom in matters of constitutional design and constitutional change. The cult of a written constitution is combined with an inclusive constitutional paradigm for the development of democratic states, which involves the development of deliberative and imperative forms of citizen's participation. Russian constitutionalism needs to further expand popular participation in the development and discussion of decisions of a constitutional nature.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Arendt; Heidegger; language and thinking; metaphor; storm of time; storm

AB Hannah Arendt's report "Martin Heidegger at Eighty" is generally seen as a defensive speech, seemingly intended to honor his philosophical achievements at the end of his life and to mitigate the reputational damage caused by his past political mistakes. The personal relationship between Arendt and Heidegger is often cited as the reason for the disturbing fact that such a statement was made by a prominent scholar of totalitarianism. This article examines Arendt's text from a new perspective, viewing it as a departure from Heidegger's position rather than a celebration of it. The hypothesis is proposed by shifting the focus to the form of expression, which can provide insight into the content. The anniversary speech is filled with poetic imagery and contains numerous allusions to both literary and philosophical works. The article analyzes Arendt's comparison of Heidegger with the "hidden king", which has its roots in the Romantic tradition. The use of Novalis's novel, from which the title was probably borrowed, contributes to the discovery of additional meanings. Arendt's text presents a semantically rich metaphor, "the storm of thinking", that can be deployed through a network of intertextual references. These references include the Socratic comparison of thought to an invisible storm, the Platonic image of the storm that appears in the finale of Heidegger's Rector's Speech, the "wind from paradise" that picks up Benjamin's Angel of History, and the changeability of the cloudy sky from Rilke's "Sonnets to Orpheus". The metaphorical structure of Arendt's essay is explored, reflecting her own understanding of the role of language in thinking and the importance of literary discourse.

AB The purpose of the publication is to raise the issue of overcoming the neocolonial discourse in the presentations of Russian cultural heritage objects and to present their own, as it seems to the authors, original experience of "horizontal" construction of a certain historical and cultural landscape. The sources of the study were, first of all, the materials of the included observation of the authors of the article, as well as "typical descriptions" of regional (Tatarstan) material and non -material cultural objects. Today, there are conditions for creating tourist facilities that, on the one hand, can be commercially significant, and on the other - form brands of territories and become factors of socio-cultural development. In this regard, there is a need to develop a definition of an "integral tourist object" - this is a set of material and non -material included in a logically unified narrative, which is represented for commercial purposes to meet cognitive needs. Such objects arise within the framework of the historical and cultural landscape - a set of material and immaterial objects realized by contemporaries as a single spatial location, which is recognized as illustrative and visual additions to the generally accepted historical narratives. In modern Russia, the construction of integral tourist sites and historical and cultural landscapes is closely related to the peculiarities of the historical and political development of the state, namely, the phenomenon of "internal colonization". The presence of a clearly defined "center" and "periphery", resembling the "metropolis" and "colonies" in the specifics of the relationship, is reflected in the hierarchy of images of the so-called "cultural heritage". Within Kazan, the village of Yudino, located on the outskirts of the city and belonging to Kirovsky district, can claim the role of a new tourist object. The objects of the village of Yudino can be designated as a historical and cultural landscape, on the basis of which, in turn, an integral tourist object can be constructed. Below is an anthropological description of the locality, which, in turn, can, taking into account the adaptation, become the basis of an excursion story.

AB At the beginning of the 20th century, the Northwestern Territory of the Russian Empire, which included the Vilna, Kovno and Grodno provinces, was a tangled knot of ethno-confessional, socio-economic and political problems and contradictions caused by the challenges of the new era and requiring an adequate and prompt solution from the local authorities. To the long-term and already familiar to the local administration problems associated with the need for Russification and depolonization of the region, new questions were added, caused by the growing labor movement, which had a special ethnic specificity in the region. The purpose of this article is to identify the main problem points in the activities of the administration of the North-West Territory, isolating from them the shortcomings inherent in the bureaucratic apparatus of the Russian Empire at the beginning of the 20th century as a whole and the problems characteristic of this particular region. The study is based on archival and published historical sources of various types, some of which are introduced into scientific circulation for the first time, allowing you to get an idea of various management practices in the region, conflict situations, many of which were due to the personal characteristics of local management personnel. An important source containing not only information about the state of the region, but also specific proposals to improve the efficiency of local authorities is theA" All-Subject Report" of the Governor-General of Vilna, Prince P.D. Svyatopolk-Mirsky, some plots of which are still insufficiently researched. The article examines the main problems of regional management of the north-western outskirts of Russia, which are characteristic of the empire as a whole, which include the lack of a legal framework that corresponded to the realities of the time, the short-term tenure of governors in their posts and the inconsistency of personnel policy in relation to the regional administration, the low level of competence of regional officials at various levels, refusal to cooperate with local public forces, to which the regional authorities experienced a steady distrust. The proposals put forward by P.D. Svyatopolk-Mirsky consisted in developing a modern legal framework for local administration activities, and also defined decentralization of the management system through the transfer of some powers from central departments to managing departments. Based on the material studied, it is concluded that at the beginning of the 20th century, the organization of the work of the imperial administration of the North-Western Territory did not correspond to the realities of the time and faced the need forAa global reorganization, the degree of its effectiveness depended on the further stay of the region within the Russian Empire.

AB There is a commonplace in the historical scholarship that nomadic peoples, adopting a settled way of life, borrow from the agrarian sedentary population their methods of economy managing and state administration. Chinese historical tradition tells that the nomadic periphery fell under Chinese influence and adopted from the Han people both their political and economic institutions. However, sources let us know that the situation is not so simple. There are periods of reverse influence of the nomadic world on agrarian China. In the pre-Mongolian period, the Chinese empire was at the same time at the peak of its development, stood on the threshold of the industrial revolution, but was also heavily dependent on its neighbors, being forced to pay tribute to them. Practices of regular close interaction led to diffusion, that is, the mutual borrowing of various management methods. Using the example of the Chinese Song Empire and its neighbors of the Western Xia and Liao empires, the article shows that borrowings did not always go exclusively from the Han to nomads, but, on the contrary, there was a mutual penetration of both economic and political institutions in the sphere of finance and taxation.

ID INEQUALITY
AB Social inequality is a phenomenon that is ambivalent in its consequences. On the one hand, social inequality stimulates creative and entrepreneurial activity; on the other hand, it provokes social discontent. At the same time, the attitude towards inequality that has developed in the society is of particular importance. Perception of inequality as unfair is fraught with delegitimization of the upper class, loss of social trust between strata, and anomie. The article attempts to answer the following questions: what type of inequality do Russians agree to consider fair, what methods of enrichment and social ascent are legitimized by public consciousness? Empirically, the study is based on a series of focus groups conducted by the authors in 2013 and 2023. The study found that in modern Russia, the majority of the population criminalizes wealth, regardless of its origin, considering it "dishonest". In the eyes of Russians, only those who serve their country, provide noble help to people and, finally, possess great talent, which is used for the benefit of everyone, are entitled to receive high income. The mass consciousness rejects the idea of inheriting status and capital, which is manifested, in particular, in a very critical attitude towards the generation of children of the post-Soviet elite. The study showed that the Russians' dream fair society is radically different from the existing one. At the same time, the authors documented a trend towards an increase in social pessimism associated with a feeling of injustice of the socio-economic system based on the cult of money, and an increase in anomie, corroding the body of society.

AB The article is devoted to the comprehension of the current vertical mobility channels in Russian politics. Not only the stability, functioning and development of the political system, but also the maintenance of the legitimacy of the ruling class depend on their parameters and efficiency. Based on long-term monitoring of the political elite recruitment, we analyzed the educational and professional experience of the current establishment members, as well as their geographical mobility. Total number of the studied group as of 01.01.2024 amounted to 885 people. The best prospects for an upward career trajectory are given to people born in Moscow, less often in St. Petersburg. People who grew up in the regions, to increase their chances, must move to 5 hub cities, from which their opportunities to enter the elite sharply increase. Our analysis of educational mobility also shows overconcentration: three universities prevail in the rating of elite universities - Lomonosov Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and MGIMO University. Professional upward flows are also characterized by low throughput: political career is promoted by three spheres of activity - housing, utilities and construction, finance and law. Overconcentration of upward mobility flows leads to negative consequences: the political system is perceived by citizens as unfair; the elite is largely delegitimized. This situation also hinders the development of meritocratic mechanisms selecting personnel for the establishment. To optimize the selection process, it is necessary to strengthen competition in selection, which will improve the quality of incorporated personnel and increase the ability of the system to withstand threats and challenges.

AB The study aims to show the importance of Egypt in the implementation by the United States of the idea of creating a military-political bloc in the Middle East in the first half of the 1950s. The projected alliance was supposed to beAan analogue of NATO in this region, potentially projecting the geopolitical interests of Washington and aimed at curbing the penetration of the "communist threat" into it. The source base of the study includes documents from the administrations of the US Presidents, as well as materials from the archive of the foreign policy of the Russian Federation, defining the place of Egypt in American regional interests. Analysis of international agreements ("Joint Defense and Economic Cooperation Treaty Between the States of the Arab Le ague" and Baghdad Pact) makes it possible to highlight the foreign policy positions of the Arab states in the early 1950s. G. Nasser's programmatic work "The Philosophy of the Revolution" forms an idea of the main directions of Egypt's foreign policy, and the memoirs of the British Foreign Minister A. Eden and the confidant G. Nasser M. Heikal provide an understanding of the mechanism for making political decisions in the implementation of bloc projects. The article substantiates the activation of the initiative to create a military-political bloc in the Middle East with the participation of Egypt by the US: Aduring this period, Britain's position weakened, Arab-Jewish confrontation intensified, the revolution of "free officers" in Egypt and the subsequent transformation of its foreign policy course took place. The authors describe several successive attempts by the US to implement the idea of the "Middle East Command" bloc. Attention is focused on the role of Egypt's position in the failure of such projects as the "Middle East Command" (MEC), "Middle East Defense Organization" (MEDO). The process of creating the Baghdad Pact with the corresponding reaction of Egypt are considered. The reasons have been established that the stake on Egypt as a key player in the region and a potential leader of the military-political bloc initiated by the US turned out to be untenable. In Egypt, the radical course of the revolution prevailed, charting the way to unite the Arabs in the struggle against the colonial past, with which both the UK and the US were associated, trying to replace it in the region. The attempts of the American administration to achieve coexistence in a single bloc between Egypt and Israel turned out to be in vain: Cairo's bid for leadership in the Arab world could not be matched with peace initiatives against the Israeli side. The concept of the Baghdad Pact was implemented, but in the matter of the planned prospects for expansion it ran into a number of obstacles, which were also associated with the confrontational position of Egypt, which was gaining weight in the Arab world and did not deny the prospects of military-political cooperation with the USSR.

AB Introduction. The article analyzes the biography and diplomatic activities of Nikolai Vasilievich Novikov (1903-1989), a Soviet diplomat who represented the USSR in Cairo and in Washington during World War II and took part in the efforts to establish a new system of international relations at the beginning of the Cold War. Methods and materials. The article is based on published texts by Nikolai Novikov himself, diplomatic documents, periodicals, and materials from his personal archive, deposited in the Archive of the European University at St. Petersburg by the diplomat's family. Analysis. The authors examine Novikov's biography, the reasons for his rapid career in the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, his relations with Soviet foreign policy managers, and the circumstances of his resignation at a relatively young age. Special attention is paid to Novikov's activities in the United States in the context of the emerging Cold War, the place of Novikov's note (cable) in the process of shaping Soviet approaches to relations with the United States, and his own attitude to these approaches. Results. Novikov's contribution to the shaping of the postwar world is underappreciated, as are his attempts to resist the changes that were breaking Soviet -American cooperation in the international arena. In fact, the strategic concepts formulated by Novikov in a memo to Molotov were the basis of the official Soviet interpretation of the causes and nature of the Cold War and were included in Soviet school and university textbooks on universal history and the history of international relations. Authors'contributions. A.I. Kubyshkin analyzed the most important stages of Nikolai Novikov's diplomatic activity and the general situation in relations between the USSR and the USA during the Second World War. He assessed Novikov's activities from the political leadership of the USSR and foreign countries in which the Soviet diplomat worked. He also examined the most important aspects of the activities of Soviet diplomacy reflected in Novikov's memoirs and carried out their internal criticism as a historical source. I.I. Kurilla processed the archive of Nikolai Novikov and identified and analyzed the corpus of sources of personal origin. He also analyzed the contents of Nikolai Novikov's personal diaries, reviewed the personal contribution of N.V. Novikov in developing a strategy in relations with the United States in the initial period of the Cold War, and compared the contents of the "long telegram" of J. Kennan and the "Novikov telegram".

DT Article
DE political theory; social movements; history of ideas; hegemony;

ID REVOLUTION
AB The current article examines the notion of transformism within the framework of Gramscian theories. This term was initially used to describe parliamentary politics in Italy and meant the cooptation of radical parties into the government under the leadership of moderate parties and the subsequent moderation of radical parties. Antonio Gramsci rethinks transformism and defines it as the strengthening of the ruling class through the absorption of active elements from other classes. Although this can be found in works of some scholars utilizing different Gramscian approaches, it still requires some concretization. The article examines the development of this notion in Gramsci's texts as well as its usage in the Gramscian political economy and Ernesto Laclau's theory. The article demonstrates that the notion of transformism can be applied to social movements studies. Under conditions of transformism separate achievements of social movements turn into strategic failures. The functioning of transformism is based mainly on trade-offs between upper and lower classes. Upper classes satisfy some demands from below and lower classes constrain their discontent to cooperate with upper classes. Transformism amounts to the absence of independence of social movements, their readiness for trade-offs, cooperation with the authorities and parliamentary mechanisms as well as organizational weakness.

ID PUBLIC SPHERE
AB The article is devoted to the discursive discovery and subsequent framing of loneliness in the late Soviet society. The author is interested in how, in the late 1960s Soviet Union, the phenomenon of loneliness, previously described by international journalists as a consequence of the capitalist system, along with mass homelessness, unemployment, alienation, and atomization, was discovered, ideologically neutralized, and became part of the social policies of the late Soviet state. The article describes a meeting held in the editorial office of Literaturnaya Gazeta on June 20, 1967, where a closed discussion about loneliness took place. The purpose of the discussion was to discuss an article by a Czechoslovak journalist about the experience of discovering loneliness in the Czechoslovak SSR, developing strategies for describing it and inventing ways of overcoming it, such as marriage advertisements in rural and urban newspapers, as well as specialized dating services that provided professional help in finding a soul mate. The author defines the conditions for the emergence of such a discussion and approaches to the recruitment of experts who were part of the editorial policies of the renewed Litgazeta and the representation of Soviet human sciences in the space of public media. The paper examines the post-war history of the transformation of discussion as a special kind of discursive genre and practice of social interaction sensitive to changes in the system of social relations. It also focuses on the struggle between different discourses to define the meaning of loneliness during the discussion. The author turns to the discourse analysis model developed by Laclau and Mouffe to investigate the course of this struggle and to identify political implicatures in the speeches of the discussion participants. A list of discourses used by experts to fix the meaning of loneliness has been identified, and antagonistic continua of meanings have been revealed. These meanings shaped the strategies of institutionalization of loneliness that followed the discussion.

AB The Novosibirsk State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater is an architectural monument of federal significance. Most of the metropolis residents consider it as the brand of the city. Architects and designers strongly support this opinion. However, the attitude of the artists towards this building is rather contradictory. The author explores the ambiguous reflection of the image of the opera house in the works of Novosibirsk artists of different periods. He goes into detail describing the internal political situation during the design and construction of the theater, which has far-reaching consequencesin every area of life. He also finds the root causes of this not only in the creative attitudes of the painters, but also in the building itself, its architectural style, town planning, artistic features, historical, social and political vicissitudes associated with it. The policy of the authorities was expressed in the establishment of total control over creative organizations, the rapid change and imposition of stylistic attitudes in the 1930s, which led to the violent breakdown of the creative positions of recognized masters. There were significant economic costs associated with the reconstruction of most of recently erected buildings. There took place unjustified reprisals against designers and builders either. The final result of the global construction is viewed not just as a theater building, but as a monument to the official imperial policy in general and in the field of culture in particular. In addition to the image assessment, the status of the building in the urban planning situation of the city also changed over time. Building around it became denser, the unsuccessful park design of the theater square with the construction of a dense sculptural group in front of the building and the haphazard construction of high-rise buildings in the background led to the object's loss of compositional dominance in the city center. As a result, some authors became interested in it but some of the artist skept indifferent not only to the theatre but to Novosibirsk as well. Their works are always esteemed comprehensively from the historical, social and art history points of view. The classification of the urban landscape, developed by the author in previous articles, helps him to approach the study systematically. He is able now to determine the role of the object of study in works of fine art and graphic design and the significance of this object for the artists themselves.

AB Introduction. This article reveals the political activities of John VII Palaiologos, who struggled against Manuel II Palaiologos (1391-1425) for the title of heir, and later on for power over the Byzantine Empire. John VII's political portrait, created primarily by his competitor, presents John VII as the main culprit in inciting civil strife and involving the empire's main enemies, the Ottomans, in its internal affairs. The purpose of the work is to raise and answer the question of how well John VII deserved this assessment. Methods and materials. The article has analysed the information provided by Byzantine historical and rhetorical works, Russian chronicles, and the accounts of Western writers. The said information has been researched within the context of the political events in Byzantium in the second half of the fourteenth and early-fifteenth centuries. Analysis. As a son of Andronikos IV, John VII had every reason for his dynastic claims, as he received the title of co-ruler as early as 1377. Additionally, he could lay claim to the throne by the right of primogeniture. He also won the sympathies of a part of the citizens of the imperial capital, who viewed him as an "Andronikos' son," the legitimate contender for the throne. However, when struggling for power, he relied on the Ottomans, who were interested in maintaining political instability in the empire. John VII and Manuel II tried to resolve the dynastic conflict several times, and only the early death of John VII finally ended the feud. Results. The conclusion is that John VII Palaiologos, who had reasons to become a hero of his time, finally became an anti-hero.

AB At the beginning of the XXth century, the transformation of the consciousness of the Russian peasantry sharply increased its momentum, and in addition to the traditional factors that influenced this, the generational factor should also be distinguished. The article explores the historical memory of the generation of the << revolutionary turning point >> about the revolutionary events of 1905-1907 in the Russian village. The problem of the historical memory of the generation rarely becomes the subject of research by Russian historians. At the same time, the generation of the << revolutionary turning point >> undoubtedly accumulated a very significant social experience, the study of the memory of which is a really important historical problem. The purpose of the study is to eliminate the gap in scientific knowledge on the designated topic. The study is built on the principles of historicism and objectivity using historical-comparative, deductive and retrospective methods. The authors rely on the theoretical and methodological approaches of generational research formulated by K. Manheim and P. Nora. The object of the study is the historical memory of the radicals of the generation of the << revolutionary turning point >>, who was born at the end of the XIX century, and who took an active part in the revolutionary events of 1905-1907 in the Russian village. The source base of the study is the materials of the foundation of the Society of Political Prisoners and Exiled Settlers of the State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF), including biographical questionnaires, memoirs and other accompanying materials of representatives of the generation of the << revolutionary turning point >> involved in the revolutionary process in the village in 1905-1907. Memoirs represent the most valuable material on the study of the historical memory of the generation about the events of the first Russian revolution. Analysis of this material allows you to identify a specific generational style and the sources of its formation. The analysis of the sources suggests that the development of an independent generational style among the youth of the << revolutionary turning point >> was reflected in the historical memory of the generation about the revolutionary events in the village in 1905-1907. This is not only about the specific and completely new agitation and propaganda work for the generation to organize cells in the village. but also about the social experience of solidarity between the revolutionaries themselves, as well as about trying to establish contacts within the framework of the principle of joint action between the revolutionary element and the villagers. Representatives of the generation were driven not only by revolutionary ideas, but also by revolutionary emotions, which was reflected in memories.

AB Historical-revolutionary and memorial museums of political figures began to be created already in the first decade of the formation of Soviet power. Museums helped the new government in solving its primary task - legitimation, which is closely related to the recoding of space at all levels, including cultural memory. At Tomsk State University, the Museum of V. V. Kuibyshev was opened on January 24, 1953.
   The acquisition of the museum's collection began thanks to significant research and organizational work done by the first head of the museum, V.S. Sinyaev. He identified and collected documents about the life and work of V.V. Kuibyshev from central museums and archives; gift materials were received from relatives of V.V. Kuibyshev. The museum's fund consisted of 675 items.
   The structure of the museum room fund included documents; photographs reflecting the life and work of V.V. Kuibyshev; phonodocuments: a record with a voice recording of V.V. Kuibyshev and five gramophone records that personally belonged to him; objects of material culture - awards, notebook, calendar, pencil case, suitcase, books, death mask.
   The first exhibition of the museum was compiled according to a chronological principle. It is characteristic that to determine the chronological framework, it was not events related to the life of V.V. Kuibyshev, but changes in the socio-political life of the country. Thus, the first section reflected the life of V.V. Kuibyshev from birth to 1905, the next section ended in February 1917, then the exhibition presented the period of preparation and conduct of the October Revolution, then the period of the Civil War, the final part of the exhibition was materials about the activities of V.V. Kuibyshev in the first years of the formation of Soviet power.
   Museum staff provided consultations for teachers and students on the history of the revolutionary movement in Tomsk and the biography of V. V. Kuibyshev; provided copies of documents for the organization of school museums in Tomsk, Moscow, Leningrad, Belarus. Currently, a significant part of the storage items from the "V.V. Kuibyshev" is part of the fund of the TSU History Museum.

AB The study takes a neo-institutional approach to the history of science and is based on unpublished sources. The period of the Great Patriotic War is recognised as a special one in historiography, but the author seeks to show the connection between the scientific research of ancient historians of LOII and the preceding and subsequent period of science development. So work on World History, begun in the pre-war period, was continued during the war years, but at the end of 1944 the edition was deemed inexpedient. The author comes to the conclusion that, as a rule, scientists did not concentrate only on propaganda work and giving popular scientific lectures, but put in their plans purely scientific questions of a diverse nature that fell out of the scope of planned topics formulated by the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, which was not opposed by the leadership. The control over the activities of the LOII staff located in different cities of the USSR until 1944 was relatively weak and formal: the completion of topics was constantly postponed to subsequent years. The nature and content of the reports of the staff of the ancient world group of the LOII (S.Ya. Lurie and M.E. Sergeenko) in the second half of 1944 and their discussions testify to a certain freedom of scientists from ideological control, their distancing from discussions on the use of the MarxistLeninist heritage in the study of antiquity, their consideration of issues not peculiar to the Soviet historiography of the 1930s. Implicit in the findings is a hope for democratisation of the political order. The activity of the LOII staff in perpetuating the memory of academician S.A. Zhebelev reveals their orientation to the connection with pre-revolutionary traditions, including a strictly scientific approach.

DE Harry Harrison; history of ideas; intellectual history; "Eden" cycle;

AB The author analyses the role of science fiction literature as one of the dimensions of intellectual history in the development of American right-wing political movements in the second half of the 1980s. It is assumed that the right-wing political discourse during this period fell in ideological and cultural crisis. The crisis stimulated processes of changing the spatial localisation of right-wing sentiments from the political sphere towards cultural activities. The author believes that in the context of the rising popularity of left-wing and liberal trends in the USA political and intellectual spaces, the vectors of visualisation of right-wing conservative ideas shifted to literature, including science fiction. Prose of the American writer Harry Harrison of the 1980s. is analysed as an episode in the intellectual history and history of ideas of the USA right-wing political thought. The author believes that Harrison's novels of "Eden" cycle actualise the inclusion and involvement of the USA writers in transformation of right-wing discourse. The author analyses how Harrison, with his formally literary alternative history project, promoted political ideas of American far right, which allows for an expanded interpretation of his texts not only as an episode in the history of the USA literature, but also as an important segment of the cultural and intellectual history of the right politics. It is assumed that the novels of the cycle were attempts to actualise the collective phobias of right-wing intellectuals towards collectivism, as well as feminism and environmentalism also. The author analyses how Harrison in his novels developed images of the Other, legitimising the international confrontation between two ideological political systems. It is assumed that Harrison became one of the first American intellectuals who tried to legitimise anti-feminist and anti-ecological phobias in the political consciousness of the USA.

ID SENSE
AB Analytical realism is a new epistemological conception which developed in the context of analytic philosophy. The term "analytical realism" is already used in Russian philosophy of the past decades. A. F. Gryaznov began to speak about it. After that L.B. Makeeva in her monograph Language, Ontology and Realism used this term too. However, these research works had mainly a historical character. Some known thinkers and their ideas in the areas of semantics, ontology, epistemology, and logic in the context of analytic philosophy were thought here. The authors of this article use the term "analytical realism" in the context of systematic philosophy in order to denote their own conceptual development in epistemology. Analytical realism asserts a possibility of true knowledge of objective reality.This knowledge is thought as a fixation of senses and referents of linguistic expressions and true values of sentences since the language is a fundamental area of experience in the context of analytic philosophy. The authors separate two aspects of analytical realism: formal (logical) and substantial (semantic). In the formal aspect, epistemological theories of antirealistic (skeptical, relativistic) type are criticized by demonstrating the logical inconsistency of these conceptions. The criticism is realized with the help of the reductio ad absurdum argument that is based on the phenomenon of self- reference. The authors demonstrate that theoretical developments of antirealistic type turn out to be contradictory in the moment when the basis theses of these theories are applied to themselves. However, the formal aspect is insufficient for the development of realism. Realism should be founded not only in the formal aspect by demonstrating the contradiction of the opposite position but also in the direct mode through the exhibition of truth of realistic position. The substantive aspect of analytical realism must do it. Since analytical realism is a conception within analytic philosophy, then its substantive aspect assumes the reality of meanings (senses) of linguistic expression and a possibility of a true knowledge of them. All questions of knowledge are considered as questions of knowledge of meanings of linguistic expressions treated as stable essences in contrast to skepticism and relativism in analytic philosophy, in particular, the skepticism of late Ludwig Wittgenstein, which denied meaning as a stable structure. A detailed development of the substantive aspect of analytical realism is presented in the article.

ID INVESTMENT; CONTEXT; VALUES
AB According to representative all- Russian surveys of the Institute of Sociology of the Federal Scientific Research Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the 2000-2020s two problems are explored: whether over the last "crisis" decade there has been an increase in institutional trust as social capital, or its reduction, and also to what extent institutional trust is really a resource in Russia today that brings additional benefits. With regard to trust in state institutions, the impulse to "unite around the flag" associated with the beginning of the Special Military Operation continued to operate in 2024, although with weakening force; it overlapped with the rise of institutional trust indicators that began in 2021, interrupting their decline in 2016-2020. The hierarchy of objects of trust was constantly headed by the President and the Russian army, which in recent years were trusted by almost 4/5 of Russians. At the same time, Russians more often did not trust political institutions not related to the "vertical of power," although the general trend of the 2020s featured increasing confidence to them. Trust in political institutions clearly shows a "comeback": Russians with higher institutional trust (in particular, in the President) more often took social actions that contributed to the stability of the situation in the country (in particular, they more often participated in the 2024 presidential elections), more often with they perceived the country's development path with optimism and were less likely to experience negative social feelings (for example, that "we can't live like this any longer").

AB In the article for the first time in Russian historical science, using history reconstruction, the author evaluates the experience of the secret service work of employees of the Finnish Gendarme Department on the territory of The Grand Duchy of Finland. The source base of the study was previously unknown documents of the Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Empire, the Headquarters of the Separate Gendarme Corps and the Finnish Gendarme Department, which are stored in the State Archives of the Russian Federation. Particular attention is paid to the previously unknown activities of provisional political investigative institutions established on the territory of the Grand Duchy of Finland - the Vyborg Security Department and the Finnish Investigative Agency. The number and quality of the secret agents of the Finnish Gendarme Department, the content of the reports of the heads of the Finnish Gendarme Department to the Police Department and the reaction of the directors of the Police Department to the information provided by the former about the revolutionary movement in Finland are analyzed. The intradepartmental claims and accusations against the Finnish Gendarme Department of unprofessionalism, forgery and falsification of intelligence data are evaluated. It is concluded that at the beginning of the 20th century, the activities of the heads of the Finnish Gendarme department led, with rare exceptions, to the complete collapse of intelligence work and caused the formation of a falsification industry of secret employees' messages. In the context of planning government events in Finland, the information coming from the gendarmes serving on the Finnish territory was not only useless, it was even harmful, since it was based on fi ctitious data.

ID BUSINESS DIPLOMACY
AB In today's world, there is a close intertwining of academic disciplines and spheres of practical interaction. To identify a potential for transfer of international practices, the authors of this study attempt to elicit cases of successful transfer of practical experience from International Relations and world politics to other fields, as well as provide illustrative examples of parallel development of similar practices. As one of the most extensive practices in the realm of International Relations, diplomacy appears to contain a large number of relevant cases. Transfer and parallel development of negotiation techniques and mediation technologies manifest themselves both in the related sphere of domestic politics and in corporate culture. Another example of business borrowing international practices is the institution of industrial espionage, which nowadays might be compared to the institution of political-military espionage in terms of its scale and organization. The study also focuses on the phenomena of parallel development of social practices, namely emancipation. While it is regarded as a process of gaining legal independence in the sphere of law, in International Relations it denotes a rejection of the idea of domination of a certain order or ideological stance. The final part of the study is dedicated to the consideration of typologies of behavior, as well as analogies and metaphors, in various social spheres. Metaphors and analogies unite such seemingly distant disciplines as International Relations and folklore studies. In addition to allusions to foreign policy events, which appear with a certain frequency in mass culture, the authors also present possible parallels between the structure of fairy tales and that of political conflict. On the grounds of the case studies, the paper highlights the diversity of areas of international engagement that have directly or indirectly contributed, or could contribute, to the emergence and/or development of other practice areas.

AB Interest in artificial intelligence and specifically in neural networks is not declining in society, but there is a noticeable change in the emphasis that attracts the attention of Russians. Mass availability and vast opportunities initially gave rise to fears about the displacement of 'live' labour force from the labour market and mass replacement by artificial intelligence in all easily algorithmised industries. Changes in the labour market have indeed occurred, but these changes, as well as user experimentation with neural networks, have brought new concerns to the forefront. Based on data from the annual monitoring of permanent and current socio- political indicators conducted by the Institute of Socio- Political Research of FCTAS RAS, as well as other available generative artificial intelligence research, the authors trace the social sentiment associated with the mass adoption and use of artificial intelligence and neural networks. Data from June 2024 shows that concerns about employment have been replaced by fears about the penetration of digital reality into social reality in the form of misinformation, scams, spoofs and dipfakes. The change in the information agenda has not reduced the level of citizens' anxiety and requires attention from researchers.

DT Article
DE philosophy of politics; political philosophy; political science;
   ontology; metaphysics; philosophy; science
AB The article attempts to provide a definition for the problem area of the philosophy of politics, political philosophy and political science. Given the lack of a well-established distinction between the subjects of these sciences in the Russian-language discourse, the author turns to the English-language tradition. The analysis of this discourse shows the following: 1) the absence of a distinction between political philosophy and the philosophy of politics, which is replaced by political ontology as part of political philosophy; 2) the existence of a distinction between political theory and political philosophy; 3) the dependence of the paradigm of the relationship between political theory and political philosophy on the consensus developed in the national intellectual tradition. In the English-language discourse, the question of the relationship between political science and political philosophy comes to the fore. The latter is considered as a subordinate, integral part of political science. It is shown that, based on the criterion of "insufficient scientificity", attempts to exclude political philosophy from the political science do not stop. The article substantiates the position according to which, despite their apparent similarity, the subjects of political science and political philosophy do not coincide - the disciplinary ontology of political science can become the subject of political philosophy. When discussing the relationship between the philosophy of politics and political philosophy, the article presents several hypotheses. First, a distinction is made between the philosophy of politics and political philosophy and the author argues that they are distinct. Secondly, the position, according to which the philosophy of politics belongs to the field of philosophy, and political philosophy to political science, is critically examined, and the fact that the two disciplines belong to the philosophical corpus of knowledge is substantiated. Thirdly, it is proposed to demarcate between the philosophy of politics and political philosophy in accordance with the difference between their subjects. The subject of philosophy of politics is the phenomenon of the political, while the subject of political philosophy is political phenomena.

AB The article expounds how the international doctrine of human rights originated historically and substantially from the European intellectual traditions; nonetheless the origins of the doctrine do not impede the universalization of human rights as worldwide general standards for states and societies of different social, political, cultural, and religious types. The problem of the universality of human rights goes far beyond doctrinal issues: international human rights pretend to regulate internal relations and interstate interactions as a principle of international law, but the variety of political systems question drastically the possibility and appropriateness of such a universality. For the research the following method were employed: comparative and formal legal analysis, historical studies, deconstruction, critical approaches in law, posthumanistic apparatus. The author argues that the invention and development of the universal human rights relate both to the adoption of the fundamental legal documents and the apprehension of the tragedies of the world wars and totalitarianism.During the UN period the international human rights standards dominated the dynamics of the international law and significantly influenced its stricture and substance.For conclusion the author puts that the universality of human rights is not their descriptive feature but a normative claim. The latter is strengthened by instrumentalization of human rights as a general form of international legal discourse. Being such a form human rights are attributed to non-human beings to ensure their international legal protection - to artificial legal persons, fauna, flora, nature as a whole.

AB This article presents an analysis of strategies used for the legal regulation of digital transformation processes at the municipal level in the BRICS countries. A systematic analysis of modern trends in the legal regulation of digital transformation in Brazil, South Africa, India and China was carried out, and the features and general directions of this process were highlighted. The authors noted a variety of different approaches to normalizing digital processes in management, ranging from fixing basic principles at the constitutional level to developing "flexible" regulation constitutionally mandated through by-laws and state political and legal documents. It is shown that the digitalization of public administration is primarily focused on the level of national government, since financial resources are specifically concentrated at the highest level of governance. It is concluded that the specificity of local government, manifested in a high degree of self-government and participation of the population in solving life support issues, objectively requires a shift in the emphasis of digitalization to the local level of government. It has been proven that this process requires strategic state planning on the part of the state for the digitalization of local self-government, taking into account the elimination of the "digital divide" in municipalities. The authors propose the implementation and development of the "smart city" concept in the municipalities.

The article analyzes both a huge layer of transcripts of twenty-two meetings and polemical materials exchanged between the delegations. The key intrigue is shown - the emerging split between representatives of the Communist Parties of China and Albania, on the one hand, and the CPSU and most other Communist parties, on the other. The tactics of Khrushchev and other heads of delegations in overcoming the split are analyzed. The final joint adoption of the Statement and the anti-war Appeal to the peoples of the whole world was the result of a compromise between the Soviet and Chinese delegations and, ultimately, a temporary victory for the CPSU, which prevented the radicalization of key documents and achieved a demonstration of the unity of the ranks of the world communist movement in 1960.

DE meta-argumentation; logical and cognitive theory of argumentation;
   algorithm of search and selection of dispute resolutions
AB In 2019, Igor Vladimirovich Berestov, discussing the historical and philosophical dispute between contextualists and appropriationists about the compatibility of the historicity of ancient texts with their contemporary reading, formulated the task of objectifying the discussion. He saw the core challenge of this task in generating a new point of view that would unite the claims none of which had gained the upper hand in the previous discussion despite the fact that all of the arguments had been supported by arguments and attacked by counter-arguments due to what the discussion had reached a dead end. That new point of view would reemploy the relationships of support and refutation among the arguments and thereby bring the discussion out of the impasse, avoiding the inconsistency generated by a unification of the position due to which logicians call an explosion, when any conclusion follows from a contradiction. Both approaches to its solution considered by Berestov (DefLog and ArguMed by Bart Verheij and the logical- cognitive theory of argumentation by Elena Lisanyuk) were not free from restrictions. In the article, I propose a solution to the problem of objectifying the discussion with the help of an algorithm for searching and selecting resolutions to disputes, based on the logical-cognitive theory of argumentation. It consists in reducing the objectification to the subset of the arguments of the dispute that makes up its resolution. In the article, the dispute between contextualists and appropriationists described by Berestov is reconstructed and visualized using OVA application. It enables us to see that in single mixed disputes that allow compromise there always exists a resolution formed by the preferred, or maximal admissible, extension of the set of arguments of the dispute. In contrast, in complex mixed disputes that allow no compromise the solution formed by a grounded, or minimal complete admissible, extension, consists of the strongest defended arguments of the dispute, or in their absence may be empty and indicate the fixed point in the dispute. This means that any single mixed dispute can be objectified, in contrast to complex mixed disputes, which are not always amenable to objectification.

AB This article characterizes the influence of the crisis in relations with the Russian Federation on the state of the nuclear energy sector of the European Union. The author considers the climatic role of low-carbon nuclear power in the energy transition, energy security issues, and the level of dependence on Russian supplies and technologies, as well as the problem of anti-Russian nuclear sanctions. Despite the fact that only 12 member states have their own nuclear power plants, the issue of nuclear energy is a rather acute one for the EU with many contradictions among its member states. There are debates both on the justification of the transitional role in general and on the possibility of further co-operation with Russia in particular. For example, Germany has closed its last NPPs, Lithuania insists on anti-Russian sanctions, France intends to expand its nuclear power infrastructure, and Hungary has no plans to give up either supplies or joint projects. At the same time, not all owners of Soviet/Russian VVER reactors share the position of the latter. Some of them seek comprehensive diversification. These countries are the most vulnerable, as they depend not only on nuclear power in general, but also on fuel supplies and Russian technologies in particular. This differentiation in views casts doubt on the possibility of a full-fledged nuclear embargo. Moreover, according to Euratom, due to the desire to increase crisis stocks for a number of components and Rosatom's unique ability to work on each stage of the nuclear fuel cycle, in some directions supplies from Russia have only increased.

AB The dynamics of the financial market depends on the expectations of investors, which are largely determined by economic and political events. To form investment strategies, it is important to understand which events described in the news may affect changes in the value of assets. The purpose of this work is to identify the topics of political news that affect the profitability of shares of Russian companies, and to compare the predictive power of news from Russian and foreign sources. This study investigates the relationship between political news about Russia, obtained from domestic ("Interfax") and foreign ("New York Times") sources, and the stock returns of 193 Russian companies over the period from September 1, 2021 to August 31, 2023. There were 30 political dictionaries from each source identified using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, and the differences in the highlighted political themes were noted. Time-series models were used to test hypotheses about the impact of political news on the stock prices of Russian companies. The study demonstrates that the Russian stock market's dynamics are impacted by news from various sources. Specifically, political dictionaries derived from foreign sources enhance the return predictions for the stocks of 142 Russian companies, whereas those from domestic sources improve the forecasts for 146 ones. Nevertheless, models incorporating political news from domestic sources yield higher-quality return forecasts. Additionally, using the Random Forest algorithm, it is demonstrated that the domestic media's interpretation of events, which are covered in both Russian and foreign news, exerts a more substantial influence on the domestic stock market. Furthermore, models that integrate political dictionaries from both sources exhibit superior quality compared to those that rely on news from a single source. Based on the results obtained, it is demonstrated that incorporating political news into investment decisions enables investors to construct stock portfolios with higher returns.

AB This article focuses on the socio-political life during the terms of the II, III, and IV State Dumas, specifically examining the career and kinship connections within the "Stolypin administration" and the deputy corps. The study covers the period from April 26, 1906, to September 5, 1911, when P. A. Stolypin held the position of Minister of Internal Affairs. It also explores the period from the election of the II Duma on February 20, 1907, to the election of the IV Duma on November 15, 1912, to identify former or future governors or vice-governors among the deputies of the Stolypin era. The geographical scope of the study includes the provinces of European Russia. The authors aim to analyze the relationship between bureaucratic and political elites during the Stolypin era. The article examines the career biographies and factional affiliations of Stolypin administrators connected to the Duma, as well as the kinship ties between the governor corps and Duma deputies. The authors conclude that provincial administrators were predominantly associated with the Union of October 17 and right-wing factions, with most not seeking to pursue parliamentary careers. Typically, these were public figures who had previously held positions in local government and nobility self-government before serving in provincial administration.

We support the hypothesis that the links between the parties were permanently affected by ambivalent assessments, very typical of the ideological reductionism of the Cold War period. The absence of fluidity and mutual understanding would harm the possibilities of a fruitful understanding that would have favored the Chilean Road to Socialism project itself.

TI Embarking on Friendship: Exploring Early Soviet-Indian Relations

LA Russian
DT Article
DE USSR; India; bilateral relations; information base; Bos; mythology;
   Stalin; Germany; Japan; World War II
AB By the onset of the Second World War, the USSR had virtually no experience or established traditions of interaction with South Asian countries. Initially, Soviet-Indian relations could be characterized as tepid, largely due to a lack of accurate information about each other. During the wartime, the USSR underestimated the advantages of forging close ties with Indian left-wing centrists, favoring instead communists who provided the Kremlin with falsified data on the national liberation movement in the country. The article examines how bilateral relations evolved and strengthened as mutual knowledge grew. The second stage of Soviet-Indian relations (1955-1971) can be termed as a period of "birth of friendship," as the image of partnership is consolidated in the eyes of Soviet and Indian politicians and the public. Soviet diplomacy played a pivotal role in shaping policy changes: diplomats sought to gather crucial information about events in the country, transmit it to the USSR, and promote bilateral rapprochement, sometimes even acting in violation of instructions. The article pays particular attention to the activities of Subhas Chandra Bose, the leader of the left wing of the Indian National Congress, who according to Indian sociological surveys on the most prominent politicians of the 20th century, ranks second only to Mahatma Gandhi. During the Second World War, he was an uncompromising fighter against British colonialists. The Soviet Union did not pay sufficient attention to S.C. Bose, although he potentially could have been a valuable partner for Moscow. At present, the problem of mutual lack of awareness has resurfaced, hindering the development of closer political, economic, and cultural-humanitarian ties between Russia and India.

AB This article examines the impact of large language models (LLMs) on contemporary public discourse, analyzing the social and epistemological implications of their implementation. The study is structured around two key questions: the possibility of realizing higher mental functions in artificial social agents and the influence of these agents on human society. The first part of the article analyzes the potential of LLMs in the context of theories of consciousness and understanding. It explores the neurophilosophical approach, the quantum consciousness theory, and the concept of enactivism as applied to artificial intelligence. A rethinking of traditional notions about the nature of understanding and cognitive processes is proposed. The second part analyzes the influence of LLMs on social reality. It discusses the role of LLMs in transforming the public sphere and changing the structure of power and knowledge. Ethical and existential challenges associated with the integration of LLMs into society are considered. The conclusion emphasizes the need to develop a new form of "digital hermeneutics" and to rethink the concepts of authorship, originality, and creativity in the context of AI. The importance of an interdisciplinary approach to solving problems arising at the intersection of technology and society is noted. The article calls for researchers' active participation in shaping a future where artificial intelligence serves the goals of human development while preserving humanistic values and ideals.

AB The study analyzes the impact of big data-based Large language models (LLMs) on public discourse, having previously considered the principles of functioning and the possibilities for understanding natural language by these models. It is determined that LLMs, having the abilities of deep information processing, contextual understanding and self-learning, act as new social actors in the information society. These models play a key role in the creation, analysis and dissemination of content, contributing to the development of new forms of communication. They are actively used in social networks, SMM, journalism and other fields to moderate content, aggregate news and create personal recommendations. However, the accelerated generation of information leads to an information overload and the emergence of ethical issues related to the accuracy and impartiality of materials. The study notes that LLMs enrich public discourse while simultaneously creating new ethical dilemmas related to authorship and reliability of information. The Internet and LLM have a significant impact on public discussion, the structure of knowledge and the processes of knowledge acquisition. The emergence of mixed human-AI communities generates both new forms of social interaction and raises questions about information verification and critical analysis of sources. From epistemological point of view, new approaches to understanding and processing knowledge are required today. In the field of linguophilosophy and cognitive sciences, LLMs provide new perspectives for the study of language, consciousness and cognition, especially in the context of human interaction with machine-generated content. The development and wide spread of LLMs indicate profound changes in the social order, so that large language models acquire the property of social agency. This requires all participants in the information society to take a responsible approach to the use and development of such technologies.

AB Introduction. In the 17(th) century, in the south of European Russia, in the Black Earth districts, the process of economic development of vast fertile lands took place. The effectiveness of this process was associated with the increase in the number of Russian settlers to work on arable land. Economic success played an important role in the confrontation between Russia and the Crimean Khanate. The war between the two states lasted throughout the 17(th) century. In recent decades, the study of the history of the development of black earth districts in Russia has continued in various directions, but the problem of economic development of new territories remains relevant for study. Methods and materials. The authors of the article use data on the number of villages as a criterion for assessing the process of reclamation of empty lands. The authors focus on the villages of the three largest regions of the Black Earth region - the Belgorod, Voronezh, and Yelets regions. Materials from the Kozlov region are used as additional information. The materials for the work were mass sources - census books of the 17(th) - first quarter of the 18th centuries. Results. As a result of the study, an increase in the number of rural settlements and changes in their internal structure were recorded in favor of the increase in large villages. All this testifies to Russia's economic success in the region and allows us to understand some of the features of this process. There is also no doubt about the steady demographic growth throughout the 17(th )century. These factors played an important role in the struggle for the annexation of the Black Earth Strip to Russia during periodically escalating military conflicts and political confrontations.

AB Introduction. In the Orthodox Nicholas Church in Vilna since the 1860s, there were icons brought from St. Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg. The reasons, mechanisms, and socio-political context of the transportation of the icons from the capital of the Russian Empire to the Northwestern Krai after the uprising of 1863 were not clear. The purpose of this article is to analyze the complex of archival and published sources and reconstruct the history of sending the icons of St. Isaac's Cathedral to Vilna, to identify the factors that accompanied this process and to determine the circle of its participants. Methods and materials. The article is based on the archival sources from the funds of the Russian State Historical Archive (f. 472 "Chancery of the Ministry of the Imperial Court," f. 502 "Cabinet of the Architect Montferrand," f. 789 "Imperial Academy of Arts," f. 1311 "Commission of the construction of St. Isaac's Cathedral"). The study of archival sources and synchronous sources of personal origin and historiography made it possible to reconstruct the motives, the course, and stages of the transportation of icons from St. Isaac's Cathedral to Vilna churches. Analysis. The solicitation of the Vilna Governor-General M.N. Muravyev about sending to Vilna the picturesque icons replaced by mosaics in St. Isaac's Cathedral was caused both by his desire for economy and the speedy filling of Vilna churches by Orthodox icons and, apparently, by the very correspondence of the icons (depicting saints whose names coincided with the names of members of the Romanov dynasty) to his own political course aimed at imperial integration and the symbolic conquest of the space of the Northwestern Krai. Results. M.N. Muravyev's successor, the Governor-General K.P. Kaufman, who perhaps knew about the symbolic unity of Orthodoxy and the monarchy, reflected in the icons of St. Isaac's Cathedral, made a similar request to the Ministry of the Imperial Court to send the additional icons. However, Alexander II was a supporter of a softer political course in relation to the Northwestern Krai and did not consider the icons of St. Isaac's Cathedral as an instrument of symbolic and confessional politics, and the practice of sending the icons from Petersburg to Vilna was finished. Funding. The research was supported by the Russian Science Foundation, project No 21-48-04402 "Saints and heroes from Christianization to Nationalism: Symbol, Image, Memory (Nord- West Russia, Baltic and Nordic countries)".

Khrushchev from his posts, the state of Soviet-Chinese relations, and the situation in the world communist movement. They are contained in the pages of his diary, part of which, with the permission of his son, Marco Di Piazza, is reproduced in this publication. The materials of the "Diary" are supplemented by three other documentary materials: these are the speeches of the authors of this publication- R. Alonzi and V. P. Lubin at the September 2021 celebrations in San Gimignano in honor of the centenary of its famous resident, honorary citizen of this city F. De Piazza, as well as a private letter from Marco Di Piazza to V. P. Lubin, explaining the idea of the full publication of the "Diary" and adding important touches to the portrait of his father. The very way of thinking of Francesco Di Piazza, his interesting and very accurate assessments of life in the USSR, which was perceived by representatives of the left in the mid-twentieth century as a stronghold of socialism, and which many of them oriented themselves to in their political and social activities in their countries, represent important documentary evidence and confirmation of the fact that the developments in the Soviet Union were closely followed in the world, especially among leftists sympathetic to it.

AB This article examines the role and significance of the "Hungarian factor" in the central and eastern European political landscape of France during the period from April to August 1920. The novelty of this research lies in its analysis not only of the bilateral Franco-Hungarian interactions but also of how Paris's perceptions of Hungary's place in Europe were intertwined with other vectors of the Third Republic's foreign policy. The study utilizes published French diplomatic documents, the diary of General Edmond Buat, Chief of Staff of the French Army, and select reports from General Artus de la Panouse, the French military attach & eacute; in the United Kingdom. The author concludes that the "Hungarian factor" influenced the central and eastern European policy of the Third Republic in a contradictory manner. It is demonstrated that France's view of Hungary as a defeated nation served Paris's objectives of affirming its status as a victorious power, consolidating a belt of friendly states in Central-Eastern Europe, and expanding its financial and economic presence. At the same time, it is emphasized that Hungary was not perceived as a direct threat to the interests of the Third Republic; rather, in the context of the Red Army's advance westward, it could potentially be integrated into an anti-Soviet coalition.

AB Introduction. The adaptation mechanism of the state as apolitical institution determines the vectors of transformation of social interactions in the event of significant external and internal crises. Overcoming the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the conduct of a special military operation by Russia in Ukraine leads to the formation of a new system of relations between the government and society, when the growth of trust in political institutions leads to the "shift" of local problems to the federal national level. Methods and materials. The methodological basis of the study is the theory of collective identity and individual provisions of the theory of rational choice. The empirical basis of the study is public opinion polls on the practices and forms of civic engagement, conducted by the largest domestic sociological centers. Specific research methods are statistical analysis of posts in Telegram, visualization by constructing a boxplot, and a histogram of the distribution of reactions to posts. An analysis of the forms and practices of civic engagement of young people in the Russian Federation during the COVID-19 and military operation periods showed that as a result of the increase in the level of political, institutional, and generalized trust in Russia, a number ofvectors have been formed, the direction of which is dictated by the special military operation. Results. If the trend towards online, inclusivity, and locality is characteristic of civic engagement in countries that are not going through the crisis stage, then in Russia 2022-2024 the focus is determined by the mechanism of "civic mobilization," which is characterized by 1) digitalization; 2) a temporary shift in the scale of actions from the local to the federal level; and 3) a general increase in civic engagement among young people.

DT Article
DE personalistic socialism; personalism; criticism of socialism; Berdyaev;
   social philosophy
AB The article examines the attitude of Nikolai Aleksandrovich Berdyaev (1874-1948) to the main features of socialism and his criticism of the weaknesses of the socialist social order (the idea of equality, ineffective work ethic, chiliastic sentiments, profanation of Christian values, etc.). It is noted that Berdyaev is undoubtedly a socialist-oriented thinker, and his critical attitude towards the forms of socialist manifestation is associated with the fact that Berdyaev had his own vision of the "target" state of the socialist system, that may be called "personalistic socialism". The article examines the main features of personalistic socialism proposed by Berdyaev: justification of inequality and defense of the principle of hierarchism, protection of personal freedom, proper attitude towards work (labor as service to one's neighbor, as the revelation of the creative potential), "new economic psychology", and, in contrast to already embodied forms of socialism, Berdyaev declares, that the goal of personalistic socialism is the creation of a classless society. The third part of the article attempts to reconstruct Berdyaev's "social-philosophical dream", while substantiating the philosopher's lack of ambition for political action and the creation of a political project of personalistic socialism. In order to reconstruct the ideas of Berdyaev, the author uses texts from different periods of his work: "New Religious Consciousness and Society" (1907), "Philosophy of Inequality" (1918), "Self- Knowledge" (1949), as well as articles from the 1930s: "On Social Personalism (1933), "Personalism and Marxism" (1935), "On modern nationalism" (1938), etc.

AB The article examines and analyzes a set of archival documents of the State Committee for Nature Protection of the USSR ( Goskomprirody of the USSR), which covers the events and processes that occurred in the relationship between the Soviet state, society and nature at the turn of the 1980s-1990s. In the domestic historiography this subject is still poorly studied, so the main source on the environmental history of the perestroika period are archival documents. The most informative in this respect are the materials of the USSR Goskompriroda, which are stored in the fonds of the Ministry of Nature Management and Environmental Protection of the USSR (F. 709) of the Russian State Archive of Economics ( RSAE). The purpose of the study, the results of which are presented in the article, is to analyze the structure of this fund, which consists of 661 storage units, and to review the content of its inventories. The materials in them are grouped by dates and belonging to the structural subdivisions of the State Committee. The main part of them (599 items) is concentrated in inventory 1. The chronological framework of the complex of documents of the USSR State Committee for Nature Protection is limited to four years (1988-1991), during which the socio-economic and political situation in the country changed significantly. There have been changes in the content and directions of development of the state environmental policy, the essence of which is reflected in the materials of the agency that formally managed the entire system of nature management and environmental protection in the USSR during the perestroika period. These include: official and office records of the USSR State Committee for Nature Protection, its correspondence with central and regional authorities; parliamentary requests and answers to them; materials of the state environmental expertise; information on activities to promote environmental knowledge; statistical data; documents on international cooperation with foreign organizations on environmental issues; reports on the work of the USSR reserves, and much more. For specialists in the environmental and social history of Russia in the Soviet period, the most valuable are the storage units containing letters from citizens and public organizations addressed both to the chairman of the USSR State Committee for Nature Protection and to the highest authorities. They contain appeals, proposals and requests, and characterize the environmental situation in various regions of the country. The study of these letters, as well as the documents testifying to the response to them on the part of state bodies, allows us to analyze the level of development of environmental consciousness of the country's population and the peculiarities of relations between the authorities and society in the field of nature protection. The documents of the USSR Goskompriroda represent an extensive and diverse source base for studying the environmental history of Russia in the Soviet period. Their further research and introduction into scientific turnover will contribute to the development of this branch of historical science.

AB The place and role of values in scientific knowledge in general and in sociology in particular are discussed in the above paper. Values in the light of political sociology (political- ideological values) are compared with values themselves, which in the light of the sociology of knowledge appear as phenomenologically revealed initial givens. They form a core of the worldviews and worldview of each person as an individual. In the interpretation of values themselves, the author relies on his interpretation of the religious and philosophical axiology of M. Scheler. The author proves that, although all kinds of evaluativeness are subject to exclusion, "value neutrality" in social cognition is impossible in principle, therefore it is necessary to strive for its explication and articulation. The author questions the possibility of scientific- discursive knowledge of values, as well as respective attempts to study value consciousness empirically.

SO PRAVOPRIMENENIE-LAW ENFORCEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Law; culture; legal co-creation; cooperation; legal culture; political;
   law-making; culture of; law-making and law enforcement
AB The subject of the research is the institute of legal co-creation of public authorities and civil society as a practical expression of the joint activities of subjects of state-legal relations aimed at the creation and constructive transformation of the legal form of public relations, carried out primarily within the framework of law-making activities of the state, as well as during the practical implementation of law (within the framework of law enforcement processes) in connection with the phenomenon of culture society and its legal culture. The stable interrelation of legal co-creation and culture in the state is revealed, in which there is a mutually beneficial positive influence of culture on the effectiveness of mechanisms of legal co-creation and legal co-creation on culture. The purpose of the research is to establish and substantiate aspects of the interrelation and mutual influence of the phenomenon of legal co-creation of public authorities and civil society and the culture of society (legal culture as its variety), the formation and development of theoretical positions in the plane of the ongoing study (research) of the phenomenon of legal co-creation. Methodology. The interdisciplinary approach serves as the basic methodological basis, which provides a synthesis of methodological tools of jurisprudence (formal legal, instrumental legal, etc. approaches) and methodological techniques and achievements of related socio-humanitarian fields of knowledge (cultural studies, sociology, psychology, political science, etc.), which allows a comprehensive and in-depth study of the phenomenon of legal co-creation as a complex social and legal phenomenon. The main results. In the course of the research, it is proved that legal co-creation is a necessary resource in the legal system of the state, conditioned by the culture of society, which allows achieving higher-quality and socially adequate law-making and law enforcement results (decisions). Scientific theses are proposed to develop the theoretical foundations of the problem of legal co-creation. It is noted that legal co-creation is an indicator of a high level of social and legal culture. The opposite positive influence of legal co-creation on culture in the state in general and legal culture in particular is also stated. The theoretical and practical aspects of the interrelation and mutual influence of legal co-creation and culture are characterized. Conclusions. Legal co-creation and culture are very closely interrelated and mutually influence each other. On the one hand, culture creates conditions for better and more effective legal co-creation of public authorities and civil society institutions. Moreover, it contributes to the formation of a special culture of legal co-creation, which in many ways acts as a special kind of culture of law-making in general, but also manifests itself noticeably in the processes of legal realization (where, among other things, it is required to involve active creative dialogical principles to solve issues related to the application of law), accordingly increasing the level of culture of legal realization. On the other hand, legal co-creation provides strategic and tactical "regulatory and legal services" to the culture of society, including a cross-section of legal culture, contributes to raising its level through legal means expressed both in federal laws and other regulatory legal acts, and within the framework of various types of state legal policy.

DT Article
DE Japan; foodscape; food culture; food sovereignty; globalization;
   culinary soft power; washoku
ID FOOD SOVEREIGNTY; GOVERNANCE; SYSTEM
AB The article focuses on the concept of foodscape, which is relatively new to the Russian academic community. In the theoretical and methodological part of the work, the authors deconstruct the term "foodscape," identify the epistemological foundations and the conceptual roots of the concept. For the first time in world science, the concept of foodscape is compared with related semantic complexes in accordance with the theory of the "culinary triangle," which was developed by C. Levi-Strauss. Using the method of scientific visualization and comparative analysis, a model of the taxonomic hierarchy of the foodscape is constructed, which symbolizes the symbiotic relationship between nature and culture, registered with the help of an innovative author's classification - at the global, national, and local levels. The practical part of the article is devoted to the study of the transformation process of the foodscape of Japan, characterized by balancing between gastronomy and gastro-anomie. It is proved that, along with the import of foreign food products, which undermined the food self-sufficiency of the state, the patterns of the Euro-American civilization were imported, which modified the model of social behavior, ingrained eating habits, and age-old culinary foundations of Japanese society. As empirical evidence, the authors present and analyze successful marketing strategies of multinational corporations that focus on monetization of cultural and household rituals, commodification of traditions, and consumerization of ancient religious rituals. In addition, the authors reveal the powerful protectionist potential of the washoku as traditional food culture of Japan. It has been found that the washoku's ideological module was flexibly converted by the modern Japanese government, both for domestic and foreign policy of the state. Nowadays, washoku is the institutional foundation for a specialized legislative act regulating the procedure of Re-McDonaldization of the population. Along with this, washoku is also an effective tool of soft gastronomic power and gastrodiplomacy, creating a charming image of Japan in the eye of the beholder (the international political community). In conclusion, the authors diagnose the dialectical nature of the process of Kawaii-fication of Japan's foodscape, characterized by the charm of infantilism with a grain of salt - radical escapism and social maladjustment.

AB Modern science research proceeds from the importance of studying social interaction between scientists to determine the effectiveness of research teams and form an idea of the structural changes necessary to increase their competitiveness. The community of Russian sociologists is characterized by weak integration into foreign sociological science and selective representation of researchers in the world scientific discourse due to the peculiarities of its formation, as well as disintegration at the local level due to the high level of centralization and inequality between the capital cities and regions in modern Russia. This study is aimed at studying collaborative networks in the scientific community of Russian sociologists in the period from 2010 to 2019. The main method of data analysis is the bibliometric network analysis of publications, which is a special case of applying the social network analysis methodology. The article presents a general methodological approach to the analysis of collaborative networks of Russian authors, which includes the formation of a bibliographic data base, the construction of collaborative networks, and a description of the network analysis strategy for studying collaboration in the community of Russian sociologists. The proposed approach is tested based on the analysis of data on the participation of Russian sociologists in conferences of the international sociological associations ESA and ISA in 2010-2019 and can be used for further analysis of publications of Russian sociologists. The results showed many unrelated groups of authors at the local level. At the same time, the links between the authors are well expressed at the level of organizations; there is a high level of geographical centralization and the dominance of three main institutions - the Russian Academy of Sciences, the National Research University Higher School of Economics and Saint Petersburg State University. This confirms the initial assumptions and actualizes the research questions of the study. The next step in the development of the methodology is the description of a workflow using specific tools and algorithms for collecting, processing, and analyzing data from Russian-language publications. In addition to the substantive interest, the scientific novelty and practical significance of the project lies in the development of an integrated methodological approach for the analysis of bibliographic data in Russian.

AB The article is examining the interaction between the Soviet and U.S. academic schools in the study of Latin America. Latin American studies had a much longer history in the USA than in the USSR, but after the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the pace of development of this discipline in both countries roughly equalized. Through the efforts of the director of the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Pittsburgh Cole Blasier and the director of the Institute of Latin America of the USSR Academy of Sciences Viktor Vatslavovich Volsky, in 1980 cooperation was formalized in the form of an agreement between the Latin American Studies Association (LASA) and the USSR Academy of Sciences on scientific exchange in the form of holding joint symposia on current issues of regional development (1981-1984, 1986). During the conferences, which took place on a rotation basis in the USSR and the USA, key issues of the history of Latin American countries, their economy, social structure and political institutions, and their place in the system of international relations were discussed. This format played a major role in mutual familiarization with the research methodology of the Soviet and North American schools of Latin American studies, and the exchange of scientific publications. At the same time, it is revealed that both the USSR and the USA attached high political significance to these contacts. It is demonstrated that the Soviet and American participants in the exchange sometimes acted as unofficial mediators between their governments. In the context of a short-term aggravation of contradictions between the USSR and the USA in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the ILA-LASA academic dialogue served as a "second track" for probing the positions of Moscow and Washington on issues of their policies in the Western Hemisphere (primarily in the context of the Central American conflict). The conclusion sets out the circumstances of the decline of the mechanism of bilateral scientific exchange in the second half of the 1980s.

AB The study analyses the intra-party discussion on the fourth draft programme of the CPSU in 1991. The following methods were used to study the problem: narrative and historical-typological. The source base of the article was the "Transcript of the joint meeting of the ideological commission and the commission on science, education and culture of 12 July 1991" from the fund "The Commission of the CPSU Central Committee (1989-1991)" of the Russian state archive of modern history. By the early 1990s, the CPSU had lost its former unity as it entered a period of destructive factional fighting. M. S. Gorbachev realised that if the cause of the conflict was not addressed, the party would inevitably split. As a solution to the problem, he considered updating the CPSU programme, as the old concept did not meet the changed political situation and became the most important factor of confrontation between warring factions. At the XXVIII congress, a programme commission was elected. Its main purpose was to develop a draft document. By 12 July 1991, the programme commission presented the fourth version of the draft to a joint meeting of the standing ideological commission and the commission on science, education and culture for a final revision before the July plenum. In the course of analysing the discussion, it was possible to group the participants of the polemic according to their political views. The speakers were divided into conservatives, reformers and centrists. Participants of each faction had different views on the future of the CPSU programme. Thus, representatives of conservatives spoke quite harshly about the weakness and imperfection of the project. In their opinion, it did not provide for such essential elements of communist ideology as orientation towards the proletarian strata, reliance on a social state with a managed economy, and the strengthening of party structures to retain power. The conservatives were opposed by reformers with a liberal agenda. This included full acceptance of the spirit of the programme, insistence on radicalising market reforms and measures leading to a weakening of party hegemony. The last faction of centrists tried to reconcile the warring factions by creating a consolidating version of the programme. Their proposals contained compromise theses that could, in theory, satisfy each of the platforms. Nevertheless, it was not possible to reach an agreement, as the centrists did not find support from other factions and found themselves in the minority. Based on the sentiments of the speakers, most of them held an orthodox position. The conservatives were confident of their victory and did not consider it necessary to concede, and neither did the reformers. Thus, the revealed irreconcilability and fierceness of the discussion showed that factions within the CPSU were unable to coexist constructively. The party was inevitably approaching a political split.

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to the key obstacles that complicate the implementation of public diplomacy programmes of the European Union in China. The relevance of this study is due to the existing efforts of Brussels to significantly strengthen its political influence not only in the countries neighbouring the EU but also in the Asia-Pacific region. Methods. The methodological basis of the research is social constructivism (the concept of "Normative Power Europe"), which pays great attention to norms in international relations. The empirical basis of the study involves official EU documents, expert reports and publications of Russian and foreign scholars. Analysis. The article examines the main actors and areas of public diplomacy of the European Union in China. The impact of restrictive measures by the Chinese government on EU public diplomacy as well as the EU foreign policy strategy towards China are analyzed. Results. In China, the EU's public diplomacy faces a set of different challenges: administrative barriers from the Chinese government; ambivalence of the EU's foreign policy towards China; the shortcomings of the existing EU public diplomacy system (lack of financial and human resources as well as a "mediocre" assessment of the effectiveness of public diplomacy programmes). According to the authors, the commitment of the EU political elites to certain values and norms that constitute "Normative Power Europe" creates serious challenges for the implementation of the EU's public diplomacy in China. Authors' contribution. K.A. Morari identified key actors and areas of public diplomacy of the European Union in China. In addition, A.N. Marchukov highlighted the main obstacles that hinder Brussels' attempts to "win the hearts and minds" of the Chinese public.

DT Article
DE federalism; unitarianism; liberalism; nation-state; modernity; elite
   conflict; cultural differentiation; secession; right of nations to
   self-determination; instrumentalism
AB The article is devoted to substantiating the controversial thesis that federalism is not an autonomous type of political structure. Federations are interpreted as a set of specific failures of different origins in the course of following the basic modern scenario of the formation of a unitary nation-state with a consolidated (civil) political identity. The article has for theoretical basis the actor approach, which interprets the political form of the federation as a derivative result of a conflict pact between the central and peripheral elites. In this methodological perspective, the history of the concept of federalism is examined and a comparative historical analysis of the world federal experience is carried out. As a result, a number of interrelated author's conclusions were formulated. First, it is shown that the original Kantian project of a world federation of states has little in common with federalism, which refers to the description of the internal structure of individual societies. Secondly, the conclusion is substantiated by the fact that in the modern theory of federalism a harmful mainstream tradition has developed, which scales as a normative successful experience the centralizing federalism in the United States. Thirdly, the cultural and historical features of the formation of two families of federations are highlighted and analyzed, one of which is associated with the acquisition of independence by offshoots of the West, and the other was formed by the later processes of the collapse of the colonial empires of the West and the liberation of colonies in Africa and Eurasia. Fourthly, it is argued that the federal political structure at the theoretical level was intended to reconcile, at the basis of the political project of Modernity, the liberal utopia of a universal and culturally homogeneous civil nation and the actual cultural diversity of any modern states, which is a permanent source of erosion of its political sovereignty and differentiation of collective identities. Fifthly, it is proved that all derived political, legal, economic and other signs of federalism are due to one initial problem - the legitimation and subsequent institutionalization of the conflict between the central elite and regional elites, challenging the indivisibility of political sovereignty and demanding political autonomy. Sixth, federalism as a changeable pact of elites in specific historical societies does not provide convincing grounds for its qualification as an autonomous political form compared to a unitary nation-state. The final conclusion is that the political format of federalism in most states is a long-term way of formalizing the political divorce of cultural communities that could not create a common political nation.

TI DISENCHANTING THE WESTERN MAINSTREAM
SO SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE alternative; Eurocentrism; West; end of history; legitimation;
   mainstream; narrative; modernity; social sciences
AB The changing global social ontology entails an inevitable transformation of the normative model for self-description of modern society in social sciences. As diverse limits to growth are reached (capacity of global markets, demography, ecology, mass employment, etc.), the search for and legitimation of alternative social hierarchies and principles of resource distribution is actualised complicated by the stagnant humanity's resource base and the appropriation of intellectual rents and infrastructural (technological, military, economic) advantages by an increasingly insignificant minority. These background tendencies lead to a) an inevitable transformation of dominant perceptions of what constitutes social, economic, political norms and b) an increasingly critical reception of normative self- descriptions of Western societies, which previously, due to the unconditional dominance of the West, were offered as the ideal of social organisation for all others. The alternative to the Western mainstream is increasingly centered around notions and concepts that describe a future beyond the ideologically loaded and increasingly irrelevant models of liberal democracies and self-regulated markets, which have been controversially and very limitedly realized in the historical practice of Western societies. The global debate on universal social norms is driven by a renewed socio- political and economic context that universally registers for most citizens the inequalities and injustices of the de facto oligopoly markets and elitist democracies that encompass all modern societies. The disenchantment (M. Weber) of the narrative of liberal- market democracies is confirmed by the global rise of nationalisms, protectionism, populism, the widespread contraction of the welfare state and the uprisings of various minorities, including in Western countries, revealing an increasing divergence between social theory, ideology and ontology at the base of the end of history, which turned out only to be its new, post- Western turn.

DT Article
DE sociology of the body; body; technologies; artificial intelligence; body

AB The article considers the features of the body functioning in the era of the widespread introduction of digital technologies, primarily artificial intelligence. First, the authors show how body studies developed in social sciences and humanities - from the ancient ideas about the body to the contemporary concepts with a wide range of issues, approaches and theories that address the category of the body from various positions. Then the basic functions of the body are considered: identity formation, communicative, and functions of a cultural model, political control and subjective experience. The authors describe the transformation of these functions under the increasing convergence of the human body with the latest technologies, focusing on the functions of subjective experience, identity formation, and communicative function. The authors analyze the convergence of the body and technical devices, showing how their hybrids arise as the distance between them decreases. The article outlines the main smart technologies (smart watches and fitness bracelets, smart rings, smart clothing, smart implants, sleep monitors, VR and AR technologies) and key aspects of people's interaction with smart devices in the perspective of physiology, psychology, social interaction and work efficiency. There is a dual question of the relationship between the body and artificial intelligence technologies: transformations of the human body in the era of the latest digital technologies, with the acquisition of new qualities and properties by the body; and the acquisition of corporeality by artificial intelligence technologies, including social consequences of the convergence of the body and technologies - both positive (improved quality of life and medical care, expanded opportunities for some social groups, etc.) and negative (dependence on technologies, growth of social inequality, etc.). The conclusion highlights the need for a more in- depth study of the issues under consideration and outlines more controversial issues within the interaction between man and technology.

DE Israel; Japan; cooperation; history; politics; economics
AB From an analysis of Russian, Israeli, Japanese, and various English-language sources, the authors conclude that this paper is one of the few studies on the topic of Japanese-Israeli relations in the field of Oriental studies. In particular, in Russian Oriental studies, this is the first article focusing on Japanese-Israeli relations. The authors aim not only to trace the dynamics of bilateral relations in socio-political and economic aspects but also to identify the reasons for their complex history. The study also explores potential future developments. This goal has shaped the article's structure. It includes a literature review, an examination of cooperation prerequisites, an analysis of political and economic components, and a conclusion. The study's analysis of historical factors, primarily the Japanese Empire's attitude towards Jewry, reveals that no significant obstacles existed before diplomatic relations were established to hinder current bilateral and multilateral interaction. Moreover, Japan's Prime Minister Abe Shinz & omacr; relied on positive past experiences to foster increased contacts between Tokyo and Jerusalem. Economic considerations and dependence on external energy resources have played a crucial role in the political and diplomatic sphere for both states. This has led Japanese authorities to maintain a balanced course in the Middle East. Over time, the significance of this task has grown as Tokyo seeks to enhance its international status, particularly within the UN and its specialized agencies. In the realm of economic cooperation, internal crises and differing economic models have hindered progress for a considerable period. However, the distinctive national economies and entrepreneurial cultures of Japan and Israel now present significant opportunities for collaboration.

AB In the context of growing global political tension and establishing the world trade barriers, the urgent task is to develop the new tools for assessing their consequences. In this paper we present the agent - based model of trade wars, considering organizations in different countries generated using initial statistical data of the countries' industries. Simulation determines changes in output and supplies of organizations under trade restrictions. Results of calculations on the developed model and comparison of various model complexes' forecasts with real consequences of trade wars between the USA and China in 2018 and Western countries against Russia in 2022 are presented. Four scenarios were considered: (1) baseline, (2) new mutual restrictions between China and the USA, (3) more serious sanctions against China and Russia by the USA and the EU, (4) global trade war. In the second scenario deviation GDP of the USA and China from the baseline scenario does not exceed 0.5%. In the third scenario, the number of countries involved is expanding, and the fall in their GDP is expected at the level of 0.7-1.0%. In the fourth scenario, the entire world economy experiences a serious slowdown, and the EU countries are facing the most severe consequences, going into recession.

AB The article aims to compare traditional priorities in the system of students' axiological worldview in the resource-type region using the example of Kuzbass, as well as to identify the relationship between the educational trajectory of the chosen educational institution of higher education and traditional values transmitted under the influence of educational and upbringing processes by student youth. The scientific understanding of the phenomenon of the students' axiological worldview is shown through the factor of value foundations. The authors pay attention to the study of the values of young people as one of the important elements of political culture. Attention is focused on the comparison of traditional axiological views of students from different universities in Kuzbass. The basis for the comparison is an understanding of the essence of traditional values and spiritual and moral values, the place of family values among the priorities of young people, an assessment of religion, culture and the Russian language as the axiological foundations of our state. It was revealed that the students' axiological worldview can be assessed on the "material-spiritual values" scale. The conclusions show that students of an agricultural university (Kuzbass State Agrarian University) are more motivated by material values; therefore, for them the value of family is secondary in relation to material wealth, education, and career. Students of Kemerovo State Institute of Culture are more focused in their beliefs on self-realization in the cultural sphere; therefore, moral categories are prioritized, although material well-being is not denied as a guarantee of both family well-being and self-realization in creative activities. Students of different universities (especially cultural institutes) pay special attention to the concept of freedom. Students define freedom as a civil category that determines opportunities for selfdevelopment and professional growth. Culture, religion, and the preservation of the Russian language are assessed by young people as complementary and constantly changing categories. At the same time, the risk is such phenomena as distortion of historical memory in the culture of our country, facts of desecration of Russian culture and language, and not changes within the culture or the Russian language.

AB The article is a review of the monograph by historian O.A. Milevsky on the ideology of Russian political terror by revolutionary populist Valerian Andreevich Osinsky. Based on a thorough historiographical analysis, it is shown that the book is the first special comprehensive study of the life path of Valerian Osinsky in world historical science. The non-trivial title of the monograph, "Steps to the Scaffold", and the competent structural composition of the book are emphasized. The methodological basis of the monographic research is analyzed and its interdisciplinary nature is shown. Special attention is paid to the productivity of the psychohistorical concepts of Eric Erickson and Lloyd De Moze. Using the example of the hero of the monograph in four chapters-"steps", the author consistently analyzes the typical and specific ways of formation of the Russian youth of the 1870s, which turn it into an irreconcilable opposition to the autocratic regime. The main attention is paid to the generational conflict between the "fathers", the highest personification of which was the state, and the "children", that is, the radical youth. This conflict is shown as a reflection of the contradictions of two eras: the outgoing and the upcoming. The new data presented in the monograph once again emphasize the fact of uncompromising confrontation between the government and society in post-reform Russia. Attention is drawn to the fact that in Osinsky's life, as if in a mirror, the moral problems of the correlation of the purpose and means of political action were reflected in the absence of dialogue between the warring parties. When studying the activities of the Executive Committee of the Russian Social Revolutionary Party created by Valerian Osinsky, it is noted that the author raised a fundamental and urgent question about the permissibility of political violence in the struggle against the authorities in the absence of legal opportunities for citizens to protect human rights against administrative arbitrariness. Based on the biography of Osinsky presented in the monograph, the cruel lessons of history that have not yet been learned by Russian society are formulated.

AB The paper analyzes the operations of NKVD fighter battalions in Leningrad and the surrounding region from 1942 to 1944, using previously unpublished sources from the Central State Archive of Historical and Political Documents in St. Petersburg (TSGAIPD). These sources include official NKVD documents, relevant statutes, and statistical data. The article examines the effectiveness and models of the use of these units in the challenging circumstances of besieged Leningrad, as well as territories of the region, including those outside the blockade ring. Particular focus is given to the support provided to Leningrad's fighter battalions and the restructuring of the unit system during the brutal first winter of the blockade. Additionally, the paper analyzes the management practices of the Leningrad fighter battalions and their transformation in response to changing situations at the front and in the rear. Attention is also paid to the use of these units during the blockade and after its breakthrough, leading to the final liberation of the region from occupation. The author examines the gender, social, and professional composition of the fighter battalions in the city and the region, as well as the dynamics of their numbers. The author concludes that while the effectiveness of the fighter battalions operating in Leningrad and the region was limited, leading to an operational reduction in the number of personnel of the city battalions during the winter of 1942, the fighter units remained actively deployed as auxiliary forces until their disbandment. They played crucial roles in maintaining order and controlling territory near the frontlines.

DE John of Nikiu; Alaric; Visigoths; city of Rome; church history-writing
AB A Coptic bishop of the city of Nikiu in the Nile Delta John of Nikiu (the second half of the 7 th c. AD) is famous for his only text - "Chronicle", which is narrating about events from the Creation to the 640s, but it's hard to treat the genre peculiarities of this work. Anyway, John intensively used the works of Greek-speaking church historians of the first half of the 5 th c., that of Socrates Scholasticus and Hermias Sozomenos, in this way, a comparison of their evidence will enable not only to scan genre features of John's "Chronicle", but also to represent special points of his world-view. To make this comparison, the author of present paper chose an event prominent for the Late Roman Empire - a sack and capture of Rome by Visigoth chief Alaric in 410 AD. Describing Alaric's deeds, John paid main attention not to plunders and destructions made by Goths in Rome, but to plots of the Senators against West Roman Emperor Honorius (395-423), while Greek church historians (including even Arian Philostorgius) depicted in depth strictly a siege and plundering of Rome. In this way, the author of the paper attempts to clear, why John neglected a meaning of destructions made by Alaric in Rome. In contrast to Greek historians, John doesn't label Alaric as barbarian, he even doesn't think on capture of Rome as on turning-point and tragic event, to John's view it's a routing event happened in the frameworks of political clashes and strife within West Roman Empire. What is most essential is that John doesn't see in Rome's capture a sign of God's Providence, Alaric for him is a tool only of political clash between the Senators and the Emperor. To sum up, John actively combined traditions of two genres - secular and church history-writing, his work may be assessed not as chronicle as such, but rather as a mixture of church and secular (pagan) histories.

DE public space; privatization; good
AB Restrictions imposed on the free use of public space, or the privatization of public space, have become widespread in recent decades. Actions taken in relation to public space in the direction of limiting its openness and accessibility indicate that this space is of value to people, groups, and communities as an object that they want to control. Thinking about public space as a value involves considering its location at different levels of the hierarchy of goods. The typologies of goods of Aristotle, Alasdair McIntyre, George Moore, J... Rawls are of interest. Richard Musgrave's classification of goods is based on the criteria of competitiveness in the possibility of obtaining a good and the possibility of excluding someone from the consumers of the good. I consider Musgrave's classification of goods in the following sequence: public, common, club, private. The two main features of public goods are non- competitiveness in consumption and non-excludability. These goods are available to anyone and everyone. Common goods are non-excludable but competitive. In turn, the right to possess a club good is partly competitive because club members decide who is worthy of becoming one of them. For this reason, club goods are non-excludable goods. Private goods are goods with high competitiveness in consumption and excludability, i.e., deprivation of access to the good. The line leading from public and common goods to private goods is the line leading to a decrease in the scale and value of public space as publicly accessible and open, and a corresponding increase in its value as inaccessible and closed space. This line is the line that leads to the privatization of space. Privatized public space has a value as a good accessible to the few, and therefore it is a good that is not in the interests of the majority. The privatization of public space leads to a weakening of communication and solidarity between people who share an open and accessible space with each other. The implementation of actions leading to the privatization of public space occurs because individuals and groups involved place little value on public space as a public and common good. The interest in a higher value of public space as a club and private good contributes to the intensification of their actions to increase the exclusivity of their use of this space for their own benefit.

ID RELEVANCE
AB The article deals with the Hobbesian state of nature as a foundational model for his epistemic ideal of "civil science." The first part elucidates the state of nature argument in the context of the Hobbesian "innovative" definition of "civil philosophy" (philosophia civilis) which significantly differs in argumentative standards from contemporary ethics and political philosophy. The second part connects the Hobbesian state of nature and his "natural logic" as specific forms of "first philosophy" concerned with the stabilization of "first definitions" for "civil science", necessary for "civil science" proper but not a part of it. The third part introduces the state of nature in Hobbes as a "practical" thought experiment made possible by specific observations of our own everyday experience revealed as self-knowledge. Here, the state of nature functions as Hans Vaihingher's half-fiction, that is, as an informal explanatory model connecting counterfactual possibilities and actuality. The connection occurs in the form of an elaborate "thought experiment" inside actuality, providing not only the counterfactual "limiting case" explaining a range of possible situations, but also a continuum of quasi-narrative descriptions of possible situations and courses of events leading to negative consequences, namely, to controversy in opinions and contention in wills. The fourth part shows how these quasi-narrative descriptions are captured by an understanding of the state of nature model as "possible histories", providing the basic "range of possibilities" (Spielraum in the sense of Wolfgang von Kries) for Hobbesian "civil science" proper as a science of public right. The state of nature as "Spielraum" allows us to capture specifically political possibilities which form the background for Hobbesian "civil science." Therefore, the state of nature model provides the "first principles" for the Hobbesian constructive "civil science" in the form of an elaborate probabilistic model.

AB In 2022 the United States published two strategically important documents - the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States. (February 2022) and the National Security Strategy (October 2022), according to which the Indo-Pacific Region (IPR) is highlighted as one of the priorities of foreign and military policy. Based on the study of official documents and US policy in the IPR, the article analyzes the features of modern models of regional policy of the Joe Biden administration and the factors influencing the new US policy. The theories of integration, securitization, conflict management, regionalism, and decolonization are used as a methodological basis of the research. When assessing the influence of the intra-American factor on the US strategy in the IPR, the author refers to the theories of elite circulation. The author of the study came to the following conclusions. First, the weakening of the US position in the IPR is influenced by the internal political struggle of the US elites. There is a widespread perception in the US and the IPR that the Trump administration has seriously undermined US power and position in the region, alienating long-standing allies and partners. Second, the intensifying rivalry between the US and China has put the countries of the region in a difficult choice, a way out of which medium and small states are finding in hedging and regional integration policies (ASEAN as an example). And the policies of India and Indonesia are characterized as "Swing Global States". Third, the US implements a policy in the region called in the academic literature "hub-and-spokes alliance model". Within the framework of this model, the "spokes" are minilateral agreements between the US and ASEAN and other IPR states on a selected topic. Fourth, based on these factors, the Biden administration is betting on the development of a system of minilateral agreements. Fifth, it is still an open question whether the new model strengthens or challenges the San Francisco security system. In any case, the minilateral treaty system is now becoming one of the pillars of US influence in the IPR.

AB The early twentieth century in Russia was not only a period of tremendous political upheavals, but also a time of desperate struggle for public health and epidemiological security of the country. Soviet historiography's image of a declining empire unable to cope with plague and cholera epidemics does not quite correspond to reality. The Russian Empire was not going to die a natural death and found the strength to meet the challenges posed by the most dangerous infectious diseases. At the same time, Russian public medicine, which emerged in the second half of the 19th century, in which doctors of the Pirogov Society played a major role, was practically incapable of repelling the onslaught of deadly pathogens in the early 20th century. On the contrary, the Imperial administration, which had repeatedly demonstrated its incapacity in this field, was able to mobilize and support the development of the new science of bacteriology at the very beginning of the twentieth century. Just a few years before and immediately after the First Russian Revolution, bacteriology was included in the arsenal of the most important tools used in the interests of public health and epidemiological security in Russia.

DE sentimentalism; romanticism; cosiness; utopia; alienation; Jean-Jacques
   Rousseau; Rachel Jaeggy
AB -Jacques Jaeggy. The article discusses the utopia of a cosy life as a response to the challenges of modernity, primarily technology and digitalization. The history of the utopia of cosiness are traced from the project of "family happiness," or "good" life in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's novel Julia, or the New Heloise. The author shows why this project cannot be considered as utopia in the full sense of the word. Sentimentalism is being replaced by romanticism, which is not characterized by utopian thinking, since the ideal of romance is a specific inner state that cannot be described as part of the world. Romanticism sees the world of the future in the optics of science fiction, and reality - as a dystopia. The author interprets Karl Marx's theory of alienation as a dystopia, since it is formulated in terms of affects. Furthermore, Rachel Jaeggy's modern theory of alienation is considered, in which political and economic issues are present as little as the romantic ideal of realizing the human essence. Jaeggy's concept combines elements of critical theory with analytical social psychology. Its main idea is the total appropriation of the world, which the author of the article calls generous. She assumes that alienation is the absence of relationships where they should be, so its elimination comes down to building relationships with practically anything. Jaeggy leaves aside the question of what internal mechanisms should move a person to generous appropriation. The author shows that Jaeggy's theory is neo-sentimentalist and has much in common with Rousseau's "good" life. However, Jaeggy's theory borrowed belief in progress from romanticism. It turns out to be a constitutive element of generous appropriation. Progress takes on the function of bare necessity, or Marx's "nonhuman" force. It stands above capitalism and any other social relations. As a result, a person is relieved of responsibility for anything that goes beyond his private life. But this conclusion comes across an important feature of progress: it brings happiness to some people, using others as a resource. The utopia of a comfortable life turns out to be a call to ignore this circumstance.

DE science; truth; hysteria; Max Weber; Ilya Kasavin
AB I connect the idea of an existential turn in philosophical science, presented by Ilya Kasavin and Vladimir Porus in their recent article, with the problem of rationality and culture crisis, as well as the opposition of profession and vocation in Max Weber's famous speech on politics. I offer an analysis of the structure of vocation to politics and to science as affects of a special kind. To do this, I draw on Jacques Lacan's analysis of hysteria. My conclusions are that the structure of a target affect coincides to that of hysteria. This means that scientist tries to show that the truth exists, seeks to force other people to recognize this fact and submit to science as an only acceptable form of worldview. Until this can be done, the scientist gives his relationship to the community the character of service to the highest entity. At the same time, he waits for the inversion of this service, i.e. a transition to power through acknowledgement. It should be noted that scientific research is never limited by the science itself, no matter how dangerous it may be. The existential choice in science is a choice between the pursuit of truth in natural sciences and exact sciences and maintaining the sustainability of culture in social and humanitarian knowledge. The latter, contrary to Weber, is always intertwined with politics. The first is not political, but affective. This allows me to see the definition of the vocation to the science that Kasavin gives in a new way. At the center of the "cognitive-existential mood" in the search for truth, affect dominates, the engine of which is hysteria, and in its basic attitudes truth and the scientist are opposed to the plausible and the profane.

DE theory of argumentation; pragmatic presupposition; deliberation;
   metadiscursivity; practical modality
AB The aim of the article is to explore a class of debates where subject is an impossible state of affairs or an impossible action. We argue that the choice of position in such a debate is based on agent's pragmatic presupposition, which is a set of assumed causal relations within the fragment of the world accompanied by the idea of agency. The content of pragmatic presupposition and its relations with known pragmatic presuppositions of other parties determines for each participant a set of her indirect aims of the dispute. In the model we use, there are three stages of debates: a dispute about agenda, a discussion of the merits of the case, and a deliberation about the action. Within each of these stages, the parties may have a separate set of indirect aims. For the first stage of the debate, the most typical indirect aim of each of the parties is to declare themselves. For the second stage of the debate, the dominant indirect aim is to influence the audience and maintain one's own authority in its eyes. Finally, for the third stage of the debate, the most typical indirect aim is to achieve any positive consequences even if there is obviously no possibility of realizing what is being discussed.

   Ethnic Discrimination; Anti-Semitism
AB There is a widespread opinion about the predominance of Jews in party and Soviet government bodies, especially the Cheka, in 1917-1939. New sources introduced in post-Soviet historiography does not confirm the fact of Jewish dominance either in the Russian revolutionary movement or in the administration of the USSR in the pre-war period, although they indicate a significant presence of Jews in the ranks of Russian revolutionaries, and from 1917 to the end 1930s - among Soviet officials. During the thaw years (mid-1950s - mid-1960s), discrimination was mitigated, but in a hidden form it existed informally until the collapse of the USSR. Infringement of the rights of Jews was observed in all spheres of life, but especially in the political one. Most discriminatory measures did not have clear legislative or administrative formalization and were disguised as a fight against bourgeois nationalism, cosmopolitanism or Zionism. The correction of the role of Jews in power is based on numerous data, but due to their fragmentation and incomparability, it is not systemic in nature, leaving open the question of the dynamics and scale of Jewish participation in the governance of the USSR not only after 1953, but also in the pre-war period. Turning to mass statistical data from population censuses, containing information on employment, sectoral and professional structure of the employed population at a national level, helps to close this gap. The analysis carried out leads to the conclusion: there is no reason to talk about Jewish dominance in any government body either in the pre-war or post-war period. The presence of Jews in power and their influence is often exaggerated for the reason that the percentage of Jews in leadership was transferred to the entire administrative apparatus.

DE paleoaesthetics; hermeneutics; philosophy of history; philosophy of
   geology; philosophy of paleontology; metaphors
AB The article discusses a new book by Derek Turner, Paleoaesthetics and the Practice of Paleontology, which is the first outline on the given topic with a fairly wide coverage of current research literature. In a sense, Turner's work can be viewed as an invitation to a dialogue between researchers who are interested in the philosophical and methodological problems of geology in general and paleontology in particular. The presented application of Turner for the construction of the theory of aesthetic values in the earth sciences requires a comprehensive consideration and study by different researchers. The aim of this article is to determine the place of Turner's concept of paleoaesthetics in the general field of Western European philosophy. The article proves that Turner, like the classic of hermeneutics Gadamer, points to a close relationship between epistemic (historical) and aesthetic values in cognition. The dependence of our aesthetic perception of a fossil on the knowledge of its history, which Turner points out, can be described without distortion of meaning in terms of hermeneutics, namely, through the concept of the hermeneutic circle and the role of prior knowledge in historical knowledge. Also, Turner's appeal to reflection on metaphors in paleontology, as on the poetic dimension of knowledge, also correlates with the idea of Hayden White, a classic of the philosophy of history of the 20th century, about the need to reflect on the poetic dimension of historical knowledge, as well as the fundamental role of the poetic in the construction of historical works. In addition, in his desire to make paleontology more exploratory and to move away from the descriptive nature of studies of the history of the Earth, Turner conducts the same operation as R. J. Collingwood, who strictly separated the descriptive history of "scissors and glue" from scientific history. In the author's opinion, Turner's replacement of the "textual record" metaphor in relation to fossils with the "investigative tool" metaphor is similar in meaning to the replacement of the "source" metaphor by the "evidence" metaphor that Collingwood produced in relation to historical initial data. Based on this, it is concluded that the similarity of the ideas of Turner and the classics of hermeneutics and the philosophy of history gives reason to believe that paleoaesthetics in the form proposed by Turner should be considered as one of the sections of hermeneutics and philosophy of history. Such an understanding of the place of paleoaesthetics in the world philosophical tradition, on the one hand, will contribute to the use of the achievements of the main trends in philosophy for the development of philosophical paleoaesthetics; on the other hand, turning to classical philosophical works will help to avoid doubling the meanings and building similar classical philosophical concepts about geological (paleontological) knowledge.

AB The present study seeks to deepen the understanding of Xenophon's political philosophy as it is reflected in Socrates' investigation of economic knowledge in the dialogue titled Oeconomicus. The study concentrates on the six conventional parts of the oikos or household (house, things, slaves, land, horses, and wife), which are loosely connected with six facets of human life (pleasure, order, rule, leisure, enrichment, and education), as presented by the perfect gentleman (rich and successful) Ischomachus and his pupil, the (poor and wretched) philosopher Socrates. It demonstrates how the latter, learning Ischomachus' economic teaching, radically transforms it, simultaneously showing the most serious possibilities lying behind the common notions of economic and political life and the inherent limitations of their fulfillment and threatening to undermine (and, indeed, undermining, in the personal case of Socrates) said ways of life as they are conventionally perceived.

DE commemorations; Napoleon Bonaparte; Piedmont; political acculturation;

AB Official holidays during the years of the French conquest of Piedmont are important for understanding the cultural policy of France in Italy at the beginning of the 19(th) century. The article is devoted to the problem of official commemorations in the lands of the former Sardinian kingdom in the period from 1799 to 1814. In 1799-1801 here they solemnly celebrated the anniversary of the execution of Louis XVI, the day of July 14, the proclamation of the French Republic on September 22, the day of victory in the Battle of Marengo on June 14 and the day of the annexation of Piedmont to France. The authorities tried to give these important dates a universal historical character, which played a significant role in the policy of revolutionary acculturation. After the creation of the empire in 1804, policies slowly changed: starting in 1806, four holidays were combined. Every year on August 15, St. Napoleon's Day and the conclusion of the Concordat were celebrated, and on the first Sunday in December, the anniversary of Napoleon's coronation and the day of victory in the Battle of Austerlitz. The need to legitimize and sacralize the new Bonaparte dynasty led to major changes. The imperial government and local authorities in the departments pursued a policy of synthesis of secular and church ceremonies, tried to influence public sentiment with the help of official commemorations, and organize a single cycle of important holidays with political overtones, which, however, did not lead to decisive changes in the public consciousness of the Piedmontese people. And moreover, this was very negatively perceived by the parish clergy and peasantry, which did not help strengthen the institutions of the Napoleonic state in the Italian lands.

AB Introduction. Ineffective resolution of economic problems by political institutions can jeopardize a country's technological sovereignty in the face of existing geopolitical challenges. The purpose of the article is to identify areas for increasing the efficiency of the functioning of political institutions from the point of view of ensuring the economic security of the southern Russian regions, considering the challenges of socio-economic development that exist for them. Methodology and methods. This study centers on the Southern Federal District, which acts as an administrative entity responsible for implementing regional-level economic policies. The research utilized content analysis of scientific publications and comparative analysis of regional socio-economic indicators of economic development as part of implementing economic policy. The method for analyzing the influence of political institutions on economic development was based on the principle of balancing the combination of tactical and strategic decisions in assessing the effectiveness of implemented measures and was based on the basic principles of the theory of factors of production. Analysis. An analysis of the results of the economic policy pursued in the southern Russian regions showed that a relatively high level of resistance to sanctions challenges is ensured mainly by the export capabilities of agricultural products. However, the continued high level of import dependence on production increases the risk of conflict over the use of production factors between export- oriented companies and companies oriented to the domestic market, which creates significant threats to the implementation of national growth models. The turn of state economic policy towards the global East and South poses the tasks of the authorities of the southern Russian regions to develop transport infrastructure, as well as state support for companies participating in the construction of new production and supply chains. At the same time, increasing migration flows from border areas requires solving the problem of ensuring the socio-economic well-being of both the people moving and the host community. Results. It was found that the existing political risks to the economic development of southern Russian regions are associated with a lack of balance between the political decisions made and the strategic objectives of achieving technological sovereignty. It is concluded that the conditions of modern economic reality require economic and political mobilization to achieve value consensus and consolidation in society in order to solve the problems of economic development, implemented through the responsibility and patriotic position of political and economic elites at all levels of government.

DE family history; family myth; axiological orientations; traditional
   values; modern family
AB "Family myth" has not arrived to sociological tradition yet; nevertheless, it has long been appropriated by psychological theory and practice in dealing with "dysfunctional" families. However, "family myth" receives a wider interpretation in the twenty-first century in the context of family identity as an idea that unifies all family members, also merging family myth with family history. Thus, we meet an opportunity to investigate deeper the family myth opportunities, including the inclusion of family myth into the "body" of modern family and modern society. Analyzing mythological potential of family histories in our research, we arrived to the following conclusions. Family history is also a family myth, as it essentially represents an emotionally valent word. Family myth realizes a suggestive function as a coercive mechanism applicable to individuals in authorizing urgent collective behavioral and cognitive norms. Expressing the family unconscious, the myth also realizes the obligations that ensue the norms. Meanwhile the coercion mechanism is supported by trustful mind, the "legitimizing apparatuses" sanctified by the authority of parents and ancestors. Family myth is an event realized on the border of the immanent and the transcendent. Family mythology is the mythology of quotidian life that also structures the everyday human life worlds. At the same time, family myth appeals to ancestors and transmits transcendental meanings generated by mutual human experiences. The communicative nature of myth and the essential meaningfulness of transmittance within the family myth could explain the probability of autonomy and intersubjectivity while moving from one everyday world to another one. Meanwhile, the "inner family transmittance" functions as identification, socialization, and empathy with adaptation and reflection that nurture formation and transmission of personal axiological orientations.

DE content of beliefs; possible worlds semantics; doxastic logic; framing
   effects; logical omniscience; modeling of bounded rationality
AB The article discusses the problems of formalizing the content of propositional attitudes and how successfully these problems can be solved in possible worlds semantics. The focus of attention is, firstly, on the phenomena that in the psychological literature are called framing effects and in the semantic literature substitution violation in indirect contexts, and, secondly, the problem of logical omniscience. The first part of the article explains why framing effects create a problem for possible worlds semantics and why the agent is inevitably modeled as logically omniscient in this semantics. Next, a description is given of four approaches to the problem of framing effects in possible worlds semantics: metasemantic, pragmatic, multi-model, and the approach associated with modeling topics. For each of the first three, their main shortcomings are given in relation to this problem and in general. The results of applying the latter approach are considered in more detail in the next part of the article using the example of one of the modern systems of doxastic logic, namely the logic of framing effects by Berto and Ozgun. The syntax and semantic rules of this logic are outlined, after which it is explained how, according to these rules, the description of framing effects should look like. Models of situations are given in which an agent has both a belief in some proposition and a lack of belief in another proposition, which is necessarily equivalent to the first one. It is shown that the modeling method used does not lead to problems and is intuitively adequate. In the last part, the axiomatics of the logic of framing effects is presented and some theorems are given that are significant in the context of the problem of logical omniscience. An interpretation of these theorems is given, on the basis of which it is concluded that this logic does not cope with the problem of logical omniscience as successfully as with the framing effects themselves. In conclusion, a direction is proposed in which the logic of framing effects can be developed in order to more fully solve the problem of logical omniscience with its help, and the prospects for such development are discussed.

DE entailment; relevant implication; syntax and semantics of relevant
   logic; theory of relevant inference
AB The article defends the following theses: (1) The interpretation of relevant implication as a formalization of the natural concept of entailment leads to the fact that the logical properties attributed to the implication in a specific version of relevant logic are transferred to the level of semantics and determine the properties of the model. (2) The means of transfer is the "relevant" principle of deduction, which in one form or another is necessarily present in each of the logics, since it is the only intuitively acceptable option for justifying the formalization of the conditional connective proposed by this logic. (3) Being syntactic in form, the "relevant" principle of deduction carries essential semantic information, namely information about the model. This information determines how meanings of sentences that form the antecedent and consequent of the relevant implication are related.

DT Article
DE Marx; philosophy; sociology; social reality; society; history; activity;
   socialism
AB During the post -Soviet period of Russian history, a negative attitude towards Karl Marx was established in public opinion, who is considered the author of an eschatological utopia, the bankruptcy of which is considered self-evident proof of the scientific failure of the "materialistic understanding of history". Objecting to this point of view, the author examines the basic concepts of Marx's philosophical and sociological doctrine, which (provided they are correctly understood and rejected from unlawful absolutization) remain valid for modern science. At the same time, the author examines Marx's ideas, which are not confirmed by the course of modern history, which primarily include the German thinker's ideas about the state and fate of modern capitalism. The author believes that the undoubted mistake of Marx, who mistook the birth pangs of civilized capitalism for its agony, should not be used to discredit the formational typology of history and Marx's ideas about the socialist perspective of development. To prove this idea, it is important to understand that Marx is not responsible for the social system created by the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, which was not related to the socialist organization of society, representing the reincarnation of the political orders established in a European country on an industrial rather than agricultural basis. The natural collapse of this society was realized in full accordance with the postulates of the materialistic understanding of history and cannot be used as an argument in favor of their scientific failure.

DT Article
DE libertarianism; egalitarianism; luck; sufficiency; distributive justice;
   natural rights
AB Most right-libertarians deny the permissibility of government redistribution, referring to the inviolability of private property rights. In a rare exception, Eric Mack offers a right-libertarian argument for luck sufficientarianism based on the catastrophe clause. In this view, people who find themselves in trouble through no fault of their own may violate someone else's property rights in minor ways to save their own lives. But since a literal interpretation of this clause makes property rights too uncertain, Mack proposes a system of redistribution that will protect people from dire circumstances. As it only applies to those who find themselves in poverty through no fault of their own, Mack's argument rules out a basic income. However, one can combine Mack's argument with basic income by arguing that responsibility-insensitive sufficientarianism is superior to luck sufficientarianism. First, luck sufficientarianism allows for the counterintuitive conclusion that people who have made mistakes in their lives do not deserve help from the rest of the community, even if they are engaged in some socially important activity. Second, luck sufficientarianism unduly interferes with people's private lives to distinguish between deserving and undeserving recipients of social assistance, and inevitably excludes some deserving recipients from the pool of recipients. Third, a condition for holding people responsible for their choices is that they have agency. But maintaining agency requires the presence of some kind of material resources that would protect people from the fear and stress associated with poverty. Thus, responsibility-insensitive sufficientarianism is superior to luck sufficientarianism as an interpretation of the catastrophe clause. And within a libertarian framework, this requires introducing a basic income. First, a basic income technically guarantees everyone protection from extreme poverty and destitution. Second, a basic income guarantees everyone autonomy in how they manage their resources. Third, a basic income does not require means testing and is therefore responsibility-insensitive. Mack's catastrophe clause therefore offers a right-libertarian argument for a basic income.

AB This article attempts to establish the causes, trace the dynamics, and assess the significance of suicides that occurred in the Siberian and West Siberian regions between 1925 and 1937. The research is based on a diverse array of sources, including statistical compilations, minutes from meetings, resolutions from party, Soviet, and Komsomol bodies, reports from special commissions, administrative correspondence, and materials from periodical publications. Through a comprehensive analysis of this heterogeneous information, the article demonstrates an increase in the number of suicides in Siberia, elucidates the demographic and social-professional composition of those who voluntarily ended their lives, and identifies the methods employed as well as the most common reasons for suicide. These parameters are analyzed in comparison with similar indicators across the RSFSR and the USSR, revealing the presence of regional specificity. The article challenges the prevailing historiographical view that placed sole responsibility for suicides on the individuals themselves. It presents evidence that one significant avenue for combating suicides involved holding accountable those whose actions or inactions contributed to these tragic events. The conclusion drawn is that, despite failing to achieve tangible success in preventing suicides, the higher political leadership at both regional and provincial levels managed to create an illusion that this phenomenon had been entirely eradicated.

   delegitimation; power
ID HYPOTHESIS; HEADS
AB . The authors refer to the concept of hubris syndrome, introduced into political lexicon in the 2010s by D. Owen, and understood as a specific disease of "people of power." The hypothesis of the study is that the attribution of hubris syndrome to a leader by the media and within expert discourse is not based on objective criteria, but is manipulative in nature and is determined by the degree of "perverseness of the political course" in terms of its compliance or non-compliance with universal democratic values. The article reveals the mechanisms of delegitimization of power through the assignment of a number of characteristics to it within the framework of hubris syndrome. As the analysis shows, hubris syndrome is an exclusively political construction, which is broadcast to the general public as a medical concept. Arguments about hubris syndrome are always built on the basis of the oppositional pair "democracy - authoritarianism / tyranny", as it is understood that democratic regimes themselves, due to their immanent properties (multi-stage institutions of control, change of power, openness, etc.), usually prevent the development of hubris. Reversely, authoritarian and tyrannical regimes automatically turn out to be hubristic ones, which allows democratic regimes, by the right of moral superiority, to correct them in different ways that may even lead to intervention and interference. This scheme finds a historical analogy to the application of the concept of civilizational peoples and states in the civilization/barbarism dichotomy in the 18th-19th centuries, which played a similar function for the West, as described by S. Huntington. The discrepancy between the formal definition of hubris syndrome and the use of the concept in politics is obvious. A highly manipulative construct embodies the tactics of de-legitimization of a political leader if he/ she ceases to comply with the norms of a certain cultural and historical chronotope. The authors draw attention to the specific linguistic markers of hubris syndrome in political communication and the ways in which any politician whose speech contains these units can be declared suffering from hubris syndrome.

AB The slogan of "odemyanivanie", as a call to proletarian poets to learn from the poet and fable writer, agitator and propagandist D. Bedny was not a short-term campaign of the critics of the Association of Proletarian Writers, responding to the historical moment when the Association was looking for artistic ways to embody a new, properly proletarian content. The slogan of "odemyanivanie" accompanied proletarian critical thought for a whole decade, from 1923 to 1932, each time revealing a new educational, enlightening, ideological and political potential. In this way, Demyan Bedny's experience of working with the word was drawn into the sphere of literary struggle and political order, and the slogan itself changed its reference in response to the political and ideological peculiarities of the current time. From this perspective, the "odemyanivanie" slogan appears as a concentrated expression of the Association's literary policy during the years of its peak as well as in the moment of its decline.

DE Nikolay N. Strakhov; philosophy of science; Russian philosophy; science;

AB In the ongoing intellectual search for the "origins" and "beginnings" of the philosophy of science in Russia, one of the most significant is the return to texts written in the 19th century, when the philosophical and theoretical trends that determined the directions of development of non-classical epistemology in the 20th century had not yet emerged and finally stood out. At the same time, it is quite difficult for us today to strictly distinguish between the ideological trends of that time, separating the philosophy of science from ethics, and political philosophy from social philosophy. Russian philosophy of the 19th century was formed in the field of publicism and popular science literature, addressed to the entire educated reading public, and not to specialized audiences of philosophers, natural scientists, humanities scholars, etc., with in-depth semantic and thematic specialization. The article analyzes the philosophical and scientific content and significance of the book "On Eternal Truths (my dispute about spiritualism)", compiled by the famous Russian philosopher Nikolai Nikolaevich Strakhov from the materials of his polemics with spiritualist chemists published in literary and scientific periodicals. The formulation of questions about cognitive apriorism, about the external and internal limits of scientific rationality, about the role and place of empirical knowledge in the substantiation of theories and in solving applied practical problems, about the cultural and national specificity of intellectual traditions and prerequisites, about the reflection of epistemological attitudes in the categorical language of science and etc. are being identified. A conclusion is drawn about the relevance of Strakhov's approach for discussing the state and problems of modern philosophy and methodology of science.

AB In September 2018, deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation voted to raise the retirement age. At the same time, some parliamentarians from << United Russia >>, violating party discipline, did not support the so-called pension reform in one form or another. The purpose of this article is to obtain an empirically based answer to the research question: w hy did some deputies from the << United Russia >> faction support raising the retirement age, while others did not? What is the reason for the defection of << United Russia >> legislators? The relevance of the topic is due to the fact that << United Russia >> is the main political resource of the Russian president, the << party of power >> or the hegemonic party. The conceptual basis of the study was the concept of defection by legislators. The author defined this term as the deviation of parliamentarians from the line / decision of the party during the vote on the bill. Based on a number of theoretical approaches explaining the occurrence of defection by the legislature, the author formulated several working hypotheses: (1) older parliamentarians are more likely to desert than their younger counterparts; (2) << ordinary >> deputies are more likely to violate party discipline and desert than << status >> parliamentarians; (3) legislators elected in single- mandate constituencies are more likely to violate party discipline and desert than list deputies. The statistical method of data analysis was binary logistic regression. Three regression models were constructed in the article to explain the defection by parliamentarians when voting for raising the retirement age. Statistical calculations showed that none of the three working hypotheses found their empirical confirmation. To find an unaccounted factor, the author turned to the study of the genesis of the Russian << party of power >>. It is shown that << United Russia >> was created by com bining several political organizations - political movement << The Unity >>, electoral bloc << The Fatherland - All Russia >>, etc. After considering the specifics of the origins of the party, the author came to the conclusion that the party included members with different political views in its ranks. Much attention is paid to the existence of ideological clubs and platforms within the party. The article says that the decision taken by the party leadership to support the so- called "pension reformA- - 2018" did not correspond to the political attitudes of some of the deputies from << United Russia >>.

TI Religious Practices of Conflict Resolution in a Secularized Society of

ID MULTICULTURALISM; ARBITRATION
AB The practices of resolving conflict situations in religious associations are based on dogmatics and the unique historical experience of the formation of religious communities. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism have developed principles and norms for negotiation, mediation, arbitration and adjudication in the event of interpersonal, intra-group and intergroup conflicts between co-believers. Each tradition emphasizes different forms of dispute resolution: judging in Judaism, conciliation and mediation in Christianity, mediation and arbitration in Islam, and Buddhism, but they are all united by the desire for peaceful settlement, justice and non-violence. However, due to historical characteristics, ancient traditions do not always coincide with the requirements of modern society. The principles of equality of the parties, adversarial process, transparency, confidentiality and independency of mediators and judges are understood differently because of the supremacy of sacred institutions and the interests of the religious community. In this connection, forms of revival and integration of religious traditions of conflict resolution within a secularized society become relevant, including the increasing interest in "social values" by political elites in a number of countries (Great Britain, France, Russia). The interest of states, on the one hand, is social cohesion and respect for the law, and, on the other hand, the noticeable activization of religious communities which can complement the regulatory functions of the state, including eliminating contradictions between religious and secular norms, preventing violations of laws, discrimination and religious radicalism.

AB Introduction. The presidency of Emmanuel Macron during 2017-2023 was marked by the crisis of the regime of the Fifth Republic in France. The authors propose an analysis of the origins and development of this crisis. They emphasize the complex nature of the crisis, which is not opportunistic but systemic. Materials. The research is based on the data of sociological surveys, periodical materials, and electronic sources that allow us to characterize the course and current state of the political crisis of the regime of the Fifth Republic during the presidency of Emmanuel Macron, as well as the processes accompanying it. Analysis. The authors identify and analyze the manifestations of Gaullism as an anti-crisis strategy in the policy of E. Macron. The authors are describing and analyzing the growing political crisis under the leadership of E. Macron and the causes of his government failure. The authors compare the policy of E. Macron and the political strategy of Charles de Gaulle. Results. The authors conclude that E. Macron's selective use of elements of the Gaullist strategy in order to further legitimize and strengthen the regime of personal power does not bring final success and that French society's trust in the current government is gradually decreasing, which contributes to the deepening of the systemic crisis of the regime of the Fifth Republic. Authors' contribution. Ahmad Mulyadi prepared a material on the use of elements of Gaullism in the politics of E. Macron, S. V. Biryukov, and S. N. Chirun - on the political process and the crisis in France.

AB The analysis of markers and determinants of the current psychological state of Russian youth as a risk group with high probability of combined influence on its state of normative crisis of identity and complex external conditions is important and necessary. In the study we conducted a hierarchical regression analysis of the correlation between the severity of psychological trauma associated with the special military operation and with the perception of the future of Russia (dependent variables) and cultural and political patriotism and several control variables (predictors). University students from Moscow, Omsk, Penza, Saratov, Smolensk, Khabarovsk (718 Russian citizens ages 18 to 25, M=19,4; SD=1,46, 21,6% of men) participated in the study. Data were collected in October 2022. We used the Russian version of "International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ)" and questions from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP 2013). We found signs of psychological trauma in the third of respondents. The link between the psychological condition of students and cultural and political patriotism and some control variables has been revealed. Cultural patriotism, combined with a low level of political patriotism, has contributed to the psychological trauma of young people in the current crisis. Cultural patriotism combined with political patriotism is a factor of positiv perception of the future of Russia. Based on the results, we presented a portrait of student who is in great need of psychological help.

AB As a rule, the epidemics that took place on the Russian territory in the first quarter of the 20th th century were a part of the world epidemics that covered significant territories. Based on the materials of local newspapers, the reaction of the population towards current events and government actions is traced. The abundance of information and the range of periodicals which enable to trace the dynamic development of epidemics, statistics of diseases and public opinion about current events and activities is highlighted. The relevance of the topic is due, among other things, to the appeal to the socio-historical perspective of the problem of the mutual influence of power and society in extreme conditions on the example of the aggravation of epidemiological situation in the Far East during the period under review. Based on the archives introduced into scientific circulation, the management of sanitary affairs, historical aspects of the formation of the sanitary and epidemiological service, the implementation of measures to prevent and combat diseases are studied. The experience of Russian physicians in the fight against epidemics in the border territories is analyzed. From the point of view of the history of science the study of peripheral spaces having economic, cultural, strategic, and political forms is necessary for a historically reliable reconstruction of the policy of both the territory ready for epidemic challenges and the state. It is concluded that the analyzed epidemics have become a catalyst for changes in the concepts and practice of medicine, have changed the role of public health in the border areas. An important role in the fight against infectious diseases in the border territories of the Far East was played by the agitation activities of sanitary and epidemiological services, as well as sanitary, epidemiological and preventive measures.

AB This article focuses on the problems of epistemological aestheticization in Kantian philosophy, which consist in justifying the foundational role of aesthetic factors in cognitive activity. The paper argues for the inseparable connection between "transcendental aesthetics" and the critique of "judgment of taste", and defines the role of "transcendental dialectics" in grounding "aesthetic judgment". As a result, two foundational factors of Kantian epistemological aestheticization are identified. Firstly, the basic structures of our cognition, starting from elementary forms of intuition, largely contain aesthetic components. Secondly, in the epistemological sphere, the aesthetic factor reconciles heterogeneous cognitive abilities, ensuring a general harmony between the subjective and the objective. The relevance of Kantian aesthetic reflection is demonstrated through contemporary critical philosophy, philosophy of science, and the history of natural science.

DT Book Review
DE Great Britain; Russia; USA; Grand tour; history of tourism; travels
AB The historiography of modern tourism by the mid-2010s could not boast of the availability of fundamental comprehensive work, which had explored thoroughly this phenomenon on international scale. "A History of Modern Tourism" which was written by Eric Zuleow, an American professor of European and World History at the University of New England (Maine), is an ambitious attempt to examine the evolution of the formation of contemporary tourism formats over several centuries. Nevertheless, the idea to show a rise of global tourism is only partially implemented on the pages of the book. The reader, for the most part, deals with a Eurocentric view of the history of tourism. Some of the chapters, in particular focusing on the history of the 19th century, have an even narrower perspective. The author, first of all, focuses on the emergence of mass and popular tourism in Great Britain and the USA. The experience of Germany, Austria and Italy and other countries in that field has remained on the sidelines of the author's view. Meanwhile, a history of tourism in Russia has paid considerable attention in comparison with other European countries. Well aware of the limitations of his approach, Zuelow occasionally illustrates the history of the expansion of modern tourism with examples from a wide variety of countries, including non-European ones. Zuelow's main focus is on technological innovations and new business approaches that finally led to the creation of the mass tourism market.
   According to the author, a whole set of factors was important for the promotion of mass tourism: a new attitude to nature, the distribution of guide books among travelers, the improvement of trains and steamships in the second half of the XIX century. In the XX century, despite the global standards brought by the United States, tourism in many countries had its own specific. It depended, among others, on the type of political regime and cultural features of the country. In the second half of the 20th century, Western Europe managed to attract the attention of tourists from all over the world to its unique sights, while the USA turned into the main innovator of making the up-to-date leisure formats.
   The author managed to write a brief history of modern tourism, choosing the British Empire as a starting point. However, the vastness of the topic and the need to explore a variety of aspects of the history of modern tourism has resulted in uneven coverage of subject in some chapters as well as quite superficial study of mass tourism trends at the global level.

DE nostalgia; sacred core of culture; home; past; historical memory
AB Nostalgia is seen as an existential form of historical memory. It opens up in such existential aspects as returning home, to one's homeland, on the one hand, and pain, on the other. These meanings are reflected in the term recorded in European languages. Images of nostalgia are widely represented in non-specific forms of philosophizing: in literature, music, painting, cinema. Philosophy notes the illusory nature of nostalgic experiences fraught with disappointment (Immanuel Kant, Max Scheler), the ontological nature of longing for the whole and authentic (Martin Heidegger), and the desire to streamline being (Emmanuel Levinas). In the concept of nostalgia, what is fused together for the yearning person is not the home and the past as such, but the irretrievably lost home and the past associated with the origins of authenticity. The existential return is associated with the formation of a sense of home and is an ancient cultural practice, presented, for example, in the texts of the Old Testament and Russian chronicles. The focus of the house includes all forms of existence: nature, culture, society, people. Nature determines the material appearance of the house. Culture shapes everyday homemaking practices. Society constructs social roles in domestic life. A person, based on natural, cultural and social aspects, comprehends their identity within the confines of their home. The home neutralizes the destructive impact of social resentment. Turning to the origins of nostalgia means seeking consolation and strength to cope with today's trials. The past in a nostalgic vision is mythologized, symbolically saturated with the content of the core of culture, while being directly connected with the living present of a social group. The core of culture, according to the concept of Daniel Pivovarov, is a complex of unconditional ideals and values of a given culture, developed and sacralized in the process of cultural practices. The nostalgic past is significantly retouched; the transitory and the now insignificant are hidden in it. Unlike other forms of memory, nostalgia encourages symbolic return - the prospect of destruction of the cultural core means the death of the group. The existential nostalgia marks the search for essential meanings, reflection on the inauthenticity of what is happening. Working with memory involves maximizing the deepening of knowledge about one's past over the centuries. The longer a people exists, the stronger its cultural foundations, hence the desire of historically young communities to connect their historical roots with ancient ethnic groups and to romanticize and glorify existing, sometimes controversial, pages of their own history.

ID ENGAGEMENT
AB The article presents the results of a study of the involvement of managers and employees in a Russian high-tech company. The features of organizational culture, its role and significant characteristics that contribute to increasing employee loyalty and engagement are shown. These characteristics are indicators of the effectiveness of organizational culture and a positive work environment. The role of organizational culture in the success of a company has been confirmed by global research, but, nevertheless, there are very few studies of the organizational culture of high-tech enterprises in world practice. The authors rely on classical and modern works on organizational culture and the phenomenon of engagement by domestic and foreign authors. The empirical basis is a study of managers and engineering and technical staff of a Tomsk high-tech company (big business) with a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The work focuses on the study of the image of the organization that exists in the minds of employees, the general atmosphere, culture, loyalty and employee engagement. The authors propose concepts that make it possible to concretize the concept of engagement and present typologies of managers and employees. Strict separation of the active position of employees into "supportive engagement" and "developing engagement" can give an understanding of what and how to deal with the leaders of the culture being created. In the first case, it is possible to work on setting global goals and defining a mission, working with values; in the second, on developing a dialogue space with other equal-minded colleagues, forming working groups structuring the company's mission, forming a future image, etc. Narratives about managers at different levels should strengthen a common "mythology", unite in common intentions, create a mission "from below." In general, the study demonstrates once again that the mission and purpose of the company, culture should be integrated not only into the formal structures and practices of the organization. If an organization is metaphorically considered as an integral human body, then it becomes obvious that its image, meanings and values, "mythology" determine a lot and create the basis for harmonious development both within the company and in its interaction with the outside world.

AB Introduction. The "critical turn" in modern humanities and social sciences has led researchers to rethink the contemporary global processes in terms of the inclusion/exclusion of actors in accepted narratives. The "women's question" and "the voice of the subalterns" represent only a small part of hotly debated topics in academia and in the public sphere. Research on the memory of the traumatic past in European countries is also highly topical due to the fact that when faced with modern challenges, the European Union is trying to "reassemble" its identity and declare itself as a global player, an actor with unity and certain "common values," among which is shared memory of the past. Methods and materials. Through comprehensive analysis of recent research on the memory of colonialism in European countries, four countries are compared: France, Great Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Analysis. A group of factors is identified that influence the perception of the past and its representation in urban places, in public discussions, on television, in mass culture, etc. Such factors include, in particular, the presence of a large and organized diaspora from the former colonies, the spread of modern technologies, the activities of veterans' and former settlers' associations, the interest of the younger generation in their past, etc. Results. As the study shows, the memory of the past continues to be a complex and contradictory phenomenon in the cultural and political life of European countries. Official discourses of memory are constantly challenged by actors who disagree with the interpretation of past events. The process of accepting the tragic past is not always accompanied by concrete measures, such as the payment of reparations, ceremonies to commemorate the victims of atrocities, memorial days, etc., and among the population there is still nostalgia for the colonial past.

TI Historical memory in Okinawa Prefecture: Regional specifics
SO JAPANESE STUDIES IN RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Okinawa; historical memory; victimhood; memorials; domestic politics;
   historical grievances
AB Okinawa Prefecture takes a special place among Japan's regions. Until the 19th century, its territory was occupied by the Kingdom of Ryukyu, which was dependent on and influenced by both Japan and China. In 1879, it was incorporated into the Japanese Empire and for a long time was a de- facto colony. In 1945, the island of Okinawa became the arena of fierce ground fighting, which claimed the lives of almost 200,000 people. The article studies the most widespread narrative about the history of the prefecture and, particularly, the tragedy of World War II. It shows that, in the pre-war period, the status of Okinawans in the Japanese Empire was ambiguous. On the one hand, from the point of view of Japanese authorities and Japanese society as a whole, they were separate from the residents of the rest of the country, which was solidified both by the economic backwardness of the region and the fact that, in terms of the administrative and political system, its status was different from that of other prefectures even several decades after the annexation. On the other hand, it is shown that Okinawans were not necessarily considered a separate people and were often perceived as a "branch" of the Japanese. In this sense, their status was radically different from that of the people of Taiwan and Korea. Such an ambiguous status of Okinawans in the public discourse of Japan before 1945 influenced the way in which, in the postwar period, they were perceiving the experience of World War II. Memorials and other commemorative objects promote the narrative according to which Okinawans were only and exclusively victims of the war, with key culprits of their suffering often being not even Americans or the abstract "calamity of war," but rather the Japanese military. This narrative continues to define the identity of Okinawans to this day, influencing their attitude to central authorities, the Japan-U.S. military-political alliance, and the problem of U.S. bases in Okinawa.

AB In the first decades of the XXI century, the problem of vulnerability has become the subject of social sciences, including social and political theory in connection with the "affective turn" and the growth of social, political and economic instability. Representatives of feminist moral and political philosophy, revealing vulnerability as a universal and fundamental human trait, have played a significant role in its comprehension. The article explicates the concept of vulnerability as an ontological state of interdependence in the bodily ontology proposed by American philosopher Judith Butler and critically analyzes the relevance of deducing ethical and political obligations from this ontology. To solve this problem, the method of conceptual analysis is used, which allows to reveal the conceptual content of the key categories of Butler's bodily ontology. The first part of the article is devoted to the consideration of Butler's relational bodily ontology and its connection with the ethical and political reflections of the philosopher, for which two levels are distinguished: ontological and social. The second part analyzes three key categories of Butler's proposed ontology: interdependence, vulnerability and precariousness. The application of these concepts in the philosopher's criticism of liberal ideas about the subject as an autonomous, sovereign and independent individual is described. Finally, the third part analyzes Butler's arguments on the justification of the ethics of nonviolence through an appeal to states of vulnerability and interdependence. Based on the analysis, the author comes to the conclusion that the ethics of nonviolence for Butler is a means of problematizing these ontological states in order to support political egalitarianism and refute liberal views about man as an individual; The bodily ontology developed by Butler can become a successful theoretical tool both for the criticism of established ideas about social subjectivity and for the study of the fundamental foundations of the existence of society, which remain invisible from the standpoint of individualistic views on man.

AB In the modern world, there is an increase in global problems that manifest themselves in different ways at the local level. In this regard, the question of how local communities cope with the consequences of global changes becomes relevant. In search of an answer, scientists turned to the study of factors affecting the ability of communities to withstand external influences and recover from them. The results of the research led to the emergence of the concept of social resistance, according to which both internal and external resources affect the resilience of communities. The resources include the natural, social, and cultural features of the territory where people live, which create an emotional connection between people and places. Scientists believe that in the face of global challenges, a sense of place is one of the factors that contribute to the adaptation of communities to external changes. However, to test this hypothesis, research is needed to establish the impact of a sense of place on society's ability to withstand various challenges. In this regard, the aim of the study is to substantiate the role of a sense of place in the formation of social resilience, taking into account local contexts. To reach the aim, sociological studies were conducted in rural settlements of Primorsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast. During in-depth interviews with villagers, two tasks were solved: (1) identifying the factors that contribute to the formation of a sense of place among local residents and (2) finding out whether a sense of place and attachment to a place affects the ability of the local population to adapt to external changes. The results of the study confirmed that local residents have a sense of place, indicators of which are Pomeranian identity, natural and socio-cultural capital, and close ties between residents. It turned out that the sense of place of rural residents, formed by the community of the territory of residence and the similarity of everyday life practices, contributes to better adaptation to external changes and carries the potential for transformation. The initiators of these transformations are activists from among local residents who develop the cultural potential of the territories, creating new opportunities for self-development of villages.

AB The article examines to the history of the well-known ideologeme of the Leonid Brezhnev era - the concept of "developed socialist society" (or "developed socialism"). The author considers the role and effectiveness of this concept in the Soviet socio-political thought of that time. The aim of the study is to analyze the historical and theoretical circumstances of the discovery and implementation of the new ideologeme, and also explores the tasks that Soviet ideologists set when testing and introducing the new concept. One of the most important reasons for the introduction of the new concept was the need to correct the controversial provision of the Third Program of the CPSU on the construction of a communist society in the USSR during the lifetime of people of a given generation. The conceptual collisions of the theory of developed socialism, which was formed by Soviet scientists and ideologists, are revealed. The essence of the main circumstance was that the concept of developed socialism (this phrase is found on the pages of the works of Vladimir Lenin) was found by Marxist ideologists of socialist countries, and then was used by Soviet ideologists to conceptually replace the promise to build communism by the time around 1980, which was obviously unenforceable. The focus of special attention is the original interpretation of the concept of developed socialism in the works of the famous Soviet theorist, ideologist and politician Richard Kosolapov. He focuses on the rapprochement of classes during the period of developed socialism, which, in his opinion, already within the framework of the stage of developed socialism reaches such a level that it will be possible to raise the question of a classless society. However, since the theoretical construction of a classless society within the current phase of the development of socialism carried risks for the Marxist-Leninist theory of the socialist state theory, Richard Kosolapov's concept did not receive support from his colleagues. Summarizing the study, the author comes to the conclusion that the concept of developed socialism in the form developed by the end of the 1970s corresponded to the tasks set by Soviet ideologists. This concept was theoretically and ideologically successful. It was elegant from the point of view of propaganda, since it represented the USSR in a representative and status way as the leader of the countries of the world socialist community.

ID ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB Based on the text of M. Mikeshin's article, the author discusses how one can adjust the optics of epistemological reading of the article to see meta-scientific and cultural problems in a technoscientific text. The approaches developed within the STS (science and technology studies) field can help in this. STS point to the dependence of explanatory models of nature on specific epistemic cultures, and problematize the position of technological determinism, revealing a complex and contingent structure of interaction between nature, society, knowledge and technology. Laboratory studies (B. Latour, S. Woolgar, K. Knorr-Cetina) pointed to the prominence of literature in scientific work and showed that text of a scientific paper is a form of representation of the universe and mythology of a given scientific group or school. The concept of "sociotechnical imaginaries" (Sh. Jasanoff) allows us to analyze how values and perceptions of the desired future are embodied in the design of technological systems and principles of science and technology policy. The related concept of "energy imaginaries" is used to explore the specificity of national energy systems and the relationship of material configurations of infrastructure to the culture and political imagination of a community. Analyzing the visual material of scientific papers allows us to "unpack" the specificity of models that represent a stable picture of scientific knowledge. STS methodological settings can help to investigate a set of contextual aspects and meta- problems that are present in a technoscientific text, even without being explicitly included by the author - they are the result of conventions accepted in the respective scientific or regional community, correlate with the horizon of national or social perceptions and objectives. The power of epistemological reading of the article is thus expressed in the problematization of obviousness, revealing the correlation of sociocultural contexts with technoscientific ways of describing the world.

The ideas of Valery Surovtsev, Vsevolod Ladov, Vitaly Ogleznev, Nikolay Tarabanov, and others are considered. The first part of the article highlights the institutional and theoretical positions of the Tomsk School of Analytic Philosophy. The School is distinguished by the following characteristics: the presence of a consolidated group of leading representatives with a pronounced institutional organization, holding of annual conferences, a full range of research work, participation in grant projects, training of young specialists at all levels. There are three priority areas of theoretical activity of Tomsk School: logic, epistemology, and philosophy of law. The Tomsk School has formulated leading approaches to evaluating the ideas of the classics of analytic philosophy. Realism can be distinguished as the basic ideological and theoretical setting of the School (in various forms: Valery Surovtsev's logical realism, Vsevolod Ladov's formal realism, Evgeny Borisov's phenomenological realism, Vitaly Ogleznev's legal realism). In the second part, it is noted that the Tomsk School is the leading one in the field of publishing Russian-language literature on analytic philosophy, which includes a full range of creative work with texts (translations, editing, commentaries). The following results were obtained during the study. (1) It is shown that a synthesis of all types of work with a foreign analytic text (translation, editing, commenting) is achieved, which is a unique practice of research work in Russian analytic philosophy. (2) It is demonstrated that introductory articles (forewords, afterwords) aim to critically analyze the translated texts. (3) A reconstruction is proposed for the first time in the literature, according to which the editorial work of representatives of the Tomsk School can be considered as a specific scientific discourse that significantly complements monographic and periodical publications. (4) Representatives of the Tomsk School demonstrate a unified approach in this field of work from the standpoint of realism and criticism of anti-realist teachings, which does not exclude a polemical attitude to the translated texts. As a result, textual interpretations emerge that are essential for understanding the problems of analytic philosophy.

AB The article continues the authors' thoughts about the necessary conceptual frameworks that would help rural sociology provide more reliable insights and data in the study of such a relatively new (in the conceptual-analytical perspective) social phenomenon as rural human capital. In the previous article, we presented a brief overview of such half-forgotten but still relevant theoretical foundations of rural sociology as agricultural economics, theories of peasant agrarianism, and theory of rural-urban continuum, which to a greater or lesser extent can be applied in the analysis of rural development and rural social and human capital. In this article, we provide a brief overview of some more recent agrarian ideas that seem to have sufficient but questionable heuristic potential for rural sociology. First, the idea and repeatedly tested projects of the Green Revolution, or the Third Agricultural Revolution, which implied technology transfer initiatives to greatly increase crop yields, opposed the concept of "Red Revolution" (comprehensive agrotechnological transformations instead of radical political ones), despite some skeptical assessments, in the last decades of the 20thcentury contributed to the reduction in global hunger, and, especially in its Soviet interpretations, seemed to be consonant with the more recent intellectual direction - development studies. Second, Peasant Studies defending the position that the very question about the need for a special theory of the peasantry and peasant societies is untenable, and presenting an attempt to develop a middle-range theory within historical sociology, which is based on the four most important characteristics of the peasantry in the past and present: family economy, work on land in interaction with nature, local culture of self-organization (rural community), and marginal role in relation to the state. Today's disputes about the peasantry in the contemporary world are complemented by two macro-concepts - theory of international food regimes and theory of global rural development. Thus, we still miss unambiguous theoretical generalizations regarding rural development due to the extreme diversity of both rural areas (and their social/human capital) and interpretations/definitions of rural/agricultural development (for instance, deagrarianization and extractivism or rural-urban glocalization and optimistic "unorthodox" social-ecological model)

AB The article studies the process of using the events of the Great Patriotic War in the practice of state domestic loan campaigns in the USSR in 1946-1957. On the basis of the analysis of data obtained from information reports on the mood of citizens and the conduct of loan campaigns, letters of citizens to public authorities, statesmen, as well as materials of the Soviet mass media (periodicals, texts of microphone broadcasts of radio broadcasts) conclusions are drawn about the use of events and consequences of the Great Patriotic War in the process of preparation and conduct of postwar mass loan campaigns. Special attention is paid to the reflection of the experience of the Leningrad blockade in these campaigns. In the course of the analysis of documents and information from the mass media it was established that the destruction caused by the Nazi invaders was a powerful illustration in the argumentation of convincing citizens to participate in subscription campaigns and to maintain a sense of involvement in the construction of the state throughout the entire period of mass loans after 1945. Drawing citizens' attention to the reconstruction of the state and social infrastructure gave the loan campaigns a topical character. The universality of anti-war rhetoric made it possible to appeal to it until the loans were canceled in 1957, and even the decision to cancel earlier promised payments was commented on through an appeal to the sacrificial war experience. Reflection on the experience of the blockade took place within the framework of the loan subscription rallies; the periodical press and radio paid considerably less attention to it, not singling out these events as the most tragic. However, the use of such experience allowed to continue the use of mobilization economic methods, conditioning their objective necessity for the speedy restoration of the national economy. The task of state argumentation consisted in the development of correct political behavior, for the achievement of which any available means were used. At the same time, the appeal to the military experience became a way to intensify the dialog between the state and society on significant socio-economic issues. The objective consequences of the war and the need to rebuild the state infrastructure were not questioned by the citizens of the USSR, but the ways and methods of implementation provoked not always positive public reaction. Wartime events and lived experience allowed to express emotions, but the reasons for their emergence should not be attributed exclusively to the campaigns, but to the general state of life in the USSR after the war.

TI PHILOSOPHY OF PUNISHMENT: THE CAPACITY OF COMPROMISE THEORIES
SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO
   UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY
   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA Russian
DT Article
DE punishment; crime; utilitarianism; retributivism; consequentialism
AB The article presents the study of the nature and structure of compromise (mixed or hybrid) theories of punishment justification. It explores the foundational elements of retributivism and consequentialism upon which these theories are based, as well as their respective advantages and disadvantages. Despite their varying forms, compromise theories share two essential components: the "general justifying aim" of punishment (e.g., crime prevention, reform, retribution, etc.) and restrictive means (e.g., prohibiting the punishment of the innocent, preventing excessive punishment of the guilty). These elements serve as the basis for differentiating between these theories and must be present in all such theories, functioning as their unifying feature. While the content of these components may differ, their presence in these theories is necessary. The article examines three prominent compromise theories in modern philosophy of punishment: (1) H.L.A. Hart's Two-Element Theory of Punishment. Hart was the first to attempt to reconcile consequentialism and retributivism. He argued that the focus should not be on how punishment is defined (as retribution or as crime prevention), but rather on how the concept is used to answer key questions such as the "general justifying aim" of punishment, the reasons for punishing someone, and the distribution of punishment (e.g., who can be punished and how severely). (2) Robert Nozick's Correct-Values Retributivism. Nozick's understanding of punishment is rooted in the idea that by committing a crime, the offender deviates from the pursuit of "correct values". Punishment, therefore, is aimed at returning the offender to this moral path. (3) Antony Duff's Liberal-Community Retributivism. Duff's approach is based on a modified version of the general retributivist principle, positing that punishment serves to express the deserved condemnation of the offender while also promoting their repentance, reform, and reconciliation with the victims. However, many contemporary punishment theorists are increasingly moving away from mixed theories in favor of either retributivism or consequentialism. This shift is not so much due to the inability of compromise theories to provide convincing answers, but rather because the separate consideration of punishment justification and the restrictive means of its implementation (the two elements of Hart's theory) does not necessarily require a hybrid understanding of punishment.

TI Economic and managerial ethics of Soviet enterprise managers in the
   1930s-1940s. Based on sources of personal origin
SO HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Economic-managerial ethics; Russian economy; enterprise leaders;
   Stalinist era; personal origin sources; management principles;
   centralized command
AB This article, for the first time in domestic historiography, scrutinizes the ethical principles guiding the managerial activities of directors in Russian enterprises during the 1930s and 1940s. To address this issue, a selection was made from sources of personal origin, consisting of expressions concerning the principles of managerial ethics, followed by a structured description of these principles. The study employs historical-comparative and historical-genetic methods. The significance of the economic-ethical aspect of the soviet leaders mentality allows for a fresh understanding of the genesis of the soviet elite and its role in the transformation of the socio-economic structure of the country. Furthermore, the examination of the labor ethics of soviet leaders based on personal origin sources is undertaken by the author for the first time in historiography. Additionally, the article introduces a novel approach by applying a systematic structuring method to the managerial-ethical principles of enterprise leadership. The study of managerial ethics is conducted based on personal origin sources, such as memoirs and diaries of enterprise directors. The primary portion of the source complex is extracted from the archives of the Russian State Archive of Economics (memoirs of A. L. Kozlov, A. M. Kontorshchikov, Yu. N. Kozhevnikov, and the diary of M. V. Yasvoin), the majority of which remain unpublished and minimally incorporated into scholarly discourse. The methodological foundation for studying these sources is rooted in A. Rikh's works on the understanding of economic ethics, as well as contemporary Russian historians works on new property relations in the soviet economy of the 1930s to the early 1950s. The author concludes that the fundamental ethical principles adhered to by enterprise leaders in their managerial activities consisted of an << oath >> to the fundamental postulates of soviet authority and the requirements formulated by the state. The leaders deemed the principles of centralized command and personal labor participation in enterprise affairs as correct. Regarding moral norms of management, the leaders considered personal gain, nepotism, and favoritism, among other practices, as unacceptable. However, the principles of economic-labor ethics identified through published sources do not encompass the latent stratum of the soviet economic model, where deviations from certain economic-ideological norms, disregard for subordinates, << everyday >> norms of managerial material support, etc., were deemed acceptable. The article concludes that a significant portion of soviet enterprise leaders in the 1930s and 1940s adhered to the proposed soviet ideological system of ethical values, striving to uphold and cultivate << socialist >> ethical parameters.

The article defines the conclusion of pluridimensionality, dynamism and trend chasing of the << strong state >> concept, its complication, reassessment in the frameworks of new historical conditions, submission of new meaning in postmodern political discourse, shifting emphasis from physical and material manifestations of power to subjective components, including the ability to use historical experience and traditions in the solution process of governmental issues, preserving traditional values, national and state identity.

AB Historical memory is one of the key problems in contemporary philosophy of his-tory, political philosophy, and social philosophy. Philosophers and humanitiesscholars discuss its possible specific characteristics based on the contexts of theirfields of knowledge, but the contentiousness of this phenomenon persists despitetheir intellectual efforts. To identify new contexts for interpreting historical me-mory and to reveal new perspectives for understanding its modes of existenceinculture and society, the authors turn to the history of Russian philosophy,within which a unique attitude towards history as a fundamental basis of humani-tarian knowledge was formulated (unlike the Western tradition of the philosophyof science, where history is generally treated as a relativizing factor). The focusofthe authors is on the intellectual legacy of the Russian philosopher NikolaiNikolaevich Strakhov, whose concept of the philosophy of science and under-standing opens up new opportunities for interpreting "historical memory".The authors immerse the problem of historical memory in the following contextsof Strakhov's philosophy: 1) science as a cultural phenomenon, 2) ethnic psycho-logy, and 3) existential themes that reveal the specificity of communicationamong 19th-century Russian philosophers, their methods of preserving histo-ricalmemory, and transmitting its meanings to future generations. Special at-tention is given to two different interpretations of the concept of "experience"inN.N. Strakhov's philosophy (as the empirical basis of scientific research and as"life experience" aimed at expanding the horizon of understanding reality)

DE peaceful atom; Cold War; propaganda; nuclear ethics; nuclear sublime;

AB The article discusses the rhetorical, political and ethical entanglements of the atomic age, embodied into a new understanding of the world, as well as into new fragilities and responsibilities. The author notes the epistemological challenges of exploring the discursive production of the peace in the USSR, which is identified as one of the most indoctrinated practices of late socialism. Through the lens of a single slogan, the author analyzes the indirect transitions between ethics and propaganda. The statement "Let the atom be a worker, not a soldier", which appeared on the banners of demonstrators in the late 1950s and early 1960s and was attributed to the atomic supervisor Igor Kurchatov, became a Soviet atomic imperative and a key figure in the discourse of (post)Soviet atomic peacefulness. The author describes the figuration of the slogan in the context of the confrontation between two systems, nuclear diplomacy and the establishment of a global agenda for the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The USSR participated in this struggle by promoting the significance of the peaceful atom and defending its moral priority in the propaganda of this brand. The author focuses on the authorship of the statement and reveals its entanglement with the genealogy of morality and the development of an ethical position for a Soviet nuclear scientist between nuclear war and the peaceful atom. The article pays attention to the contribution of the science journalist Vladimir Gubarev to the retrospective restoration of the authorship of the Soviet atomic imperative. By creating this discursive fiction, one of the main chroniclers of the Sredmash project simultaneously engaged in both propaganda and ethical work.

The concept "family chronotope" is introduced, which differs from the official historical canon of the "host country", and in many ways opposes it. It is assumed that the "points of intersection" between the "family chronotope" of immigrants and the symbolic space of the "new homeland" may arise as a result of interest of "newcomers" in local lore knowledge and objects. This interaction can create new "places of memory" for immigrants that are also shared by local residents.

AB The escalation of the military and political struggle between Russia and the West, which has led to the near-total collapse of the arms control system, has now extended to outer space, the 'sixth ocean'. In the current year 2024, American rhetoric has become especially active, accusing Russia of attempting to turn space into 'a battlefield of the future'. Another surge in suspicion, amid a sharp escalation of tensions, has occurred due to the lack of effective legal mechanisms to reliably regulate the activities of states in space. In the past, the Soviet Union and the United States, after a series of costly projects aimed at attempts to use outer space for warfare, redirected their activities towards non-military, peaceful purposes. They created a solid legal framework and moved towards cooperative relations, including in the outer space. In light of the current, largest military and political crisis between Russia and the Western countries since the end of the Cold War, new cooperative efforts are needed to strengthen collective security in outer space.

TI Nation and Ethnos: The Nonlinear Evolution of Ethnological Concepts in

DT Article
DE nonlinear evolution; nation; nationality; ethnos; ethnicity; ethnography
AB This article analyzes changes in the basic concepts of ethnology, i.e., nation, ethnos, and their derivatives (nationality, ethnicity, ethnography, and ethnology) over two centuries of historical observations in Russia. It demonstrates the fluctuating character of the evolution of the concept of nation in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation. The concept originated as a political concept, then acquired an ethnic meaning, and in the post -Soviet era, its political content manifested once again. As the concept of nation is gradually losing its ethnic meaning, the concept of ethnos is regaining relevance for denoting ethnocultural communities. However, the new terminology struggles to penetrate everyday, public, and academic discourses. In official Russian documents, the traditional ethnic interpretation of the concept of nation is preserved and intertwined with the political one. In Russian and Soviet academia, the concept of ethnos at times took on a predominant role in ethnographic theory, while at other times it was viewed as undesirable. In everyday discourse, the civic meaning of nation is hardly accepted. The author analyzes the political, psychological, and cultural circumstances that prevent or promote the assertion of ethnological concepts and offers his own definitions of the concepts of nation, ethnos, and ethnicity based on a synthesis of the latest developments in social anthropology.

DE pandemic; political space; nation state; subsidiarity; distribution of

AB The article considers the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the spatial structure of the global political space. To the date, political theory in this field was dominated by the idea of the nation state gradual demise in favour of international and global regimes. The article provides empirical evidence questioning this thesis at the international and domestic levels. It discovers omnipresent collisions between the demand for a global comprehensive response to the pandemic challenge and the materiality of state-driven practices of spatial control over security competencies, territorialization industries within state domains, territorial control over population, which bring the states back into the centre of the political structure in the international arena. The article further investigates the processes of emergency power-sharing at the sub-national level. It shows that the transfer of powers (devolution) to the regional and municipal level has become a representative global trend within the pandemic. Due to this empowerment regions and municipalities get the possibility to implement both pragmatic and political agendas. Yet the political programmes stay reserved and only in rare cases provide for increasing regional political autonomy within the pandemic. The relevant experience in the Russian Federation is analyzed, it is shown that the regional variation in the response to the crisis did not lead to the politicization of the transfer of powers to the regions. The factors are identified that made it possible to avoid politicization of this process: the lack of regional legitimacy to cope with the pandemic and the lack of popular support, infrastructural and financial deficits at regional and municipal levels. In this vein, the article proposes that powers be transferred to the subnational level endorsed for the concentration of political leadership at the level of nation states. It posits that the principal organizational trace of the pandemic is the regaining of the nation states' centrality.

AB The article analyzes the foreign policy of Abe Shinz & omacr;, one of the most notable and unusual political figures of contemporary Japan, who was twice the head of Japanese government for a total of almost nine years. It traces how his political philosophy formed under the influence of ideological views of his relatives, prime ministers N. Kishi and E. Sato, as well as his father, Abe Shintar & omacr;. It also considers Abe's approaches to building Japan's relations with the countries which are most important for its interests. S. Abe was perceived as a devoted ally of the U.S. in Washington. He established relations of confidence with presidents Obama and Trump. For this purpose, he strengthened Japanese-American military-political cooperation, took steps to support American strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. He implemented, even if without substantial results, steps to stabilize relations with China, trying to combine policy of containing Beijing with efforts to develop bilateral ties. Abe paid substantial attention to relations with India, including for the purpose of the idea, which was put forward by him and supported by the U.S., to establish quadrilateral cooperation of "democracies" in the Indo-Pacific region - the U.S., Japan, India, and Australia. His policy on the Korean direction was not successful. The relations with Pyongyang remained in deadlock, and, with Seoul, the most acute bilateral problems were not finally solved. Abe also paid great attention to policy aiming to conclude a peace treaty with Russia on the basis of a radical improvement of Japanese-Russian ties in all spheres. The reasons for his failure in these directions are discussed in this article. The article evaluates Abe's efforts aimed at developing governmental documents and making the Diet adopt laws determining the basic directions of the foreign and military policy of the state. The author characterizes the results of the activity of S. Abe in the sphere of foreign policy and assesses its influence on the formation of the course of the Japanese government after his resignation.

DE history of Byzantium; early Palaiologian period; naval battle at

AB Introduction. The author proposes a new reconstruction of the military-political conditions for the organization of the Thessalian campaign of John Palaiologos, as well as the major naval battle in the history of the Late Byzantine Empire that took place during it. The warfare between the Latin and Byzantine fleets at Demetrias is of interest due to the possibility of battle practice analysis in the context of the formation of the early Palaiologian military-strategic concept and the development of late Byzantine military art in general. Methods. The methodological basis of the work is the critical use of elements of systemic approaches. It should be noted that the system approach allows us to reveal the role and level of mutual influence of political and socio-economic factors that determined the specifics of military organisation and the development of military science and battle practice. Analysis and results. After the renewal of the church union discussion, hoping for the support of Clement IV in the war of the anti-imperial forces, the Byzantines organized a new large-scale campaign in Thessaly. In the spring of 1273, the army of many thousands was sent there. An analysis of the sources that reported detachments about the second stage of the campaign showed that along with the decision to send the French knights to Neopatras, the Lombard barons of Euboea began to form a flotilla. The purpose of the squadron being formed was to inflict a crushing defeat on Byzantium at sea. The reconstruction of the battle at Demetrias showed that the Byzantines were not prepared for the naval battle that had begun. This was due to the fact that the fleet under the command of Philanthropenos, within the framework of the Thessalian campaign, only an auxiliary role was assigned. It could equally act as a cover for the land forces from potential assistance from the Euboean barons and also be used to reshuffle a large land contingent to the area of the main warfare. The analysis of the naval battle showed that the Byzantine army's military successes were based not only on the talent of the commanders who commanded the military troops during the period of the military organization degradation. In such a significant battle, the defeat of which the entire imperial fleet was threatened with destruction, Philanthropenos's squadron won thanks to professional training and combat experience, which was based on knowledge of Byzantine polemology. The outcome of the battle was influenced by the composition and number of the ground forces involved, as well as the use of stratagems.

AB The paper is a reflection on the first part of duology (two inextricably linkedparts of one work) entitled "Soviet" by the Russian social philosopher SergeiNikolsky. In the second part of duology, Nikolsky offers a philosophical analysisof Soviet literature, or rather a philosophical and literary analysis of the ideaofthe "Soviet". The first part is devoted to the historiosophy of the "Soviet".Therefore, the author of the review, to illuminate the author's intention, focuseson the first volume and mainly writes about the preconditions of the "Soviet"that Sergei Nikolsky discovers in Russian history. The uniqueness of the "So-viet" consists primarily in the unexpected vitality of the idea, the originalityofthe social practice corresponding to it and the specific creative totality. "So-viet" is not only Leninism and Stalinism, but a socio-political adaptationofMarxism to a special historically determined context, the "Russian soil". Thisis also a political and philosophical project to reform personal social conscious-ness, to create a new person and to build a new world. The source of the "So-viet" were the leaders and the state apparatus, but it appeared first in the headsofMarxist-oriented intellectuals, and then produced by the people as a wholeand existed thanks to them and deeply-rooted tradition. Sergei Nikolsky admitsthat the "Soviet" had both the humanistic and liberating potential of the philoso-phy of Karl Marx. Thus, the "Soviet" is the idea of the comprehensive develop-ment of man, the construction of a future brotherhood, as well as the heroismshown by the people during the Great War. The author of the paper also writeson the special tonality of the "Soviet", finding it successful.

DE epistemic logic; logical omniscience; situational semantics
ID PERCEPTION
AB Utterances of the subject's intentional states were analyzed in the second half of the 20th century by researchers of epistemic logic. This approach was unable to complete the solution of the problem of logical omniscience because the subject of utterances does not always know all the consequences of their knowledge in everyday life. Sometimes the subject is convinced that contradictory utterances are true. In this way, epistemic logic idealizes the position of the subject in the analysis of utterances and, moreover, fixes them in one state. Because of this, the subject cannot expand and supplement their knowledge, because they already know all the logical consequences of utterances at the same time. This issue can be solved remaining within the framework of epistemic logic. In this case we have to weaken the subject's cognitive potential for that, and, moreover, we have to take into account the subjective nature of utterances. This approach is based on the analysis of the implicit knowledge of the subject. So, it is important to pay attention on the object of utterances because the perceiver's attention is directed to it. In this regard, the author considers the analysis of utterances of intentional states of subject in situational semantics. Due to the latter, we take into account situations that the subject has in mind, and, moreover, we consider situations independently of the agent, based on the information provided by the context. It is semantics based on how the world, not the subject's utterances about mental representations, such as knowledge, beliefs, etc., works. In this case, the information is part of the context; it exists independently of the subject and is extracted by them for further transformation into utterances. Also, situational semantics considers the object, which helps to learn more about the ontological aspect of this problem. This is due to the fact that the information that helps us analyze an utterance exists in situations, not in the subject's attitudes. The author concludes that situational semantics appears to be a more universal method in the logical-semantic analysis of utterances of the subject's intentional states, as compared to epistemic logic, because it allows us to consider various types of information of an utterance, not only that which corresponds to the propositional content.

AB At the end of the last century and at the beginning of this century, a number of historical and methodological papers was published on the ideological and political campaigns that took place in the USSR in the late 1940s and early 1950s. This article continues this historical and scientific line. It examines an ideological attack on one of the early quantum chemical theories, the theory of resonance, which took place in Soviet science in the 1949-1951's (more broadly, the expression "antiresonance campaign" can be rewritten as follows: "a campaign to fight against idealism in quantum chemistry" or "the struggle for ideological correctness of Soviet quantum chemistry"), provides an overview of the literature on the history of criticism of chemical and physical theories in the course of these ideological and political campaigns and highlights two ideological dominants of these campaigns: the struggle against physical idealism and the struggle against so-called cosmopolitanism. It is noted that the anti-resonance campaign followed other ideological, or better to say ideological-political, events conducted by the leadership of the Soviet Union. The campaign is also interesting as a cultural phenomenon of the late Stalinist era with its bizarre symbiosis of scientific, rational and mystical values. It allows us to better understand the situation in Soviet natural science, which used ideological rhetoric and nevertheless retained creative potencies, as well as why quantum chemistry, which included the theory of resonance, was not defeated like genetics, why it, having lost pace of development, was preserved as a scientific area.

DE spiritual and political thought; traditional values; silence; spiritual

AB The article is devoted to one of the basic categories of Russian spiritual and political thought- silence. Silence defined both a certain spiritual state and a socio-political ideal that rulers should be guided by in their activities. However, over time, the meanings of this concept have changed, depending on the context, some of its semantic aspects have come to the fore. In this regard, it is important to trace the semantic content of silence, the origin of this concept in Russian thought and its development at an early stage. For this purpose, a content analysis of the preserved Russian texts of the pre-Mongol period was carried out, the specifics of word usage were highlighted, and the author's scheme of the content and development of the concept was proposed. It was found out that at this stage silence meant a state of peace, non-interference from outside in the internal affairs of Russia, a time of creative work and peaceful existence under the protection of God, which became especially important after the establishment of the Horde yoke.

AB The paper analyzes the story of the history of Omsk city self-government, associated with the attempt to approve a new public holiday in antiBolshevik Siberia - the anniversary of the entry of White-Czech troops into Omsk. The connection of the investigated issue with the historiography of the problem is given, on this basis the relevance of the work is connected with the introduction into the scientific turnover of unpublished sources from the funds of the Historical Archive of the Omsk region. These documents allow us to detail the emergence, discussion and coordination of the initiative, the course and results of the official celebrations in Kolchak's Omsk on June 7, 1919, positioned as the day of "liberation of Siberia" and "revival of Russian statehood". The importance of those events is connected with the fact that Omsk then had the official status of the capital of anti-Bolshevik Russia. The aim of the paper is to analyze the preparation and results of the celebration on the basis of new sources - minutes of the Omsk City Duma meeting within the period - the end of May and the beginning of June 1919. The theoretical basis of the research is a combination of approaches (institutional, systemic, anthropological) and methods (problem-chronological, comparativehistorical) traditional for historical science. This makes it possible to establish the degree of participation of the institutions of power in the attempt to establish a new public holiday of potential significance for the entire anti- Bolshevik Siberia, as well as the role of specific socio-political figures in the realization of that initiative. The nature and course of the celebration demonstrate the conservative views of the authorities in White Omsk (both at the level of the Russian government and the City Duma), as well as the special importance of the festivities of June 7, 1919 for the highest circles of the anti-Bolshevik statehood. In addition, the study of the celebrations in the Kolchak capital prompts thoughts about the significant influence of the religious factor in the Civil War in eastern Russia. The study is an example of when a casual episode of local history acquired all-Russian significance. The work also emphasizes the inviolable postulate of historical research that for a full-fledged assessment of events it is essential to take into account the widest possible range of sources. The publication may be of interest to academic specialists studying the Civil War and anti-Bolshevik movement in the East of Russia, the history of public holidays, as well as socio-political and everyday life in the era of social cataclysms.

AB The article presents an original classification of patterns of transformation of party systems in EU countries under the influence of the institutionalization of a new post-industrial cleavage. Drawing on theories of cleavage and spatial competition and using party positioning databases, elec-toral indices and statistics, the author attempts to identify the main trajectories of the transformation of the European party systems between 1990 and 2023 and identify factors that explain the differences between them. The study identified five patterns associated with the effects of two key parameters. The first one is the structural specificity of the conditions of party competition in post-communist and other EU countries, associated with the difference between the old structured and new volatile party systems. The se-cond parameter is the type of a country's party-political system in accordance with Arend Lijphart's classification - either majoritarian-polarized or coali-tion-consensus. While under majoritarian system the institutionalization of a new cleavage often gave rise to a radical breakdown of the old configuration of parties with the emergence of powerful populist forces, under consensus sys-tem - a smooth increase in fragmentation with the outflow of votes in favor of various new parties and the complication of the process of forming coalitions. For a number of countries other factors, such as the level of socio-economic development, ethnocentricity of politics, the type of electoral system and the stability of the welfare state appeared relatively important. In contrast, hypoth-eses about the significance of the initial configuration of party systems, the timing of formation of new parties and the geographical proximity of countries were not confirmed.

DE education system; mass consciousness; illusory reality
AB Mythology, acting as one of the forms of reality constructor, is an integral part of culture. The emergence of virtualization and the rapid development of the communication space served as a lever for the rapid development of social myth-making, which is actively being introduced into all spheres of society, including the education system. Thanks to the virtualization of the educational environment, on the one hand, the pace of construction, development and dissemination of social myth increases, the architecture of living space is built, behavior, relationships and norms of the existing order are sanctioned, and the influence of social myth on the ways of personality formation is updated. On the other hand, by increasing the speed of spread of social myth in the virtual environment, as well as its communication accessibility, active spontaneous myth-making is carried out, influencing the formation of mass consciousness. The virtual environment is a form of communication where broad interpersonal interaction is realized through digital technologies. For social mythology, it acts as an ideal one and contributes to the construction and dissemination of social myths present in learning processes. This environment influences human consciousness and participates in the formation of personality. With the advent of new technologies, only the form of the social myth changes. The content of social myth and social mythology does not undergo significant changes. Social myth-making in the virtual educational space develops spontaneously and in an avalanche-like manner. It needs mechanisms for social regulation and, above all, control over the quality and reliability of the content offered. Such control, carried out by all actors in the educational process, taking into account the principles of freedom of expression and pluralism of opinions of participants in communication in the virtual educational space, will allow the formation of the necessary educational competencies without limiting the discussion environment and academic freedom.

DE social institutions; university systems; human capital
AB As part of a change in the vector of globalization development, a revision of approaches to the formation of social potential, which is a systemic set of abilities and capabilities of individuals and social groups, is required, ensuring social reproduction. The formation and reproduction of social potential occurs in an ensemble of fields of social interactions, which include culture, education, science, economics, etc. Modern higher school at the national, state and global levels is included in the work of specific social institutions that formalize, normalize and organize all types and forms of activities existing in society in these key areas. Therefore, from the point of view of the total social potential of society, educational potential is, first of all, the educational level of the current population as a result of previous educational activities. Consequently, in the structure of the total social potential, educational potential can act as a resource support for any educational activity, i.e., the social institution of education and its core - the education system. Accordingly, based on the dynamics of changes in the priorities of higher school graduates, we can build a forecast of changes in the total social potential. Since universities, focused primarily on training personnel for the production of fundamental knowledge, act as the "flagships" of the education system, it is their development that is the most important prerequisite for socio-political, socio-economic and socio-cultural changes that influence the formation of the overall social potential. The results of annual sociological research conducted at Novosibirsk State University show the continued positive dynamics of the young specialists' involvement in the scientific and educational sphere. At the same time, engaging in scientific activity as a value for which one enters a master's program, is losing its position. If it turns out to be possible to create mechanisms for university graduates' professional growth, then the training of scientific personnel can act as a tool for improving the quality of the intellectual characteristics of the total social potential.

DE metaepistemology; ethics; moral standards; cynicism
AB This article presents a meta-epistemological analysis of Peter Sloterdijk's critique of cynicism that aims to identify the moral standards underpinning his assessment of contemporary cynicism and to evaluate their validity. The article examines how moral and ethical attitudes influence epistemological processes and the formation of theories, and analyzes the complex interplay between universal and culturally specific moral standards in Sloterdijk's theory. The primary focus is on the fact that Sloterdijk's critique is based on Enlightenment ideals such as rationality, critical thinking, and respect for human dignity. These ideals highlight the universal aspects of his moral standards. However, the interpretation of these ideals within the context of contemporary Western philosophy underscores culturally specific elements. Sloterdijk's personal philosophical views, his emphasis on intellectual effort and critical thinking add depth to his critique but can also introduce bias, underscoring the need for critical self-reflection and adherence to commonly accepted moral standards. The article addresses the question of the admissibility of incorporating personal assessments into scientific theories and their impact on epistemological analysis. The findings indicate that Sloterdijk's personal and cultural orientations play a significant role in his theory, but his critique of cynicism remains justified as his moral standards largely align with universal ethical principles. This underscores the importance of applying universal moral standards to ensure the objectivity, fairness, and reliability of theories, as well as the necessity of critical self-reflection and openness to critique to maintain the status of a researcher. Thus, the article demonstrates that incorporating personal assessments into scientific theories is both possible and necessary, provided they are well-founded, transparent, and aligned with commonly accepted moral standards. This approach helps maintain the scientific value and objectivity of theories, contributing to the creation of deeper and more substantiated science.

AB The article deals with the social well-being of residents of three Far Eastern regions - the Republic of Buryatia, Zabaykalsky Krai, and Primorsky Krai. The analysis is based on the results of a sociological study conducted in October 2023 - March 2024. The study revealed a high level of optimism among respondents (54.3% in the Republic of Buryatia, 64.1% in Zabaykalsky Krai, 51.5% Primorsky Krai), corresponding to the results of all-Russian studies. The degree of satisfaction of respondents with various aspects of life is characterized. The respondents are more satisfied with family relationships, communication with friends, food, clothing, and living conditions. The respondents are the least satisfied with the political situation in the country, the environmental situation in the region, and the availability of money. The regional phenomena causing the greatest concern in all the three regions were identified: rising prices for food and essential goods, rising prices for housing and communal services, low income of the working population, medical care (quality, cost). A rating of alarming circumstances related to the personal safety of citizens was determined. Most often, the respondents are concerned about such fears as the future of children, getting sick with an incurable disease, loss of family, becoming unemployed, becoming a victim of thieves, robbers, scammers. It is concluded that there is a significant resource for strengthening Russian identity in three Far Eastern regions, based on the respondents' satisfaction with basic needs, positive assessments of life in their regions, positive social sentiments, and an optimistic vision of their future.

DE eighteenth century diplomacy; Holy Roman Empire; protocol and formulae

   sovereignty; epistolary etiquette
AB This article, based on unpublished materials from the Archive of Foreign Policy of the Russian Empire, represents the first historiographical analysis of the languages used in official correspondence-such as letters of credence, recall, and notifications-between the secular and ecclesiastical electors of the Holy Roman Empire and Russian emperors during the eighteenth century. Employing the methodological framework of diplomatics, an auxiliary historical discipline, the author utilizes formulaic analysis to examine the mandatory expressions and formulas in the opening and closing protocols of these letters. These linguistic conventions provide insights into the social status of both sender and recipient, reflecting the hierarchical nature of diplomatic relationships. The article contributes to the growing interest in early modern diplomatic languages, a field that has gained traction in recent foreign historiography, particularly in studies of negotiation practices at international congresses. Archival research reveals distinct patterns in the linguistic practices of the electors. Saxon electors corresponded with Russian emperors in German, while the electors of the Palatinate and Bavaria initially used Latin before transitioning to German in the mid-eighteenth century. Ecclesiastical electors-the archbishops of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne-also wrote in German. On rare occasions, French was used. Conversely, Russian monarchs adhered to tradition, drafting official correspondence in Russian with German translations attached. The article concludes that the choice of language serves as a formal indicator of the nature of relationships between rulers, highlighting the distinction between sovereign monarchs and electors, who, de jure, remained vassals. This hierarchical disparity is further reflected in the use of kinship terms within the correspondence. For example, Russian emperors addressed secular electors not as "brothers" or "sisters"-terms typically reserved for sovereign equals- but as "uncles," "aunts," or, later, "in-laws" (occasionally "cousins").These designations underscored the unequal status of the correspondents. Additionally, the correspondence sheds light on the process by which the influential Estates of the Holy Roman Empire recognized the imperial title of the Russian monarchs. By analyzing the linguistic and formal characteristics of these letters, the study provides new insights into the social and political dynamics of eighteenth-century diplomacy.

AB The political dimension of science is one of the major topics in STS. The "political" there has two distinguishable, although often complementary, faces: it can be considered as an object of study, as well as a source of conceptual metaphors. In the first case politics, understood literally as a domain of particular social relations concerning the public sphere and the distribution of power resources, is inevitably involved in the discussions of any issues related to the science's role and place in the society and the state. In the second case the sphere of politics is no longer a mere object of study but a field where new conceptual instruments for STS can be found or created. P. Feyerabend's works allow to distinguish and illustrate these two ways of engaging the political in STS. His concept of epistemological anarchism is the result of metaphorical transition of the notion of anarchy from political discourse into philosophical one, while his referring to the problems of democracy in science and society is an example of using politics as a research object along with the science itself. The paper traces both the differences and conceptual relationships between these two faces of politics in STS from Feyerabend to some of the present-day approaches such as actor- network theory. Examples of the development of the issues raised by Feyerabend and the specifics of addressing them in modern projects, as well as the political dimension of the STS themselves are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the projects of B. Latour, J. Law and A. Mol and the concept of ontological politics, which comprises various complex forms of hybridization of politics as both an object and a tool of research, as well as of descriptive and prescriptive research modes.

DE Great Patriotic War; Siege of Leningrad; state trade; private trade;

AB The article deals with the problem of the relationship between participants in state trade and private barter operations in besieged Leningrad. The critical shortage of food during the blockade led to a change in the nature of relations between ordinary citizens, on the one hand, and workers in trade, public catering, storage, transportation, and distribution of products, on the other. Extremely emaciated Leningraders were stunned by the prosperous appearance of the counter workers, who bought up and exchanged gold, jewelry, and furs for food. The prosperity of these people against the background of the death of hundreds of thousands determined the extremely hostile attitude of many citizens towards them. The blockade survivors treated extremely emaciated dystrophics with the same hostility. Moreover, the latter were ultimately treated worse than the dishonest "food workers". The glaring inequality was a sign of overestimation of people, rigidly dividing them into well-fed and hungry, successful and losers. This was contrary to the ethical, ideological and political attitudes of the townspeople. At the same time, many blockade survivors were happy, happy, acquiring crumbs of food at fantastically high prices or in exchange for valuables. The ambivalent attitude of Leningraders towards private commerce was associated with the role that commerce played in the fate of many, both robbing and saving at the same time. As sources, the article uses evidence of war and blockade times: diaries, letters, official documents of state authorities and administration, law enforcement, as well as verbal transcripts collected shortly after the blockade and war, interviews and memoirs of citizens of a later time.

AB The article considers the city through the prism of Niklas Luhmann's theory of systems. In the optics of Luhmann's autopoietic systems, the city does not look like an object, but as a communication system and as a cognitive, self-referential system. The city as a communication system exists in various modes: text, dialogue, metaphysical idea, sociocultural project. As a cognitive system, the city exists as images of perception and representation. It is argued that the objective and semantic chaos of the urban environment acts as a direct synergetic mechanism for the development of the city. The "city" system as a cognitive system is independent, self-sufficient and has its own logic of change. Urban space exists as a continuous inversion of internal characteristics into the external environment and back. It was not society that "gave birth" to the city, but the city that transforms society. The city is a mechanism for the transition of a traditional society into a modern and postmodern one. The city is a driver of new social systems.

AB The article is devoted to the trend towards revision the concept of a resource in the discourse of social sciences. The increased demand for natural resources and the significant expansion of extractive industries have drawn the attention of the scholars to various socio-economic and environmental consequences. It also raised complex issues of ontology and epistemology of resources. The critical and relational perspective developed in social resource research offers an understanding of resources not as "natural" and "finished", but as socially, culturally, politically and economically constructed. The new research optics significantly problematized the issues of space and time. The article has shown that an impressive variety of spatial and temporal frames arise in the context of resource extraction and use. Due to spatial concepts and practices, specific resource extraction sites, distributed spatial infrastructures, clash and tension of scales are appeared. Various ways of experiencing, comprehending, and mobilizing time are actively involved in the political and economic structure, in interactions with the materiality of resources and technologies, as well as in the processes of their assessment. It is demonstrated that the spatialities and temporalities of resource projects are formed, transformed and recreated around unstable and variable relationships. Resources are presented as inherently distributed objects, the essence of which should not be sought either exclusively in their biophysical properties or in networks of social and cultural meanings. The classification of something as a resource is primarily related to the social understanding of utility and value. The most important condition for structuring the links between society and resources is scientific knowledge and technology

AB This article analyses the history of the "Singapore case" of Moscow Narodny Bank (MNB), one of the most prominent Soviet financial cases of the second half of the 1970s. Using documents from the Russian State Archive of the Economy, the author describes the reasons for opening a bank in this south-eastern country, focusing on the phenomenon of the Soviet banking sector abroad in the late 1960s and 1970s. The article shows that while the USSR's decision to open banks in Western countries was based on economic interests (reducing foreign exchange costs, supporting lending to socialist countries), in the countries of the Global South political circumstances prevailed. Singapore played an important role in promoting Moscow's diplomatic interests. At the same time, the Soviet Union paid far less attention to economic relations with the island state, although a branch of Moscow Narodny Bank was opened there in 1971. Drawing on documents, the article shows how the Soviet bank became a leading bank in Singapore within a few years, providing a large volume of loans to private companies. At the same time, the article reveals that most loans were granted without observing basic financial rules and for risky real estate transactions. This, together with the global financial and commodity crisis, was a key factor in the creation of a debt of almost US $450 million. The reasons for this incident were both subjective (the incompetence of the Soviet management of the branch and the criminalisation of the actions of representatives of local banking structures) and objective - the lack of a coherent foreign policy of the USSR in Southeast Asia.

AB The preservation of the ethnocultural specificity of the people is impossible without attention to the traditions of its national cuisine. The latter can exist not only where it was born and existed for a long time, but also as a cultural heritage of peoples who moved to new territories and live in the socio-political conditions of another state. While exploring the culture of our country, it is interesting to turn to the small cultures of immigrants, since they demonstrate the distinctive features of the culture of their people and, at the same time, the connection with the Russian culture with which they interact. The subject of this article are the peculiarities of the national cuisine of the Russian Germans of Siberia living in the German National Region of the Altai Territory. The national cuisine of any nation is represented by a large variety of dishes, but often not all of them are iconic forAa particular culture. In this regard, in order to identify the specifics of the German national cuisine, meat and sausage products produced by Br & uuml;cke LLC in the region were chosen, since these dishes are the symbols of German culinary art. To understand the regional specifics of the manufactured products, a comparative analysis was also carried out with the range of products of one of the leaders of the German meat processing industry- the German concern Kaufland Fleischwaren. The data for the analysis were taken principally from TV interviews with representatives of enterprises and official websites of companies, where a range of meat and sausage products is presented. As a result of the study, the stability of the preservation of the national specificity of the food culture is noted both among residents of Germany and among German settlers of the Altai Territory. Thus, the desire to follow the national model of nutrition with a predominance of meat and sausage products determined the peculiarities of the choice of the profile of food industry enterprises among the Germans of the German National Region, the largest of which was the meat processing plant. At the same time, we note the presence of borrowed dishes both in the assortment of the German concern Kaufland Fleischwaren and Br & uuml;cke LLC. In our opinion, in the first case, these borrowings are due to the Americanization of the food culture, focused on fast food and characteristic of many modern national cuisines of the world, on the one hand, and on the other, due to the geographical proximity of European countries, where cultural exchange, including in eating habits is inevitable. The presence of borrowed dishes in the assortment of the Altai enterprise is primarily associated with the stable technological traditions of the Soviet food industry. At the same time, it is obvious that the enterprise strives to produce German meat and sausage products based on traditional recipes, as well as to develop new types of products of German origin, but with a recipe adapted to the realities of Russian food culture.

AB The study deals with the historical and cultural ties of Russians with indigenous peoples of the North. Basing on the actualization, structure and identification of elements of traditional values, the author highlights regional features appealing to musical and choreographic creativity. Due to adoption of the civilizational approach in explaining historical reality, this direction turns out to be the most promising. The ethnic history of a people is a complex and multifaceted process. Each nation, as a rule, lives surrounded by others, with whom it enters into a wide variety of contacts, including socio-economic, political, cultural, domestic and family and marriage. There is a process of ethnic mixing, changes in anthropological types and the complication of the anthropological composition of the ethnic group, with borrowings in the economy, spiritual culture and language and certain changes occuring in the social and family way of life, etc. All this, along with other reasons, contributes to the development of the economy and the leveling of spiritual culture, shaping mentality of the ethnic group. A higher level of Russian culture, in terms of stages development, turned out to be dominant in the system of ethno-cultural communications. The paper shows that under the influence of Russian culture, musical and choreographic creativity of the indigenous peoples of the region has enriched and proved itself significantly, and has become known to many countries and peoples of the world.

DE Mikhail Prishvin; Joseph Stalin; Bolshevism; class struggle;
   collectivization; state
AB This article examines the perspectives of M. M. Prishvin on the collectivization of agriculture, utilizing materials from his "Diary", which have only recently entered scholarly discourse in the post-Soviet years. The choice of this topic is motivated by the ongoing relevance and intensity of discussions surrounding the Stalin era in Soviet society. The focus of this study is a previously unexamined aspect within Prishvin studies: the writer's attitude toward the radical transformation of traditional Russian peasant life. It is demonstrated that Prishvin, on one hand, critiques the ruthless methods employed in implementing collectivization, while on the other hand, acknowledges the positive aspects of the economic reforms occurring in rural areas. The significance of Prishvin's insights regarding the origins and causes of collectivization is further underscored by the fact that his conclusions often predate those of several later researchers of the Soviet period. Prishvin's analysis of both subjective and objective factors influencing Stalin's collectivization reveals him not only as a gifted writer but also as an exceptional thinker with a distinct perspective on the pressing ideological, political, economic, and sociocultural issues of his time.

AB The research questions that the authors of the article focused on are the following: What are the resources and barriers to modernizing the higher education system in Tajikistan? What determines educational cooperation between Tajikistan and Russia? What are the prospects for expanding the export of Russian services in the field of higher education to Tajikistan in the current international political crisis that started in 2022-2023? The study is based on an analysis of works by foreign and Russian authors about the peculiarities of the development of higher education systems in the countries of Central Asia and Tajikistan in particular. Since the period 2022-2023 is little reflected in the research literature, the authors relied on available statistical data from national departments of Tajikistan and international organizations (UNESCO and the World Bank), as well as news reports about events in bilateral relations between Russia and Tajikistan. As a result of the study, the following conclusions were made. Barriers to the modernization of the higher education system in Tajikistan are both objective (demographic pressure, high levels of poverty and corruption, low government spending on education) and subjective ( declarative planning, choice in favor of an extensive path of development for the higher education system, risk avoidance by managers) factors. Resources for modernization are education in the Russian language, which allows borrowing Russian practices, international development assistance, and educational cooperation with Russia. The latter is developing despite the deteriorating international situation. In 2022-2023, new Russian schools were opened in Tajikistan and new agreements were signed. However, enrollment in Russian universities from Tajikistan fell. And although the authors suggest that this is rather a short-term phenomenon, it is recommended to continue efforts to spread the Russian language in Tajikistan and build mutually beneficial cooperation between Russian schools in Tajikistan and Russian universities.

AB The article is devoted to studying the representation of state as value in the speeches of the deputies of the State Duma from the viewpoint of the image of Russia's future. As a starting point, the authors used the pentabasis model, where the image of the future is presented in the form of five elements, one of which is the state, interpreted via trust in political institutions. The theoretical basis of the study was the concept of Stein Rokkan and his followers, according to which the state formation involves building socio-cultural boundaries that indicate belonging to a political community. The empirical basis was the transcripts of speeches of deputies on current socio-economic, political and other issues at the plenary sessions of the State Duma of VII-VIII convocations. The research was carried out by the method of discourse analysis. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that national parliamentarians are deeply concerned about the problem of trust. Although decisions on the most fundamental issues are made via consensus, deputies feel a lack of trust among certain groups of the population, which requires them to exert additional efforts to justify their initiatives. The topics they most often turn to include welfare state, center-regions relations, and economic development. At the same time, they rarely directly touch upon the prospects of domestic political institutions, as well as the topic of the image of the future in general, which may be explained by both a shortage of strategic ideas and external restrictions on parliamentary discourse.

AB The article investigates citizens' letters addressed to officials in the second half of the 20(th) century. The authors show that people perceived the government as a multicomponent structure. People addressed their letters to the leaders of the Soviet State, to the central government and local authorities, to various social institutions, as well as to journals and newspapers. Soviet citizens often addressed their letters both to the central newspapers such as Trud ( Labour ), Izvestiia (News), Krokodil ( Crocodile ) and to local ones. Soviet citizens wrote their letters hoping to solve their everyday problems as well as in response to propaganda and agitation. To understand the specifics of this epistolary discourse, one should investigate both the issues discussed in a letter and its format: politeness formulas, emotions, arguments, etc. The research shows that Soviet citizens treated authorities through the prism of social and political guidelines and patterns. The chronological analysis enables the researchers to explore the evolution of the interaction between citizens and authorities and the dynamics of citizens' confidence in the actions of the government. The research shows that in the second half of the 20th century citizens viewed the actions of the government with growing criticism. In their letters, citizens did not express requests, they criticized. The ideology experienced a crisis, the gap between common people and authorities was growing, letterwriters were more demanding, social trust was gradually declining to increase during the Era of Perestroika. The authors conclude that social transformations had a great impact on the interaction between society and authorities.

AB The historical-biographical sketch explores several episodes in the life and activities of a prominent Russian military leader, one of the founders of the intelligence service in the pre-revolutionary Russian army, Major General P. F. Ryabikov (1875-1932). Serving in the White Movement as the 2nd Chief of Staff Quartermaster of A. V. Kolchak's staff, General P. F. Ryabikov acquired competencies as a curator of military propaganda and organizer of periodical publications, which he later successfully utilized as a leader in these areas of military-political activity within the White emigration in Japan and China. From July 1920 to September 1921, P. F. Ryabikov served in the mission of the Commander-inChief of all armed forces of the Russian Far Eastern Territory, Ataman G. M. Semenov, in Yokohama, where he was involved in establishing a network of correspondent-informants for this mission in European countries and the United States, receiving reports and messages about the state of these countries, as well as informing representatives of foreign states in line with the ideology of the Semenovites and publishing anti-Bolshevik literature. In October 1921, at the request of Ataman G. M. Semenov, P. F. Ryabikov transferred his activities to Shanghai, where he continued his assigned work with agent-informants and cooperation in the Russian emigrant press. Having no material and organizational support from G. M. Semenov, Ryabikov severed ties with him in February 1922 and embarked on a path of independent political and journalistic activities.

AB The article discusses the use of development assistance as a foreign policy tool by the Benelux countries, namely Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The paper aims to answer the question whether the development assistance provided by the Benelux states corresponds to their political statements which cite this policy area as a soft power instrument, or the three approaches to development assistance rather reflect other goals, e.g. beneficial economic cooperation with developing countries. The article analyzes international statistical data, sociological surveys and official development assistance-related documents, using qualitative historical and descriptive as well as genealogical and historical methods to trace the evolution of the three countries' approaches. The concepts of small and middle powers, to which the Benelux countries belong, and the concept of soft power constitute the theoretical and methodological framework of the research. The article concludes that the Benelux countries' approaches to development assistance are different, complex and changeable. The pursuit of economic goals helps explain at least some of the three states' geographic and functional priorities, which translate into defining countries where Benelux' companies are situated as key partners or specializing in the development assistance areas where these companies can be involved. This pursuit is most clearly evident in the Dutch approach, while Luxembourg seems to value soft power function more as it enhances the country's image as one of the most generous donors and a responsible member of the international community. Unlike Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium show a downward trend in the amount of assistance allocated (with the exception of 2015 and 2022), amid doubts about the effectiveness of development assistance and securitization of this area; however, the ongoing public debates keep relevant the use of development assistance as soft power vis-& agrave;-vis the countries of the Global South.

DE decommunization; post-communist nationalism; Lithuania; Latvia; Estonia
AB The article analyzes the process of legislative registration of anti-communist national mythology in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. The subject of the study is the normative acts adopted within the framework of the policy of decommunization by the leadership of the Baltic states in the late 1980s - early 2020s. The relevance of the study is due to the active phase of decommunization observed in the Baltic republics since 2022, which, in turn, makes it necessary to analyze the formation and development of the anti-communist policy in these countries and to clarify its significance for the development of political national historical and political mythology and national identity of Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians. The introduction provides a brief description of the ethnocratic regimes that have developed in post-communist Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Special attention is paid to the concept of a "nationalizing state" proposed by American sociologist Rogers Brubaker to describe the post-communist regimes of Central and Eastern Europe. The first section examines the foundations of the "doctrine of occupation" and the principle of continuity, which were laid down in normative acts adopted by the supreme authorities of the Baltic states at the turn of the 1990s. The second section analyzes the further formation of the "doctrine of occupation" in the memorial laws of the Baltic states in the 1990s -2000s and the influence of the "doctrine of occupation" on the national legal systems of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The third section examines the transformation of the commemorative culture, the memorial and geocultural landscape of the Baltic states in the post-Soviet period under the influence of anti-communist legislation. In conclusion, the importance is assessed of the decommunization policy for state-building, as well as for the formation of national commemorative culture and historical and political mythology of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and the prospects are given for the further development of the anti-communist campaign in these states, based on the current international situation.

DE South Africa; women's representation; UN; human rights; gender equality;
   leadership style
AB In the current conditions of confrontation with the West, Russia seeks to diversify its external relations, hence a growing attention it pays to such partners as African countries. Establishing effective cooperation requires deep knowledge of political elites, which is largely facilitated by the research of Russian Africanists, conducted primarily at the Institute of African Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences as well as in other research centers- the Centre for African Studies of the Institute of World History of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Asian and African Countries of Moscow State University, MGIMO University, HSE University, IMEMO of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Oriental Faculty of St. Petersburg State University, etc. Among their areas of interest are such subjects as the study of female political elites, as well as the elites in multilateral institutions, primarily in the UN structures. Since the early 2000s, one of the main features of the formation of political leadership in the Republic of South Africa (South Africa) has been the expansion of women's representation in government bodies at all levels. Some of these women held leadership positions in various UN structures. This article uses functional and biographical research methods to analyze the activities of South African women who have been active in human rights issues, in the fight against hunger and HIV/AIDS at the national and international levels, at the UN and the African Union. This article's research was centered at such prominent South African political figures as Mrs. N. Pillay, Mrs. P. Mlambo-Ngcuka, and Mrs. S. Sisulu. The author notes both their achievements in solving the above-mentioned contemporary problems and the difficulties they encountered in their activities. Special attention is paid to the attitude of South African women towards the issue of gender equality, which they consider a necessary condition for democratic development. At various multilateral venues, Mrs. N. Pillay, Mrs. P. Mlambo-Ngcuka, and Mrs. S. Sisulu advocated for the empowerment of women in all areas of political, economic, and public life, both while holding leadership positions in the UN and after completing their terms of office. The long-standing work of South African women at the UN in the fight for human rights, against hunger and HIV/AIDS and for gender equality demonstrates the possibility of women's participation in solving contemporary problems at levels of utmost significance.

AB The key task of the research, the results of which are reflected in the article, is to reconstruct the history of the formation of the German discourse of scientific knowledge of the culture in the XIX - early XX centuries. The focus is on little-known and little-studied primary sources in Russia devoted to the development of holistic (kulturwissenschaft, kulturologie) and differentiated (kulturwissenschaften) knowledge about culture. It is established that the initial area of use of the term " kulturwissenschaft" was economics (late XVIII - early XIX centuries). The first attempt to deduce the term "kulturwissenschaft" beyond the limits of scientific understanding of the problems and issues of agriculture and, in fact, the first project to create a holistic science of culture belongs to Moritz von Laverne-Pegillen (1838). After Laverne-Pegillen, the kulturwissenschaft problem did not leave German socio-economic and socio-political thought until the last quarters of the XIX century. Then it gradually lost its relevance - the publications were isolated and unsystematic in nature. In parallel, the development of the scientific potential of kulturwissenschaft and kulturwissenschaften by leading historians, philologists, philosophers of that time is being considered. Special attention is paid to the figure of Friedrich Gustav Klemm. It is noted that Klemm's version of kulturwissenschaft, as well as his analysis of the carriers of the material foundations of human culture, found their continuation in the scientific work of Edward Burnett Tylor, and through him Leslie Alvin White. In the context of sociological discussions, in which the tendency to identify kulturwissenschaft and sociologie prevailed, the concept of Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald is considered, who introduces the term "kulturologie" as an alternative to the term "kulturwissenschaft" for convenience, formal consistency and verbal harmony between the names of the life sciences - physiologie, psychologie und kulturologie. In conclusion, it is concluded that the German discourse of scientific knowledge of culture, which resulted in the formation of two research programs - kulturwissenschaft (kulturologie) and kulturwissenschaften - made a significant contribution to the development of the problem of differentiation of sciences, contributed to the strengthening of research attention to the phenomenon of culture, had a significant impact on the formation of English and American anthropology. It is argued that the experience of German thinkers can and should be updated, and the concepts of Moritz von Laverne-Pegillen and Friedrich Gustav Klemm should take an honorable place in the history of the formation of culturology on legitimate grounds.

AB The journal "Voprosy Filosofii" has repeatedly addressed various aspects of the philosophy of culture. In particular, issues of the interaction between Russia, the West, and the East, the unity of the world and the diversity of cultures, multiculturalism and the dialogue of cultures, the role of the philosopher in culture, and the prospects for the development of Russian culture have been discussed. Special im-portance has been given to the understanding of cultural studies as a scientific and educational discipline. In April 2024, we once again turned to the philosophy of culture in the context of the problem of "Europeanism" and discussed the historical meaning sand contemporary transformations of this cultural-historical phenomenon. The following questions were proposed for discussion. What constitutes the "essence" of Euro-pean culture? Does "Europeanism" have an obligatory historical and geographical at-tachment? Why does the methodological concept of "presentism-antiquarianism" gaincrucial importance today, particularly for research in the field of the philosophy of cul-ture? Is antiquity the origin only of European culture, or is it the origin of the GreatCulture? Is "Europeanization of the Earth" possible today? (Spengler, Husserl, Hei-degger). Who are the true heirs of antiquity today? Are there differences betweenGreek and Roman cultures? Which type has Europe inherited today, and to what ex-tent? Has the perception of "Europeanism" changed in Russian and world philosophyof the 19th-21st centuries? The role of Hegel in the mythologization of "Europe."Is"Europeanism" a political myth of the 21st century? How do you evaluate the at-tempts at philosophical comparisons of the crisis of European culture in the 1920s andthe 2020s? Does "Europeanism" exhaust European culture? And what philosophicalor cultural problem do we want to see behind this? The crucial topic of discussionwas the interpretation of Europeanism as a symbolic construct, connected withtheassessment of the prospects for the development of the cultural future of Russia,Europe, and Humanity.

AB The events of February 2022 became the starting point of a new wave of Russian emigration. On the one hand, this phenomenon can be considered within a series of previous migration waves, on the other hand, the modern context leaves its imprint on the current migration process, making it very special from the economic and sociocultural perspectives. The article presents an attempt to analyze this specificity with an emphasis on the characteristics of the economic behavior of emigrants. Empirically, the study is based on a series of in-depth interviews with people who left Russia after February 2022. On the basis of these interviews, the authors built idealized cognitive models of possible options for the economic behavior of migrants. The authors considered a total of four models: relocation, which involves searching for a job in the host country; relocation, which involves remote work for a Russian company; relocation, which involves creating or moving one's own business; relocation to a branch of a Russian company. Since the economic strategies of migrants are influenced by signals broadcast by the Russian government structures, the article analyzed the statements of representatives of these structures using the method of network cognitive mapping, which made it possible to reveal two types of official discourse in relation to those who left Russia, which differed in the extent of their criticism towards them. In general, the study showed that migrants of the latest wave are internally heterogeneous and fall into several groups that differ markedly in their motivation and patterns of economic behavior. At the same time, a significant part of them continues to cooperate with Russia in one way or another and, in principle, is ready to return to Russia. For them, migration is driven largely by security and/or economic reasons. Only a minority of emigrants left the coun-try due to their disagreement with the current political course and consider the possibility of coming back only if the political course changes radically.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of significance of the last book by E.V. Ilyenkov Leninist dialectics and metaphysics of positivism. Despite the frequent judgments that this book is not a successful work of the philosopher, it is proved that, on the contrary, it is very important, because, in fact, it is his dying final ideological testament. Since this book by Ilyenkov is devoted to the analysis of Materialism and Empirio-criticism by V.I. Lenin, the article argues for the non -triviality of this Lenin's book, and this also contradicts the frequent opinions that it tells only about the "basic truths of materialism". The article also analyzes the philosophy of A.A. Bogdanov as the main deathbed opponent of Ilyenkov in absentia and shows the originality of his version of philosophy in the context of the Marxist philosophical tradition. The final conclusion of the article is that, under the guise and in the person of Bogdanov and Russian machism, Ilyenkov criticized the stagnation current in Soviet society and the Soviet state under Brezhnev, the theoretical and socio-political stagnation, incompatible in his opinion with the desired further movement towards communism according to Marx and Lenin, because the three "whales" or logical foundations of Machism highlighted by Ilyenkov in the book - the principles of balance, economy of forces and organization - are at the same time a description of those principles that became decisive in the USSR in the 1970s, in the lives of ordinary Soviet people, and in leading party politics, in Soviet reality as a whole.

AB The article deals with the problem of the political mood of the population in the occupied Soviet territory and its reaction to German propaganda (on the example of the General District of Belarus). The purpose of the study: to identify specific features of the political mood of the population in the territory of the General District of Belarus in 1941-1944, to determine the factors that caused them, and the effectiveness of German propaganda. The sources for writing the work were the documents of the National Archive of the Republic of Belarus (NARB), the Russian State Military Archive (RGVA), the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History (RGASPI). The methods of research used are analysis, synthesis, and comparison. The problem of the political mood of the population and its reaction to German propaganda in the occupied Soviet territory remains a little studied problem until recently. At the same time, the general mood of the people, their expectations, and the reaction to the policy pursued by the occupation authorities had a significant impact on the outcome of the war. It should be noted that during the Great Patriotic War in the occupied territory of the BSSR there was the most massive partisan movement, the very presence of which was the clearest evidence of the attitude of Belarusians to the German authorities and their policies. At the same time, the political mood of the population of the General District of Belarus was not uniform. A small part, mainly the Belarusian intelligentsia, initially accepted the propaganda slogans about the << revival of Belarus >> with confidence, cooperated with the civil German administration in the field of propaganda, culture, education, participated in the creation of various collabor ationist organizations, naively expecting a << gift >> from the Nazis in the form of sovereignty. The overwhelming part of the society was extremely skeptical of the agitation and propaganda of the German authorities, while at the beginning of the war its position can be described as expectant and indifferent. The authors came to the conclusion that the political mood of the population of the General District of Belarus was determined by a number of objective factors: the lack of practice of independent state-building and long stay under the authority of other states, large-scale and destructive military actions between the Western countries and Russia that took place on the land of Belarus. In general, the reaction of the population of the district to the German propaganda was characterized by a high degree of distrust and skepticism, since the content of the propaganda materials was in sharp contrast to the harsh reality. The policy of << scorched earth >>, methods of fighting partisans, the genocide of Jews, the practice of forced recruitment of potential ostarbeiters - Aall this together leveled the slogans of German propaganda about the prospects of national and cultural construction of Belarus as part of the so- called << New Europe >>. .

AB The article discusses the main directions of German propaganda among young people in the occupied Soviet territory during the great Patriotic war (based on the materials of the General district of Belarus). The purpose of research is to determine the directions of the German administration's ideological influence on Belarusian youth, its forms and methods, dynamics, and effectiveness. The sources for writing the work were documents of the National archive of the Republic of Belarus ( NARB), analytical materials of Soviet authorities, reports of partisans, as well as a number of scientific studies on the topic of the work. Research methods - analysis and synthesis. The German occupation authorities in the territory of the General district of Belarus actively used propaganda tools to ensure their economic and political plans. Belarusian youth became a special object of ideological influence. Ablebodied young workers from the East had to make up for the shortage of workers in the war economy of the "3rd Reich". Belarusian youth tried to instill the values of national socialism. In addition to propaganda recruitment actions in Germany, the school and higher education system under the patronage of the German occupation authorities in the district, as well as a number of collaborator organizations, in particular, the Union of Belarusian Youth (SBM), had an ideological impact on children and youth. They tried to erase Soviet Communist values from the minds of young people. The young generation of occupied Soviet Belarus had to link their future with Nazi Germany. Young people tried to instill the idea that the previous years of Soviet power brought their homeland decline and suffering, and the revival of the Belarusian land is possible as part of the so-called "New Europe". This was proved by the creation of puppet pseudo-state institutions, including the "Belarusian Central Rada" ("BCR"). Both heads of the German district administration - V. Kube and K. von Gottberg - attached great importance to educating the young generation of the General district of Belarus in a nationalist and Pro-Nazi spirit. Young people were to become the mainstay of the German occupation authorities and a source of free labor. However, the rate of invaders to the Belarusian youth has failed. Participation in the "SBM" was mostly compulsory. Thus, the massive propaganda aimed at potential Belarusian Ostarbeiters from among the youth proved to be ineffective. Attempts to mobilize young people to actively resist the advancing Red Army units were also unsuccessful. The efforts of German and local propagandists were leveled by the extremely brutal occupation regime, including methods of fighting partisans, punitive SS expeditions against civilians, and mass extermination of Jews.

DE Kant's logic; Kant's philosophy of mathematics; intensional approach in
   logic; analytical; synthetic; construction of concepts
AB For Kant's theoretical philosophy, logic was not at all a separate or peripheral discipline. Quite the opposite, it can be argued that formal general logic became a kind of a paradigm of his transcendental philosophy, and its central ideas are due to the specific nature of Kant's logical concept. Kant's philosophy of mathematics is of particular interest, since one of the central questions of his Critique of Pure Reason is the question of how mathematics is possible as a science of universal and necessary truths. Kant's theoretical philosophy cannot be understood without his mathematical concept, since the type of synthesis that, according to Kant, underlies mathematics is the same as for all other objects of perception. In addition, in his transcendental philosophy, the difference between the philosophical and mathematical methods turns out to be fundamental. Undoubtedly, Kant's original logical concept, including the construction of a new and non-standard transcendental logic, could not but have a significant impact on the main characteristics of his philosophy of mathematics. Their mutual influence may be of interest to anyone who wants to find the key to understanding Kant's philosophy in a more general context. The following central provisions of Kant's philosophy of mathematics, formulated by him in "The Transcendental Aesthetic", "The Transcendental Doctrine of Method" and other small fragments of the Critique of Pure Reason, can be distinguished: firstly, it is the idea of formality of both mathematical and any rational cognition (just as formal logic is the basis of "empty" logical forms, mathematics is formal, since it deals with pure a priori forms of intuitions); secondly, it is the doctrine of the synthetic a priori character of mathematical truths; thirdly, it is his idea that mathematical knowledge is realized through the construction of concepts, and, finally, it is the idea of the direct and necessary connection of mathematical knowledge with pure forms of intuitions, i.e. with extremely general areas of empirical experience. At the same time, the apparatus of traditional logic available to Kant had significant limitations that did not make it possible to adequately represent mathematical knowledge. On the one hand, the features of Kant's interpretation of formal logic and the transcendental logic developed by him in his critical philosophy determine the constructive and synthetic nature of mathematical knowledge; on the other hand, the non-trivial philosophy of mathematics developed by him is a response to the limitations of traditional logic and an attempt to overcome them. The construction of mathematical concepts in pure a priori intuition allows one to go beyond the limits of these limitations in mathematical knowledge, which had exceptional consequences for the history of modern philosophy of mathematics and the history of the foundations of mathematics. It must be assumed that the key features of Kant's logical concept and his philosophy of mathematics have not yet exhausted their heuristic possibilities for topical research in these areas of science and philosophy.

ID DISCOURSE
AB This study addresses the issue of the linguistic explication of the concept of HEALTH within contemporary domestic media discourse. An investigation has been conducted into the functioning of the conceptual name - the lexeme 'health' - through linguistic ma-terial derived from contexts extracted from newspaper corpora within the National Cor-pus of the Russian Language. A corpus-based discursive analysis methodology was em-ployed. Conceptual-metaphorical models that enrich the meaning of the concept and expand its semantic scope have been identified. It is demonstrated that the semantic transforma-tions of the lexeme 'health' in its discursive realization reveal reflections on the under-standing of the abstract concept of HEALTH as a resource, substance, physical object, mechanism, container, living entity, and more. It has been established that the augmentation of the semantic volume of the concept in con-texts of attributive and genitive compatibility illustrates the dissemination of notions regard-ing health as a normal state or functioning of various entities across a wide array of spir-itual, moral, psychological, emotional, social, political, economic, financial, industrial, natu-ral, and cultural domains, including the op-erational sphere of devices, household items, instruments, and mechanisms. The study con-cludes with the assertion that the analyzed concept possesses a representative value potential linked to the cognitive dominance of normativity

DE media; imprinting in media; media communi- cations; media system
AB The author of this article posits that media communications serve as a context for the formation of imprinting - a psychophysiological mechanism whereby impressions or images are etched into the brain, evolving into stable behavioral programs. The identification of these programs is facilitated through the analysis of media texts with a high attention coefficient. The study analyzed 200 media texts across various typological niches within the contemporary media system: online news outlets, social media platforms (VK, Odnoklassniki), and blogs, including the "Zen" platform. The findings indicate that different typological segments of the media system represent distinct behavioral programs. In online news outlets, behavioral programs are explicitly manifested in cognitive actions aimed at understanding processes related to Russia's economic and political landscape. In social media, the prevailing behavioral program is encapsulated in a sentiment inspired by the phenomenology of serendipity. The "Zen" blog platform reveals imprinting through the categories of "irresponsibility," "playfulness," and "hooliganism." In other blogs featuring high attention indices, imprinting is observed in the contemplation of professional issues related to activities in the digital space. The various typological niches of the media system are geared towards the formation of heterogeneous psychophysiological mechanisms, which transform into an axiological foundation that shapes diverse behavioral programs.

AB The paper deals with the reception of "Austrian Freedom" emergence in the Middle Ages as an element of historical memory in the Habsburg empire in early XIX century. The Romanticist historiography tapped into revisiting the ideological grounds of Habsburg Empire, which took place after collapse of the Holy Roman Empire. Creating the Austrian empire in 1804 has become an impulse for producing the new historical memory to justify its legitimacy. It was Joseph von Hormayr to initiate the process during the Napoleonic warfare as a conservative ideologist and romanticist historian. The purpose of the paper is to analyze the elements of the "Austrian Freedom" myth presented in essays on Babenberg dynasty in "Austrian Plutarch" by Joseph von Hormayr. The twenty-volume work aimed to present the main historical figures of the Habsburg empire, both Austro-German and non- Germanic. Besides the Habsburgs, "Plutarch" also contained essays devoted to Czech and Hungarian regents, ministers, warlords, artists and scientists from all parts of the Empire. The essays published in volumes 19 and 20 o f the "Plutarch" dealing with the Babenberg era in Austria were the last part of the work. The main methodology is the history of concepts, which is aimed to analyze the emergence and evolution of a certain term and its revisiting within a surrounding con text. It should trace the elements of the "Austrian Freedom" as a pattern of Austrian historical memory and identity. Moreover, the concepts of imaginary community, historical myth and historical memory should ensure the study of "Austrian freedom" and its justification by Hormayr. The latest essays of the "Austrian Plutarch" were aimed at justifying the "Austrian Freedom" by means of historical memory. Narratives on the Babenberg era in Austria were to show succession to the Habsburg house as a proof forAa single historical mission of Ostmark - Austria. The image of Austria was given as a state with "independence, rapid economic development and loyalty to the Christian cause" and as an adequate example of centralization for the rest of Germany. Hormayr made a special emphasis on the ability of Austria to respond towards such challenges as hostile invasions and political instability of the Holy Roman Empire. The image of the "loyal vassal of the Emperor" turned into justification of the Austrian autonomy, whi ch was to enforce the Empire, and the Babenbergs became a personal image for it in the "Austrian Plutarch". .

   social-cultural core; levels of social identity
AB The relevance of the research is determined by the need to find ways for the consolidation and unification of the polycentric, multinational and multicultural Russian society under contemporary challenges. The author uses a complex theoretical-methodological approach combining the theory of social identity (H. Tajfel and J.C. Turner), the concepts of "self" (G. Mead) and "personality crisis" (E. Erikson), the phenomenological paradigm (A. Schutz) and the theory of cultural trauma (J. Alexander). The article presents a four- level structure of social identity, which includes individual, group, state and global (world) levels, and different types of social identity at each. Thus, the features of subjective and objective identities are shown at the individual level; regional, cultural, national, linguistic, professional and social-class identities - at the group level; state-civil, historical, territorial and political - at the state level; post-Soviet, Asian, European and cosmopolitan - at the global level. The author provides some empirical tools for identifying the affiliative component of social identity at the individual, group, state and global (world) levels and insists on the need to search for answers to research questions about the Russian identity in general, social- cultural differences between residents of Russia and other countries, territorial features of Russia as a state and its continent, the influence of the West and East on the Russian culture, and the impact of global openness and "liquid modernity" (Z. Bauman) on the Russian social identity. The article considers "triggers" for the transformation of social identity, which initially appear either at the individual or global level, depending on the context and social source. The author argues that the study of the social-cultural core of the heterogeneous Russian identity under the extremely dynamic and nonlinear social processes affecting the key areas of Russian life can contribute to the development of a strategy for improving social well-being in the Russian society and to the search for effective ways of its consolidation given its polycentricity and multiculturalism.

DE human capital; economics; philosophy; social philosophy; history;

AB The author of this paper is a specialist in history of philosophy and religions, poetics and political studies. The notion of human capital coined by American economical thought in the beginning of 1960th could hardly be a monopoly of economical discourse. Ex definitio , this notion has to contain in itself a lot of historical, cultural as well as philosophical connotations. According to the widening scope of our theoretical imagination, this notion seems to be more and more vital and complex as well as less dependent on the "Occam's razor". Actually, the value of this notion seems to be rather unique. Being almost elusive from strict quantifications, it could be intimately connected with the whole complex of present-day human realities. According to Professor Rashkovsky, analytical approach to this notion helps better comprehending some dramatic aspects of Russian history caused by underestimation (or perverted treating) of human meanings in history itself as well as human meanings in labor, societal connections, culture, etc. By the way, the author suggests reopening and partial present-day re -interpretation of economic ideas of Russian economist, philosopher and theologian Sergei N. Bulgakov: ideas though partly obsolete, but nevertheless vital for contemporary thought.

DT Article
DE neo-institutional approach; global indices; political institutions;
   economic institutions; economic growth; GDP; economic policy
AB This article investigates the relationship between the quality of political and economic institutions and economic growth. The study aims to empirically test the hypothesis of an interdependence between institutional quality and GDP growth rates following the global economic crisis of 2008 2009. The analysis focuses on the period of stable global economic growth from 2010 to 2018, with the upper boundary set at the onset of the COVID 19 crisis. To assess the quality of political institutions, each country's average "Democracy Index" ranking over the nineyear period is used. Economic institutional quality is measured via the country's average position in the ''Ease of Doing Business Index" over the same timeframe. Economic growth rates are determined by calculating the average ranking of countries over nine years according to World Bank data. Correlation analysis reveals that, in the post-crisis period, countries with lower positions in both indexes experienced the highest growth rates, while those leading in these rankings displayed comparatively lower economic growth. These observed differences may be attributable to the low-base effect in some rapidly growing countries and the effective economic policies of their elites. In contrast, the case of Russia highlights a unique pattern, where a low << Democracy Index >> position correlates with a low economic growth rate, and a relatively favorable << Ease of Doing Business Index >> position corresponds to lower growth - a paradox that may be explained by the severe negative impacts of the global economic crisis, anti-Russian sanctions, and ineffective economic policy. The findings underscore the need to further develop research methodologies at the intersection of political science and economics to deepen our understanding of the relationship between institutional quality across different sectors and macroeconomic performance dynamics.

DE reasoning automation; natural intelligence; artificial intelligence;
   categorical methodology; new intelligent technologies
AB One of the most important challenges that humanity will have to answer in the 21st century is its ability to master intelligence. This provides for the elaboration of a series of questions, including the following: Are there other, non-humanoid intellectual beings? In which variants, in relation to possible extra-human forms of intelligence, is human intelligence positioned (surpasses, lags behind, competes)? Using the topic of new technologies of natural intelligence in the automation of reasoning, the authors propose to shift the emphasis from the focus on the development of artificial intelligence as a competitor and even a threat to man in its strong version, to the task of a complex development of intelligence as a cosmic phenomenon. This focus provides for such a work plan, where the audit of natural intelligence should be the beginning. An assumption is made that the untapped potential of natural intelligence is very large, and its insufficient development was due to significant advances in computer automation. The authors propose to consider the prospects that open up from the use of categorical methodology in reasoning, and especially in their automation. Categories are defined by cognitive units that organize reasoning, and concepts are forms of thought that convey the meaning and content of reasoning. The experiments of implementing categorical methodology in dual and triadic constructions are discussed. It is stated that the potential of categorical schemes in the forms of triads is not sufficiently realized. The authors proceed from the assumption of a significant methodological potential contained in the theory of dynamic information systems (TDIS, DIS). TDIS can play the role of a base for the deployment of a categorical methodology. An example is given demonstrating the operation of a TDIS device. In conclusion, a summary is made about the expediency of the complex human development of intelligence, implemented in various ways and on a variety of natural and artificial media. A more important task, in comparison with the isolated improvement of artificial intelligence to the level of its strong version, is the work on the integration of individual intelligences. In principle, we can talk about a tremendous success in combining the computing power of computers in cloud technologies, but this is not the integration of intelligence.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Jean-Jacques Rousseau; Louis Althusser; materialism; political theology;
   contingency; multiple temporality
AB The article is devoted to the materialistic interpretation of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's political theology by Louis Althusser. This approach is particularly interesting because it treats materialism in a completely different plane from that of Marxism. Emphasizing the contingency of the emergence of the civil state, Althusser places Rousseau within the general tradition of modern materialism, the distinctive features of which are anti-theocentrism and anti-historicism. At the same time, Althusser emphasizes that Rousseau had a radically different view on the origins of human society from the ideas of other Enlightenment philosophers. This allowed Althusser to separate Rousseauism from the traditional political philosophy of the 18th century. For this reason, the parallel interpretation of Rousseau's views in the sphere of political theology does not in any way contradict the materialist interpretation of his teachings. In this article, the author scrutinizes the history of different approaches to the understanding of matter and materiality, and compares alternative perspectives on Rousseau's political theory. The article shows, that Althusser's interpretation was openly deconstructivist, even though it was based on the subjects brought up by Rousseau himself. In the final part, the author also touches upon the concept of multiple temporality, which, being closely connected with materialism, has a pure Rousseau's origin.

DE causality; independency; probability; frequency interpretation;
   subjective interpretation
AB In the article I demonstrate the value of philosophical research in science by the example of verification of conditions of using mathematics. In recent years, scientists in expert systems often use philosophical concepts, in particular the notion "causal relation" for introducing probabilistic independency, as the mathematical description of independency is not so constructive; therefore, verification of independency in data is a hard problem. Thus, by using philosophical notions in science, analytic philosophers have good chances to participate in multidisciplinary research, as non-philosophers do not commonly have wide and deep knowledge of philosophy. I draw on the example of the famous mathematician Shafer, who used a special version of causal relation to describe independency in his conception of a general probabilistic interpretation. The famous philosopher Cartwright raised a natural question about the adequacy of this interpretation for analyzing other causal relations. I offer another example of usefulness of philosophical analysis for verifying the conditions of application of mathematics which is connected with statistical wars. Statistical wars are battles between representatives of different probability interpretations; in particular, history knows severe battles between representatives of frequency and subjective interpretations. The followers of frequency interpretation are empiricists, the empirical tradition requires a careful verification of conditions of application of the formal apparatus, but such tests are not necessary in the subjective tradition, this is why their critique of opponents is not solid. I used such argumentation in my article in order to show that the critique of Kolmogorov's conditions of using probability theory on the basis of Bernoulli theorem by subjectivists is not a serious one. Besides, for an analytic philosopher who knows mathematical methods and can use them, new prospects are opening up due to imperfections of mathematical methods. The point is that scientists try to avoid criticizing shortcomings in the methods in the absence of alternative approaches, so a philosopher receives the chance to participate in research as a critic of imperfections of formal methods in applications.

AB Introduction. The article focuses on the changes that happened in the portrayal of U.S. characters in Soviet Thaw cinema. The contribution of the article in the field of cultural Cold War is threefold: for the first time, it studies the American characters' images through the prism of the concept of rehumanization; establishes common and particular traits of deconstruction of the image of the enemy in Soviet and American cinema; and introduces new materials into scientific circulation. The materials consist of the movies on which Soviet cinematography worked in the early 1960s; reviews in film magazines; and archival data of discussions on movies and their scenarios that took place in film studios. Analysis. Specifics of the dehumanization of 'enemy number one' in Soviet cinema. The Soviet anti -Americanism was based on the idea of 'two Americas': dehumanization has been subjected only to class and politically alien Americans. Deconstructing the image of the enemy in Thaw cinema. Humanizing U.S. characters was achieved with the help of endowing them with kindness, empathy, creativity, emotionality, moral behavior, ability for love, friendship, and comradeship, emphasizing the similarity of the basic values of 'us' and 'them', and demonstrating the possibility of peaceful coexistence through cases of mutual aid, cooperation, and the occurrence of friendly and romantic relations. The humanness of U.S. characters becomes less dependent on political factors. The cinema expressed the idea that man by nature was good, and this original human goodness was noticeable most of all in children, including American ones. The limits of rehumanization. The conservative part of the Soviet elite accused 'abstract humanism' of forgetting the class principle and juxtaposed it to 'revolutionary humanism'. Criticism of 'abstract humanism' in ideology was accompanied by a tightening of demands for representing America that representatives of the Soviet controlling bodies made. Results. In the 1960s, Soviet cinema (just like U.S. cinema) had the tendency of deconstructing the image of 'enemy number one', which took the form of rehumanization. The rehumanization had its limitations.

DE Dalai Lama; Mongolia; Buddhism; political process; post-secularity
AB This study explores the role of the Dalai Lama institution in the political processes of Mongolia, both from a historical perspective and in the context of contemporary events. The aim of the article is to identify the key factors influencing the presence of the Dalai Lama in Mongolia's socio-political life. Conceptually and methodologically, the research relies on the theory of post-secular society. The sources for this study include legal documents from Mongolia, data from national censuses, results from sociological surveys, and publications from Mongolian, Russian, and Western media that address the relationships between state, society, and religion. The authors argue that modern Mongolia exemplifies a post-secular society. It is noted that the abandonment of state atheism and the phenomenon of "Buddhist revival" have led to a significant intertwining of religious and secular institutions. The figure of the 14th Dalai Lama is regarded as a crucial participant in these processes. The study establishes that the main factors contributing to the involvement of the Dalai Lama in Mongolia's socio-political processes include his high religious authority among believers, the legitimization of Mongolian reincarnations, and his image as a "democratic leader." Factors that restrain the influence of the Dalai Lama include a significant segment of non-religious citizens in Mongolia, risks of deteriorating relations with the People's Republic of China, and trends toward the nationalization of Mongolia's Buddhist sangha.

AB The article compares the reckless socio-political dynamics in Russia in the 1990s, manifested in a series of crises and turning events, with the concept of mechanisms of the Russian historical cycles. The paper lists the main stages of dynamics - complexes of interrelated events that change he balance of power, structural conditions and the direction of subsequent processes. The author also lists the main actors and social groups involved in the political dynamics of that time period: supreme power, reformers, insiders, oligarchs, representatives of special services, "pro-soviet" and democratic opposition, urban educated class, workers and miners' movements,"ordinary people". The author concludes that the rapid sweeping changes in the politics of the 1990s took place, as they did before, in the parametric space with the axes of "state success" and "freedom". Transitions occurred between the phases that were typical for much longer cycles of the Russian historical past - "crisis", "liberalization", "authoritarian rollback", "state collapse", "military-political triumph". At the same time, the mechanism of the general democratic backsliding trend and the growth of authoritarian tendencies calls for clarification. The authors propose a phase model that explains this change through the patterns of response strategies of the supreme power to challenges and threats under different conditions. Weakness and failures of the state policy coupled with a shortage of resources led to mass disillusionment, delegitimization of the supreme power and reform policy, which manifested itself in elections and inspired the adherents of the restoration. The increase in the corresponding threats placed a premium on administrative and violent measures. Once sufficient resources were accumulated, those measures were becoming successful and received positive reinforcement. With each crisis, the supreme power took an upper hand, while the collegial separation of powers was reduced, and the reforms lost their original focus on economic freedom, the rise of small and medium-sized businesses, and the growth of democracy. As a result, the opportunities for the political modernization were missed, giving way to the authoritarian trends.

DE loyalty; local elites; Russian Empire; USSR
AB The article deals with the factors and institutional mechanisms that influence the level of loyalty of various national and local elites towards the central government in Russia. From the time of the Tsardom of Moscow, the Russian state has existed as a multi-religious and multi-ethnic society, where the internal policies were largely determined by interactions between the central government and regional/national elites. Loyalty plays a crucial role in maintaining a harmonious relationship between political actors in societies or states with indirect governance. The initial assumption is that the more an actor (e.g., the local elite) perceives a certain authority (e.g., the imperial center) as providing them security, social status, income and influence (authority, political participation), the higher the actor's loyalty to this authority will be. The cases of high loyalty ( the Ostsee knighthood, the Siberian and later Don Cossacks, the "quasi-state power" of the Stroganovs, the late Georgian aristocracy, the Belarusian and Kazakh late-Soviet elites) as well as the cases of low loyalty (the Yaitsa and early Don Cossacks, the early Georgian aristocracy, the Lithuanian and Latvian late-Soviet elites, the communities of the academic towns) are examined on the material of the Russian Empire and Soviet history. The comparative analysis of the national and local elites in their relations with the central government has shown that their basic social needs are satisfied by three main types of structures: (a) bureaucratic structures of the military and civil service providing formal status with appropriate material benefits and symbolic prestige; (b) patron-client networks; (c) self-governing egalitarian communities. Successful careers in state service were combined with a relatively high level of loyalty among local elites to the central government. Their preference for patron-client networks or self-governing communities as institutions satisfying basic social needs leads to a relatively lower level of loyalty to the center. A career in the state service is available for persons with a formally confirmed prestigious status and/or such qualities as diligence, discipline and accuracy, control of affects and suppression of aggression. Patron-client networks are established around individuals or groups with significant resources, such as economic, power, or symbolic capital, which give them a certain degree of independence from the local and, in some cases, even central government. The members of patron-client networks are expected to show unconditional loyalty, both through their actions and by participating in rituals that may conflict with official norms. Self-governing egalitarian communities attract deprived members of the middle and lower elites, as well as those seeking to join the elite. Membership in self-governing egalitarian communities requires such qualities as self-esteem, unwillingness to obey, demonstrative aggressiveness as a means of confirming one's own high status, contempt for symbolic attributes of social prestige.

DE loyalty; social status; symbolic prestige; social concerns; public
   service; patron-client networks; egalitarian communities
AB The article presents the conceptualization of loyalty (subordinates to superiors), the construction of the general theoretical hypothesis about the main causal factors of loyalty, as well as the analysis of the institutional contexts of the (dis)loyalty of local elites to the central government. Loyalty is understood as a variable characteristic of the political attitudes of actors (individuals and groups), combining recognition of the legitimacy of power, readiness to follow the adopted policy, obedience to orders, and reporting of reliable information about the state of affairs. Based on the general ideas of neo-Weberian political sociology, a hypothesis has been proposed about the basic factors that strengthen loyalty. The more an actor perceives a certain authority as providing his basic needs such as security, social status, income and influence (authority, political participation), the higher the actor's loyalty to this authority will be. The main types of institutions that allow elites to satisfy their basic needs are civil service, patron-client networks, and egalitarian communities. A relatively high level of loyalty to the central government is typical of the representatives of elites, whose basic needs are satisfied by taking prestigious positions in the public service. It is due to the symbolic and universal nature of status in bureaucratic structures of the military and civil service. The formal and broadly recognized status also allows avoiding the necessity of its constant confirmation by means of aggressive and violent actions. On the contrary, for a successful career within the military-bureaucratic structures of state service, qualities such as discipline, accuracy, diligence, and control over emotions are in demand. The status of the members of patron-client networks and egalitarian communities is informal and recognized only by their entourage (if the entourage is willing to do this). Therefore, participants of informal communities have to confirm their status, including aggressive and violent actions. In such a way, the qualities as a heightened sense of self-worth, emphasized aggressiveness (as a means of demonstrating and protecting status), and love of freedom are constituted, which are little compatible with the bureaucratic virtues of obedience and reverence for superiors. In addition, disdain for official values, symbols, norms and rules of interaction cultivated in communities guarantees that their participants will remain loyal to their patron and/or comrades and will not succumb to the temptation to exchange all this for a more predictable and stable career in public service.

TI CHALLENGES OF THE 'LANGUAGE OF INCLUSION': NAMING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY STUDIES

DT Article
DE inclusion; discourse about inclusion; people with mental disabilities;
   euphemisms
AB From a critical discourse analysis perspective, language not only reflects but also produces social, cultural, and political processes. This article focuses on public discourse, i.e. texts about inclusive projects, in particular workshops, for a broader audience, and analyzes the nomination of beneficiaries and how word choice influences their representation. The research data includes web texts; a table of nominations; web corpus data (to check frequency and date of first registration); interviews in which participants (with and without medical conditions) were asked to express their attitudes towards certain expressions and to share their experiences. The article examines interpretations of the term 'people with mental peculiarities,' as well as current ideologies and reasons why it is problematic. Many expressions differ in their euphemistic and binding nature: 'people with peculiarities,' which can be 'mental', 'intellectual', or 'developmental', 'with impairments', 'mental' or'intellectual';'with mental disabilities'; expressions with the adjectives 'special', 'peculiar', 'neurodivergent' etc. Although many of these terms are used as synonyms, they may, with additional connotations, denote categories that overlap only partially, and differ in the ideologies behind them. The main features highlighted are the variability and euphemistic nature of the names, as well as the novelty of some of them. 'The language of inclusion' is also euphemistic in a broader sense, as it is being formed, searching for correct expressions to designate those meanings and categories that constitute a social problem, proposing new ethical models. This language is aimed at those who are involved in the field and may not be clear to non-specialists. This is due both to the way this language works (dealing with professional fields and taking into account progressive ideologies) and to the lack of awareness.

   Britain; Britain Empire; Anglo-American relations
AB This article is devoted to the role of the British politician Harold Macmillan in the Suez Crisis of 1956. Based on British archival documents and MacMillan's personal diary, this article recreates a double game played by the head of the Treasury. Harold Macmillan belongs to the number of British politicians whose biographies have many "white spots", carefully hidden by themselves and their surroundings. One of these gaps is the activity of Macmillan as the Chancellor of the Exchequer during the Suez Crisis of 1956. From the very beginning of the aggravation of the situation in the Middle East, caused by the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company by the Egyptian government of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Macmillan advocated for a military operation against Egypt. Moreover, he was the first who proposed to involve Israel in this operation in the summer of 1956. The hesitation of the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden, who was afraid to start military actions in the Middle East without the support of the United States, did not suit the head of the British treasury. In order to convince Eden of the need to start a forceful operation against Egypt as soon as possible, Macmillan distorted the information about the negotiations that he held at the end of September 1956 in Washington with the US President Dwight Eisenhower and the Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. The American allies of London were not against overthrowing Nasser, but insisted that military actions in Egypt should not start before the presidential elections in the US. Macmillan presented the latter condition as optional, emphasizing the readiness of the United States to support the military operation against Egypt. The start of the aggression against Egypt in the midst of the election campaign in the US caused irritation in the administration of Eisenhower. According to Macmillan, the United States threatened to stop financial aid to Great Britain, which forced the latter to end the military operation in the Suez Canal zone. However, there is no other data on the American pressure, except for the words of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, repeated later in his memoirs. All this allows ranking Harold Macmillan among the number of the main architects of the Suez Crisis, skillfully combining the implementation of the imperial line of behavior with his own political calculations.

AB The article deals with the problem of social self-determination of student youth and the influence on this process of regional identification caused by the entry of the Trans-Baikal Territory into the Far Eastern Federal District. The authors present the results and conclusions of a questionnaire survey of students of Trans-Baikal universities conducted within the framework of a large-scale sociological project "Social Self-Determination of Youth in the Formation of a New Regional Identity (Based on the Materials of the TransBaikal Territory and the Republic of Buryatia)". The project is based on the idea of the interrelation between two scientific categories - "regional identity" and "social selfdetermination". Moreover, regional identity is considered not only as a traditionally and historically grounded territorial and cultural identification, but as an artificially created geographical, economically conditioned territorial reality, which originates from November 4, 2018, when the Trans- Baikal Territory and the Republic of Buryatia were transferred from the Siberian Federal District to the Far Eastern Federal District by the Decree of President Vladimir Putin. The authors understand social self-determination as the inclusion of a person in all spheres of society, a person's awareness and achievement of a stable position in the system of social relations. The components of social self-determination of student youth were identified: socio-professional self-determination, socio-political self-determination and socio-cultural self-determination within the framework of the studied missile defense. The analysis of the survey results allowed the authors to determine: (1) the most typical professional and motivational profiles and strategies of professional self-determination of Trans-Baikal students; (2) political orientations and attitudes of Trans-Baikal student youth in socio-political self-determination; (3) value orientations and life position in socio-cultural self-determination. The authors used the method of "layer proximity" identifying the level of regional identification of students of Trans-Baikal universities. The analysis of the identification profiles of the interviewed students showed that the new regional reality (I am a Far Easterner), artificially created for certain state purposes, has not yet entered the consciousness of the student youth and is not perceived by them as "close" and "native". But in fact this is a strategic level of regional identity associated with the construction of a new regional image, the positioning of a new territorial entity, the invention of new territorial traditions and the formation of a new symbolic policy.

DE early Cossack communities; social origins; stage affiliation; male
   unions; comparative historical analysis
AB Introduction. Addressing the complex and controversial problem of domestic Cossack studies - the determination of the stage affiliation of early Slavic Cossack communities - the author sets himself the task of summing up many years of discussions, identifying the most promising directions for further research, and identifying the associated methodological guidelines. Methods and materials. Many studies of the problem of the stage affiliation of early Cossack communities, carried out by pre-revolutionary, Soviet, and modern Russian Cossack researchers, as well as works on male unions and communities of the Slavic, Caucasian, and Turkic worlds, served as materials for the article. The analysis of sources and scientific publications was carried out using comparative historical and structural- functional methods, as well as methods of classification and typologization. Analysis. The available scientific papers on the problem were classified based on the social and political prototypes of early Cossack communities determined by scientists. Three groups of versions about the social nature of early Cossack communities have been identified, which correlate them: 1) with state structures; 2) with paramilitary communities that existed in the South Russian steppes and adjacent territories at the same time as the Cossacks; 3) with archaic structures (the so-called military democracy and male unions). Results. Defining the third direction as the most promising, the author of the article suggests expanding research on the cultural and historical comparison of Cossack organizations with archaic male unions and their later forms known in the Turkic, Caucasian, and Slavic worlds. We should start this case by adhering to a set of crucial methodological principles. These principles indicate that male unions were cultural universals, and their correlation with Cossack organizations may indicate not so much (and not only) genetic connections as typological ones. In contrast to the Caucasian and Central Asian unions, Cossack communities arose outside the metropolis, which, on the one hand, led to the need for them to build their own potestar structures and, on the other hand, determined the strong external impact on them from the Russian state. The development of Cossack communities did not follow the path of evolution but was first carried out in the form of a rollback to the archaic and then was associated with a series of sociocultural transformations.

ID MILITARY-INTERVENTION; RESPONSIBILITY
AB This paper, for the first time in Russian science, outlines the evolution of ancient Chinese views on humanitarian intervention and their potential use in Beijing's modification of the contemporary concept of humanitarian intervention and the 'responsibility to protect' (R2P) initiative. There are good reasons to believe that the concept of humanitarian intervention was formulated for the first time in the world history of thought in China during the Warring States period (5(th)-3(rd) centuries BC). Its functional equivalents were the terms zhu (sic) 'judgement/punishment' and zheng (sic) 'expedition,' used in the discussions of the 'sage kings of antiquity' (g-zhi sheng wang (sic)(sic)(sic)(sic), semi-legendary exemplary cultural heroes and dynastic founders) and in the discourse on the 'proper [use of] military force' ( yi-bing (sic)(sic)), an ancient Chinese equivalent of the just war theory. The views on humanitarian intervention evolved from 'divine intervention' (i.e. military actions as the execution of heavenly judgment, till the beginning of the 3 rd century BC) to 'humanitarian intervention' (military actions as a means for rescuing the people from the villainous government, by the end of the 3 rd century BC). Beijing's use of this tradition might create a greater scope for legitimizing political actions that meet the interests and values of the PRC, thus raising the legitimacy bar of humanitarian intervention, and helping to specify the methods and mechanisms of peaceful conflict resolution under the R2P. The main aspects of the 'sinicization' of modern humanitarian intervention, taking into account the ancient Chinese ethics of war, can be an alternative conceptualization of the political space, an emphasis on the morality of a legitimate actor, a criterion of popular approval, a rethinking of jus in bello and jus post bellum as verifiers of jus ad bellum, the distinction between a regime change and a ruler change, and a focus on intervention as the last resort.

DT Article
DE civil religion; political religion; values; sacredness; communication
AB The article presents a conceptual analysis of civil religion as a special form of combining the sacred and the political. Having stated the need for social researchers to address the religious side of society in general and its political implications in particular, the author tries not only to reconstruct the genealogy of the term "civil religion", but also to trace the differences between civil and political religion. Based on the analysis of the origins of the concept of civil religion, the author shows that its components - "civil" and "religious" - were introduced from two sources that are completely different in their spirit: the social philosophy of Jean -Jacques Rousseau and the sociological project of Emile Durkheim. Robert Bellah managed to combine the heuristics of both sources and offer a specific language for describing externally secular, but internally religious societies. Having thoroughly analyzed the three features of civil religion identified by Bellah, the author focuses on its functioning as a communication environment - a specific set of values that taboo or stimulate the articulation of certain political issues. The communication environment not only ensures the satisfaction of the needs of the state, within which a civil -religious cult is established, but also maintains a consensus on basic values, the undermining of which is fraught with the complete disintegration of society. According to the author's conclusion, in order to talk about the presence of a civil religion in a polity, this polity must meet several criteria, including unambiguous consensus about sacred values, political decision -making justified via theology and values, as well as the "topological" nature of the development of a political cult. This is the main reason why this form of political life is relatively rare.

ID RUSSIA
AB This article analyzes how, in the past years, Russia's political discourse has concentrated on the Country's place and role in the modern world and how top-down political communication seems to have somewhat succeeded in affecting the population's political culture and reviving old ideologies. The armed conflict declared by Russia against Ukraine seems to have had the effect of strengthening - once again- the polarization between the West and the East. New geopolitical arrangements and new power relations are being reorganized, and, in this process, political cultures and ideologies seem to be reshaped. In particular, the data from Russian national surveys on the population's political values and the analysis of political discourses show that Russia seems to have dusted off its old socialist ideology, emphasizing its nationalistic and neo-imperial traits while deepening its neo-authoritarian turn. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and a short period of de-ideologization, the Russian government has repeatedly attempted to develop a nationwide general civil ideology, mainly using the concepts of the "Russian world" and of "neo-Eurasianism", considered as neo-imperial ideologies, that determined the content of public discourse in Russia. Nationalism is both an ideology and a political practice based on the value of the nation as the highest form of social unity. This kind of nationalism is widely used by states through official rhetoric, symbols and ideological institutions (education, social sciences, mass media) to assert civil loyalty and disseminate national legal norms and cultural values. (Tishkov, 2021). Nationalism and Neo-conservatism have become of particular importance to Russian society, and during the last decade, they have become the core of the Country's political actions and rhetoric. Neoconservatism includes a set of different ideological patterns such as nationalism, imperial claims, orientations on special ways of Russia, the priority of traditional values, etc., which are accompanied by authoritarian tendencies in the political process (A. Panarin, 1994, Dugin 2000). In this way, it seems correct to affirm that the neo-conservative ideology becomes the sociocultural base of the whole process of power legitimization. In this context and in the frames of the actual political system, no political movement, party, or group of interests can act as a real competitor of the federal government, which has built its ethnopolitics not only on the idea of uniting different nations of the Russian Federation but also on ideas of irredentism. This is not totally new. If in the 90s, political discourse and public dialogue were dominated by the idea of democratization and of transition from an authoritarian to an open society, only a decade later, as early as Putin's first mandate, political discourse started to turn to the idea of "stability" and of "sustainability of the system and of the welfare state", coupled with the idea of a so-called "conservative modernization" that essentially implied the beginning of a new era of anti-reformism and a nostalgic call for the Socialist past. In this article, moving from a neo-Marxist perspective on the concept of Political Culture (Burlackij, 1970; Markiewicz, 1971; Wiatr, 1980), we will analyze how these political ideas and values have turned into a political culture that seems coherent with the above mentioned neo-imperial nationalist ideology, and, most importantly, that is inclined to support it.
   Whereas the Russians who do not support the regime, seem far from being capable of displaying a coherent and alternative political culture, let alone organizing a different political programme that could activate a counteroffensive. While taking into account public speeches from prominent political leaders, the empirical basis of the article derives from the data of the all-Russia annual sociological monitoring "How do you live, Russia" (1992-2023) carried out by the Institute of Socio-Political Research- Branch of the Federal Centre of Theoretical and Applied Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, through a survey on a sample of 14001800 respondents, representative of all the Russian population. As we will see, the data shows that new forms of civic nationalism are largely based on nostalgic sympathies for the Soviet past and a new civil identity, formed successfully during the post-soviet period, is increasingly affirming itself.

DT Article
DE scientific forecasting; monitoring; ethnic processes
AB Ethnological monitoring organization models, tested since the early 1990s in the subjects of the Russian Federation, are considered in the article. Particular attention is paid to the problem of scientific forecasting algorithm forming of the ethno-social situation change, using the principles of three methodological approaches- process, systemic and selective. The systematic approach is determined by the fact that the object of monitoring is a dynamic complex and multi-level system (complex) of social communications- political, socio-economic, socio-cultural. Only some of them are traditional (stochastic). The ethnic component of the structure of social relations (between social institutions) manifests itself in an extremely wide spectrum: from the ethnic sectors of the rural and urban economy with elements of network organization to the system of communications of cultural and confessional associations with local governments. The process approach has a two-component sructure. On the one hand, monitoring itself should be considered as a complex of interdependent processes with clearly expressed actors (participants) of the process, their social attitudes, the algorithm (sequence) of research of the current situation. Based on the algorithm of the structural-functional analysis, the persons involved in this process (both legal and physical) are divided (by function) into three groups: a) "responsible" for organizing the process and implementing its results in political practice; b) "executors"- organizers of the ethnosocial situation investigation- representatives of the expert community; c) "participants"- persons and organizations indirectly involved in the monitoring deployment/ The persons (both legal and physical) involved in this process, based on the structural-functional analysis algorithm, are divided (by function) into three groups: a) "responsible" for organizing the process and implementing its results in political practice; b) "executors"- organizers and representatives of the expert community; c) "participants"- persons and organizations indirectly involved in monitoring. According to the author, the object of modern monitoring (as a procedure) is not so much social processes that initiate the national (state) and group (ethnic) interests clash, but indicators of socio-economic, ethno-social and ethno-cultural situation (environment). The use of these indicators does not expand the possibilities of scientific forecasting of the ethnosocial situation change, but on the contrary, narrows them. In this regard, it is proposed to consider the materials of monitoring studies as an independent group of sources to identify the intersection of latent forms of ethnic processes- ethnic structure and settlement system changes, traditional social organization and subsistence systems transformation, political consolidation, migrant adaptation, assimilation, and traditional culture commodification. Reorientation of the object of ethnological monitoring on ethnic processes objectively promotes: applied anthropology of the subject area change; expansion of chronological framework (up to two centuries); principles of sampling approach. With the change of the subject area there is a prospect of the formation of databases to analyze the relationship of politi- cal history and ethnic history of the peoples of Russia.

AB . The image of the future of youth is described in this paper and its relationship with the subjective space of politics is identified. The article provides a brief analysis of research on the image of the future within the framework of social and political sciences, describes the main theoretical approaches to analyzing the future image of youth. The authors give their own conceptual definition of the future image as a component of the political subjective space, a set of symbolic, ideological and cultural meanings that determine the orientation and behavior of various political actors. The authors as a methodology use focus group interviews, online questionnaires of youth representatives in order to verify the conceptual model of the study. The dynamic nature of the future image as a part of political subjective space is determined by a system of institutions, agents and factors of socialization. Five key components have been identified in the structure of the future image: content, value, emotions, activity and technology. Four projection levels of the future image are defined: personal, group, projection at the level of the macro community and global. The study indicates the predominance of personal projection in the respondents' ideas about the future. Despite the presence of worries and fears for their personal future, young people are generally confident in their own future and believe that the Russian state will continue to play an important role as a world power. An important characteristic of the future image is the subjectivity of its bearer, the degree of activity or proactivity and the willingness to take responsibility for their own future and the future of their families, local community, region, country, and the world. Locus control, that is, a subjective assessment of the factors (personal efforts or external circumstances) on which the future depends, according to the study, is associated with the degree of confidence in the future, the formation of a positive future image. The predominance of civic identity in the hierarchy of identities is also revealed. Young people feel responsible for the future of their country. At the moment, Russian civic identity has a positive impact on the future image of young people. It is significant that among students studying in the Luhansk People's Republic, the level of concern about the future is higher, the level of civil identity is lower, which indicates that the task of forming civil identity should be prioritized in the new regions of the Russian Federation.

AB In the history of left-wing forces, there are numerous lacunae that were ousted from the collective memory by the dominant political currents, which suppressed and displaced dissident and minority ideological and political movements. Such a forgotten and "lost" link in the evolution of left-wing, Marxist thought is humanistic socialism, a striking representative of which was the outstanding Italian-Argentine philosopher and publicist Rodolfo Mondolfo, whose works had a great influence on the formation of the "New Left" and on the formation of concepts of democratic socialism not only in Latin America, but also in Europe. His ideas were based on the development of the philosophy of praxis in opposition to the determinism and voluntarism of orthodox Marxism. His vision of socialism focused on the problem of overcoming the alienation of the human, the commodity fetishism of the capitalist system, on the problems of moral revolution, freedom and democracy. In the 1960s and 1970s, his writings were at the center of political discussions among the New Left, in particular around the ideological legacy of A. Gramsci. This article purports to analyze his views and discussions in the left-wing intellectual sector in the 1960s and 1970s in Latin America.

AB The article is dedicated to the speech "On Drawing" by the honorary member of the Imperial Academy of Arts, Prince Dmitry Alekseevich Golitsyn (1734-1803), which he delivered in July 1769 at a solemn public meeting of the Academy. Its text was discovered in the Russian State Historical Archive in the middle of the 20th th century and was long considered his original work, written first in French and then translated into Russian. The main outcome of the research conducted by the authors of this article was the discovery of the original source of this text by Golitsyn, namely the beginning of the dialogue of the same title from the French edition of the book by the English traveler and writer Daniel Webb "Recherches sur les beaut & eacute;s de la peinture" (1765). Since the Englishman's book was the result of his tour to Rome, where he has met the scholar J. J. Winckelmann and the painter A. R. Mengs, an amateur art historian, Webb, retelling in his essay the thoughts of German theorists about imitation of ancient artists, unwittingly became a transmission link in the arrival of neoclassical ideas to Russia. Denis Diderot got acquainted with the French translation of Webb's book before Golitsyn, wrote an essay about it for F. M. Grimm's "La Correspondance litt & eacute;raire" and, apparently, recommended it to the prince. However, Golitsyn did not copy word-for-word Webb's text, but adapted it for his purpose - to compose a program speech to the high assembly of Russia's main educational institution in the field of fine arts, which is gaining strength. Unlike Wincklemann and Webb, who appealed exclusively to the past, the Russian aristocrat, following Diderot, saw the future progress of modern art not in blind imitation of ancient masters, but in the revival of the emotional and intellectual power of ancient art through the efforts of free artists. The political conditions of the Russian Empire during the reign of Catherine II predetermined the laudatory tone of his speech in the spirit of the absolute monarchy of Louis XIV.

Among the methods used in this study are psychoanalytic theories of the subject, particularly the model of the "prosthetic" subject; concepts of neoliberalism, as formulated by W. Brown; and biopolitical logics of power and society. The main problem of this study is how the body of the subject is transformed under conditions of neoliberalism undergoing technological change. This question involves answering several additional questions, including: What is meant by " technology"? How is neoliberalism conceptually implemented? How is the individual connected to their body in modern society? Within the framework of the proposed model of an individual as a prosthetic entity, it is demonstrated how splitting and dysfunctional identity occurs. The findings of this study are presented in the following theses. The "prosthetic body" is currently experiencing a crisis due to the current state of development in society. Aspects of physicality such as appearance and voice no longer entirely belong to individuals, becoming commodities for exchange. There is a separation not only from products of a person's labor, which is typical of capitalism, but also from individual organs and parts of the body. This results in a "split" of the physical self, granting autonomous existence to mechanical organs and prosthetics as well as other organs within the body. Technology acts as a mediating element in this process of disconnection. The current state of the individual reflects a crisis, manifested in an imagined space where the self splits. The key findings of this study are as follows. It is necessary to develop a new model for the subjectivation and structure of the individual taking into account changes taking place in modern society. Future research could focus on the impact of recent technologies on human subjectivity and physical bodies while considering current social events.

AB The article examines the connection between protests and elections in an authoritarian context. Using the concept of mobilization mo-mentum, the authors attempt to find out whether intensive and massive col-lective actions on the eve of elections can affect electoral mobilization and support for the "party in power", and if so, in what direction. Based on the modern literature on this topic, the authors identify two alternative models of the possible electoral effect of the mobilization momen-tum. According to the first model, by breaking through the information blo-ckade and signaling to citizens about the widespread dissatisfaction with the authorities' policies, intense mass protests contribute to an increase in voters' turnout and a decrease in support for pro-government forces. According to the second model, such protests may easily increase the electoral performance of the "party in power," since they often lead to the mobilization of an electorate that is loyal to the ruling circles. The authors test these hypotheses against the evidence from the 2011-2016 parliamentary electoral cycle in Russia using methods of standard mul-tiple linear regression, difference-in-differences and synthetic control. The results are mixed. It appears that the mobilization momentum has a weak electoral effect or even a positive effect on the performance of the "party in power," but its influence may depend on threshold values: in the most protest-ing cities, support for the United Russia turns out to be lower than it would be in the absence of the mobilization momentum. At the same time, the findings convincingly demonstrate that the evidence and data from the Russian con-text, combined with modern methods of analysis, opens up an excellent op-portunity for research at the intersection of the spheres of political participa-tion and electoral politics.

ID COMICS
AB This research focuses on an urgent phenomenon of modern culture - specific features of graphic adaptations of Russian literary texts, i.e. such kind of art, in which a work of fiction is fully visualized by the author of the comic book. In recent years, this kind of art is becoming more and more popular in Russia, which is to a large extent associated with clip thinking, multiculturalism and globalization, involving both economic, political, social, and cultural spheres of life. Comic books and graphic adaptations occupy an important place among the interests ofyoung people and constitute a significant constituent of expressing subjectness and individuality of the modern youth. They allow the young people to get acquainted with Russian literature and to acquire and process value-based benchmarks of previous generations. The practical research material encompasses graphic adaptations of the most prominent Russian works of literature, such as "Crime and Punishment" by F. Dostoevsky, "Anna Karenina" by L. Tolstoy, "The Master and Margarita" by M. Bulgakov. The study employs the methods of literary semiotics and hermeneutics, and the methods of creolized text analysis - texts of a mixed syncretic nature that involve verbal and visual semiotic codes. The study also uses methods and techniques which are typical of cinematography. The investigation of the Russian literary text transformations, made by Russian and foreign painters, provides a new insight on the intercultural nature of graphic adaptations. By comparing the structure, semantic peculiarities, and visual techniques of Russian and foreign graphic adaptations, it is possible to discover the dominant points of the pre-text works of art, and to identify salient episodes that often attract the attention of the painters. The analysis of the graphic adaptations of Russian works of literature considered in this article make it possible to conclude that this genre is genetically connected with the art of comics, but is more complex and multifaceted. The graphic adaptation absorbs the features of film and theater art, which is expressed in montage techniques and script plan writing. The genre of graphic adaptation actualizes the visual potential of many classic and modern works of Russian literature and participates in modern intercultural communication along with other kinds of art.

AB The article aims to develop methodological tools capable of presenting an explanatory model of the relationship between the concepts of "pan- Islamism - pan-Turkism" within the framework of Russian power discourse. The analysis of historiography and texts from historical sources makes it possible to assume the existence of the concept sphere "pan-Islamism - panTurkism", which is an ordered set of generalizing units of thought reflecting fl ecting and interpreting global phenomena depending on the knowledge, individual experience, specialty, and social status of a native speaker. For the fi rst time in Russian historiography, an attempt is being made to comprehensively analyze the intellectual genealogy of the concepts of pan-Islamism and panTurkism using a dynamic model of the conceptual sphere. To understand the essence of the interaction of these concepts each other, this model analyzes the historical evolution of the definitions fi nitions of "pan-Islamism" and "pan-Turkism", which formed a significant fi cant part of the Russian power discourse of the late 19th th - fi rst third of the 20th th centuries. Exploring the intellectual genealogy of these terms within the framework of Russian power discourse, the authors state the irreducibility of both concepts to one, their non-identity. The analysis of published and archival materials containing interpretations and assessments of these phenomena by Russian elites of different political spectrum confirms the thesis that the elements of this conceptual sphere are in dynamic interaction with each other, when under the influence of a combination of socio-political circumstances one of them could dominate, but not displace the other from the power discourse. It is concluded that the correlation of concepts within the "pan-Islamism - pan-Turkism" conceptual sphere itself is influenced by a set of objective circumstances related to the development of ethnic consciousness of peoples, the specifics of the historical development of the Muslim Ummah and its regional parts, and the worldview of Muslims themselves. The formulations proposed by imperial, anti-Bolshevik and Soviet political leaders in relation to these phenomena largely echoed: there was also distrust of the ideas of the community of "Muslim" peoples, the similarity in the characteristics of the formation of national identity within the framework of the cultural reformation of Volga-Ural and Crimean Muslims, the emphasis on the special role of the Volga-Ural Tatars in this process, the secondary nature of pan-Turkism, and the intertwining and mixing of concepts to the point of indistinguishability. It is proved that the proposed research approach, the "conceptosphere" model, allows a more objective look at the assessments made by those who generated expert knowledge, managerial approaches towards Russian Muslims and Islam in general in the late Imperial and early Soviet periods.

DE Julius Aikhenvald; reception of Shakespeare; Shakespeare studies;
   literary studies; criticism; immanent method; objectivity; subjective
   criticism
AB The research problem concerns the evolution of critical views of Julius Isaevich Aikhenvald (1872-1928) in relation to his perception of William Shakespeare's creativity. The aim of the study is to trace how changes in the critic's personal fate and the global political situation led to his reevaluation of Shakespeare's images. The material consists of little-known articles by the critic, published both in Russia in the 1910s-1920s and in emigration (mainly in the emigrant newspaper "Rul"). Hermeneutical, historical-cultural, and comparative methods were used for the research. It is established that in the pre-revolutionary period, Julius Aikhenvald, following his subjective immanent method of criticism, evaluates Shakespeare as a universal genius (in particular, comparing him to Leo Tolstoy). The most important characteristic becomes the universality of the playwright's artistic attention, allowing to reflect all aspects of existence, beyond any hierarchies. In particular, Aikhenvald implicitly speaks about Shakespeare's moral relativism. However, in the emigrant period, using Shakespeare's images (primarily the images of Caliban and Coriolanus) to analyze the historical situation in the USSR, he comes to affirm the objectivity of good and truth as characteristics of literature and social reality.

AB The article deals with the discussions that accompanied the work of the Special Council on drafting a new press statute in 1905. The Council, also known as the << D. F. Kobeko Commission >>, worked from February 10 to December 18, 1905. The minutes of its meetings, which served as the main source for the study, were deposited in the personal fund of the prominent statesman and public figure, lawyer A. F. Koni in the State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF). Researchers who approached them earlier were primarily interested in the institutional aspects of the activity of the The Special Council: the procedure for its formation, composition, course and results of the meetings. The participants in the discussion, with their views, ideas and proposals, remained in the background. Meanwhile at the The Special Council was represented the expert community, organized on the authorities` initiative. In addition to officials, lawyers, publishers, journalists and public figures of various views were involved in drafting the new press law. This determined the problematic nature and acuteness of the discussions. During the meetings of the Special Council, the positions of the two most significant and influential groups of the Russian public - the ideological supporters and the convinced opponents of the reforms - were formulated and determined. Representatives of each of them were guided by different worldviews that determined their political and social position. In their judgments, which for the first time are considered comprehensively in historiography, they went much further than the issues of the press. Their discussions revealed their positions on the key issues of Russian public thought in 1905: representation of the people, constitutional state, political and civil liberties and revolution. The intellectual history`s methodology made it possible to place the statements of the members of the Council in a broad socio-political context. And the use of additional (mostly unpublished) office documents allowed to determine to what extent the Special Council corresponded to the key trends of the state policy in the field of press and propaganda. And to what extent the << D. F. Kobeko Commission >> foresaw and determined these trends. On the basis of the study it is concluded that in 1905 the Russian public was widely integrated into the lawmaking process. This cooperation did not always bring legislative fruits. But it significantly changed the political agenda, considerably narrowing the << boundaries of permissible >> for the supreme power.

   carbon neutrality; emissions trading system; carbon regulation;

ID TRADING SCHEME; COMPETITIVENESS
AB Emissions trading systems are essential for combating climate change and the energy transition because they create incentives to limit and control emissions. However, there is also a perception that taxing pollutants is a more effective way to limit emissions than setting caps on pollution. This creates an ambiguity in which taxation predicts the cost of collective action but not the volume of emissions. Caps, on the other hand, make pollution quantifiable but not its cost. Emissions trading systems, which set a ceiling on pollutants but allow companies to set a price on the market by trading allowances within the cap, provide an alternative to this ambiguity. However, the issue of equitable allocation of allowances to developing countries and the most vulnerable countries remains. The importance of allowances is directly related to political stability, as governments implement measures and instruments to regulate greenhouse gas trade, including incentives, financial incentives and accountability. In general, emission quotas are no less a political task than an economic one, since the fight against global warming is a global public good and does not fit into standard market mechanisms. The purpose of the study is to develop a model for distributing quotas forprivate mathematical calculations that takes into account country variables and allows, based on the level of industrial development, calculation of quotas, as well as the environmental friendliness of production factors. The methodology is presented by mathematical modeling methods through the creation of an equilibrium model for calculating the distribution of emission quotas. As a result of the study, the authors developed a multicomponent heterogeneous equilibrium model for calculating the distribution of greenhouse gas emission quotas, taking into account not only the volume of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) but also the volume of GDP per capita, which prevents excessive underquoting of developing countries, as well as separately regulating the quota system for the poorest countries.

AB The paper is devoted to the analysis of the scientific links of Soviet and French molecular biologists and biochemists in the second half of the 1970s. This cooperation is associated with the names of the prominent Russian and French scientists. The pioneers of this cooperation were Academicians A.A. Baev, Yu.A. Ovchinnikov, A.S. Spirin, L.L. Kiselev, and other Soviet scientists, and Marianne Grunberg-Manago, Fran & ccedil;ois Gros, and Jean-Pierre Ebel, on the French side. Despite the fact that RussianA/ Soviet-French scientific links, including contacts in the field of biology, are to some extent represented in Russian and foreign literature, only the first steps have been taken in studying the effective interaction of molecular biologists and biochemists of the two countries. Soviet-French scientific cooperation manifested most vividly in the symposia devoted to "Physico-chemical origin of life", the first of which was held in 1974. Until the mid-1990s, symposia were regularly held alternately in USSR/Russia and France. The author analyzes Soviet-French collaboration in the context of international political situation. Specifically, the research provides comparison between Soviet-French and Soviet-American scientific links. The paper is based on the wide range of new archival sources, first of all on the documents from the funds of the Main directorate of the foreign relations of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Institute of molecular biology and memoirs. The author studies the symposium in Tashkent (1977) and the results of the foreign trips of Soviet researchers. The paper concludes about achievements in the development of Soviet-French scientific links. Despite the deteriorating international situation, the symposia continued. Due to the trips to France Soviet scientists were familiarizing with the level of research abroad and were receiving valuable experience. At the same, time the author touches upon the difficulties that hindered international contacts. These problems were common for the Soviet science and were caused by the Cold War and the Iron Curtain.

AB Higher education as aAsocial institution of society has aAlong history of development. Thus, during most stages of institutional development, universities had two functions: educational and research. However, recently in scientific discussions the problem of the so- called "third role" has become increasingly relevant, which is considered by scientists as the social positioning of the university, which goes beyond the boundaries of the educational institution itself. In this regard, the purpose of the scientific ific article is to try to concretize the phenomenon of the "third role": its components, characteristics, and other data. The study draws on a wide range of sources of both domestic and foreign expertise. The work of M. Markle and A. Paustist attracts attention, as they are "pioneers" in the methodology for identifying the "third role" of modern higher educational institutions. As for Russian specialists, N.A. Medushevsky, S.E. Sorokin, E.V. Kudryashova and other scientists made a great contribution to the problem study. The article consists of several parts: statement of the problem, approaches to understanding the "third role", the "third role" in research on the history of universities, the "third role" of modern Russian universities in the focus of research, as well as the conclusion. The main conclusion that can be reached while reading the article is the need to seriously delve into the history of the "third role" issue. Modern articles and other types s of publications in rare cases focus specifically on the historical essence of the phenomenon. More economic, cultural, and other local manifestations of it can be found in the example of individual higher educational institutions. In this regard, there is no systematic historical understanding of the third role and everything that is not related to the first two functions of the university: educational and research. Therefore, history as a science is faced with the task of systematic research, which will show the university as a huge complex of cultural, political and other spheres of life of a city, region, country.

DE literacy myth; standard language; language ideology; writing;

AB The article examines the literacy myth and its ideological foundations. The literacy myth plays a significant role in shaping educational policies and practices, but at the same time it can obscure important sociolinguistic issues such as linguistic inequalities, discrimination based on accent or dialect, and fail to recognize the diversity of forms and levels of literacy. The aim of the research in the article is a deep understanding of the genesis and functioning of the literacy myth in modern society. This myth does not exist independently - it is part of a system of other myths. The article shows that the literacy myth is based on the standard language myth, which in turn is based on the idea of the nation-state. Therefore, along with the task of analyzing the ideological foundations of the literacy myth, the authors also make an attempt to identify and deconstruct the designated myths of a higher levels. Since literacy is closely related to writing, certain parts of the article are also devoted to this issue. To achieve the research objectives, the article uses an integrated approach: (1) to analyze the literacy myth, the concept of 'multiliteracies' by Brian Street and the method of critical analysis of the literacy myth by Harvey R. Graff are used; (2) in order to deconstruct the standard language myth, Roland Barthes' approach to the description of the myth is used, as well as Rosina Lippi-Green's model of language subordination process; (3) the idea of the nation-state is viewed through the lens of the concepts of 'imagined communities' by Benedict Anderson and 'invented tradition' by Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger. The article highlights how the literacy myth is used as a tool to maintain and exclude social hierarchies, and how this can hinder access to education and other opportunities for all layers of society. The authors show the need to study alternative approaches to literacy (that would contribute to social justice), including broader ones that take into consideration the impact of digitalization and the emergence of new myths on this basis.

AB The problem of the disintegration of our country has arisen several times: the first time - as the disintegration of the Russian Empire, the second time - as the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Since the situation of disintegration has been consistently repeated, this process cannot be regarded as accidental. Among its causes is the ideology of regionalism. It emerged in the 19th th century as a response to the colonial policy of the centre towards the outlying territories. Regionalism was inseparably linked to the life of Grigory Ivanovich Gurkin (1870-1937), the first painter of the Altai landscape, having affected him three times. For the first time, at the turn of the 19th th and 20th th centuries, regionalism helped a representative of the minority from the Altai to become a professional artist. The work of the spiritual mission in the Altai, with all its peculiarity, was objectively the embodiment of regionalists' dream about elementary education of national minorities. Gurkin's painstaking mastering of literacy and icon painting, allowed him not only to develop creative abilities, but also to get acquainted through A. V. Anokhin with the leader of the Siberian regionalists G. N. Potanin. Friendship with Potanin, Anohin, and other representatives of the Siberian regionalism, promoted political awakening of the Altai landscape painter. After October events of 1917, Gurkin turned from assimilation of ideas of regionalism to their direct realization in political activity. For the third time, the ideas of regionalism were actualized at the turn of the 20th th and 21st st centuries, when the national elite of the Altai Republic transformed Gurkin into a key figure of ethnic solidarity.

DE political mythology; symbolic image/representation; serpent-fighting
   myth-motif; meanings; actualizations; Orthodox theology
AB The medieval state in Rus' was constituted and symbolized as a Christian institution, and its quintessence was the image of the sovereign. To fill the significant image with meaning, the mythological motif of serpent fighting, the struggle of the Hero with the Enemy, was used. This was demonstrated both by visual representations (icons, seals, coat of arms) and by the official nomination "tsar", which acquired a special Orthodox mystical meaning. The sacralization of the image of the Russian sovereign and state was based on the Byzantine model of a universal empire, in which the tsar was the vicar of Christ on earth, being his "living" incarnation. As a result, the role of Moscow, this already transcendental state, called by virtue of symbolic continuity the "Third Rome", and the tsar were associated with the extension of the life of the fourth world Christian kingdom in the context of the coming end of the world. This last kingdom, it was believed in medieval Moscow, was already an established Orthodox power, united in the universe, headed by a truly Orthodox tsar, hence the main political function of the tsar was to protect Orthodoxy from enemies. Thus, on the basis of the construction of the heroic myth, a complete and all-encompassing world of meaning was built, and the political order was legitimized in its ultimate meaning, in its correlation with the divine cosmic order. The ideas of Russian Orthodox theology of the 18th-20th centuries concerning what should be done in the construction of Russian statehood are based on ideas about the God's chosenness of the Russian people, the religious mission of Rus' and its tsar, formed during the period of the Principality of Moscow. Meanwhile, the theology of this period also has its own specifics. The new political reality, characterized by the fact that Russia, with the beginning of the church reform of Peter the Great, took the path of state secularization, gives a special tone to discussions about the nature of Russian statehood. The theological thought of this period is distinguished by an attempt to substantiate the need for a return to traditional values, which, according to the authors, constitute the basis of Russian statehood. Particular hope for a return to the "old models" rests with the Russian people, who are assigned a heroic role - to be the savior of the state. Ideas about the mystical nature of the Russian state are updated today through speeches and statements of political and religious leaders, in which political power is represented in mythical-heroic motifs, and Russia appears as a defender of traditional values and world Orthodoxy, a state with a messianic role in the modern world.

AB The article considers issues of the effectiveness of personnel policy pursued in public authorities, the understanding of the conceptual foundations, parameters and criteria that determine its effectiveness, as well as the reflection of its maturity in the practice of working with the personnel reserve. The article draws attention to the essence of personnel policy in the context of unlocking managerial potential, developing human and social capital. The authors emphasize that the implementation of personnel policy in public authorities is based on various conceptual, methodological and technological foundations, which increases the bifurcation of the management systems themselves. The development of management systems is viewed through the prism of value-normative compliance and coherence, which reflects the identity of the vision of strategic goals and expected results. Currently, a request is being formed in the field of forecasting based on big data of non-obvious dependencies, the formation of multivariate scenarios and possible solutions in a dynamic environment. The article substantiates the relationship between the maturity of personnel policy, the quality of personnel analytics and the effectiveness of the formation and work with the personnel reserve. Based on the analysis of the results of sociological research and the assessment of the practice of forming personnel reserves, the authors identify key problem areas in the formation and development of management potential in government bodies, emphasizing the direct connection and interdependence of the qualitative characteristics of management personnel and the parameters of sustainable socio-economic development. The article substantiates that the management of personnel reserves in the public sphere goes beyond the exclusively organizational context and is integrated into the macro-social context; it is a personnel meta-technology indicating the level of maturity and the nature of personnel policy in government bodies. Based on the analysis, the authors' vision of new conceptual approaches and principles for the development of personnel reserves in the public sphere in the context of the implementation of national priorities and strategic goals of sustainable socio-economic development based on the disclosure of managerial potential is substantiated.

AB Introduction. Turkey's search for a new regional and global role in a changing world order has increased Ankara's attention to the Global South, which was peripheral to its foreign policy priorities during the Cold War. Although Ankara's growing engagement and influence in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region has attracted increasing attention from the research community, Turkey's foreign policy in this region is still poorly understood. This article attempts to explore Turkey's policy in LAC during the first decades of the 21st century, placing it in the context of Turkey's increasing desire for "strategic autonomy." Methods. The author used a case study approach to analyze Turkey's policy in LAC. Results. After the Justice and Development Party came to power in Turkey in 2002, Turkey began a systematic effort to develop relations with LAC, expanding political, economic, and cultural ties with countries in the region. Since the July 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, Turkey's foreign policy has been increasingly guided by the desire for "strategic autonomy." Growing mistrust and conflicts in Turkey's relations with the U.S. and the EU have increased Ankara's interest in seeking alternative partnerships and building situational alliances. Although Ankara's growing ties with LAC countries (especially Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina) increase the autonomy of its foreign policy, Turkey remains critically dependent on the West, both economically and in terms of security.

LA English
DT Article
DE symbolic capital; P. Bourdieu; urban sociology; territorial identity;
   place branding
AB The article reveals the possibilities of applying P. Bourdieu's symbolic capital concept to the analysis of places and territory. The initial foundations of the concept are analyzed in the context of his double structuring theory of social reality. Objective characteristics and resources of the territory are classified as first- order structuring, and associated assessments and perceptions are classified as second- order structuring. Based on the proposition that the approaches of social agents vary depending on their inherent habitus, it is concluded that it is more productive to view symbolic capital not as a sum, but as a constellation of social meanings. The ability to control these meanings becomes one of the key factors in the struggle for power, with its outspoken spatial aspect. In the context of understanding symbolic capital as distinction, the influence of symbolization practices on territorial identity is growing. It is argued that the proposed approach allows to take a deeper look at such current problems of place branding as the spread of "empty" brands, lack of attention to the needs of the local population, and the growth of social inequality. Using the example of the Kaliningrad region, it is shown that Bourdieu's views on the essence of symbolic capital and the nature of symbolic power open up new opportunities for critical analysis of social problems associated with symbolization practices, and also allow explicating the hidden interests of political and economic actors in the field of territorial administration.

DE Civil War in Russia; Siberia; G.N. Potanin; Siberian regionalism;
   political narrative
AB The article examines the journalistic legacy of G.N. Potanin from the point of view of its impact on the formation and functioning of the cultural and linguistic landscape of Siberia. The authors set three main objectives. First, to identify the thematic repertoire of G.N. Potanin's journalism that developed in the pre-revolutionary period, within which images of Siberia as a special socio-cultural space were articulated. Secondly, to identify the nature and direction of the changes introduced by the era of wars and revolutions in the representation of socio-political issues in the region. Thirdly, to establish the factors that determined the stability of the regional narrative set by G.N. Potanin's journalism in various historical, political and cultural contexts. In the pre-revolutionary period, G.N. Potanin's journalism covered three related topics. The problems of asymmetry in relations between European Russia and Siberia. The range of issues of cultural development of the region with an emphasis on the rise of all levels of education and the formation of an intelligentsia living in the interests of the region. The diversity and specificity of the peoples and social groups inhabiting Siberia, difficulties in the relationship between the indigenous and the alien population. After the February Revolution of 1917, Potanin's thematic range remained the same, but his political involvement and involvement in discussions and direct solutions to issues related to the political structure of Siberia increased. He was concerned about the lack of political maturity among the region's population. Actualizing topical and long-term problems of the development of Siberia in the public field, G.N. Potanin built a sociocultural space in which these problems unfolded. An imaginary space was located on the border of the intersubjective common world and the world created by its author. At the same time, the construction took place on several levels: spatial (Siberia is a special territory, a part of a country with specific conditions and its own interests in various fields); ethnosocial (Siberia is a region with a special historically formed population, combining indigenous and alien elements, and possessing a unique set of features); temporal (the backward colonial past of the region is contrasted with the advanced technocratic future). Thus, in G.N. Potanin's journalism of 1917-1919 Siberia acted as an integral part of Russia; as a cross-border zone of economic, social, scientific and cultural contacts that contributed to its development and the sustainability of relations with neighboring countries; as well as a place of application of advanced scientific ideas and a field for scientific and cultural research and experiments carried by local scientists and educators.

AB The article is dedicated to the issues of political and ethnic history of Shamkhalate, revising the range of sources, shedding light on the history of this political entity, and the formation of its social institutions under the influence of the Golden Horde and the Crimean Khanate. Research Materials: New, previously unpublished Arabic-script sources from private and state manuscript collections in Daghestan. Results and Novelty of the Research: The authors delve into the socio-political evolution of Shamkhalate within the broader context of interconnected societies. This interdisciplinary framework yields novel perspectives on Shamkhalate's polytonymous nature, its structural underpinnings, historical genesis, and its intricate relations with entities such as the Golden Horde and its successors. Furthermore, the study sheds light on the complex ethnic dynamics inherent within Shamkhalate. Ultimately, the findings challenge the notion of Shamkhalate's development in isolation, highlighting its profound entanglement with the hegemonic influences of Genghisid states such as the Golden Horde, Hulaguid power, and the Crimean Khanate. Moreover, the study underscores the continuity of administrative traditions within Shamkhalate, echoing practices established following the collapse of the Golden Horde in the mid-15th century.

AB This paper studies the role the Organisation of African Unity played in the Chadian conflict (civil war and Libyan intervention) resolution process between 1979 and 1987. It focuses on the analysis of documents deriving from this organisation devoted to the matter in concern. Special attention is paid to the determining of the stages of OAU peacekeeping development and evolution in Chad, highlighting the differences among participant states in their approaches to conflict resolution and particular political forces involved in the conflict and partially reflecting the Cold War context. Emphasis is put on the matters of the extent to which the war in Chad was influenced by the global context of a standoff between the West and the Socialist blocs, the transformation of external actors' policies towards Chad during the conflict, and the impact these changes had on the success of the peace-making efforts. The events in focus are the first case of a peacekeeping operation mandated and fielded largely by Africa's key integration organisation as its track record significantly determined the further development of African peacekeeping efforts. Today this experience is crucial to the modern African Union and other relevant regional structures' peacekeeping operations. The paper relies on a complex of general historic methods related to the introduction, analysis, and structuring of new information deriving from archival sources found in the collections of the Organisation of African Unity. The author also refers to publications by Russian and foreign scholars specialising in this field, simultaneously offering alterations to the narratives they previously introduced concerning the interpretation of the Chadian conflict events based on the source analysis conducted in this article.

AB We investigate the impact of political stability, corruption, and future confidence on retirement savings using a fixed effects method and data on 36 countries over the period from 2000 to 2019. Our study complements works in precautionary savings theory. We find a negative relationship between political stability, confidence in future and the retirement savings rate. The retirement savings rate is found to be lower in countries with higher corruption. In countries with higher inflation, unemployment and low-income countries, we observed a stronger impact of political stability, corruption and confidence in the future on pension saving rates. We find that lower political stability amid social tensions and lower unemployment will contribute to the development of a long-term savings program. However, the growth of corruption and rising inflation will act as deterrents. In developing countries, which the World Bank considers Russia to be in terms of income, the increase in pension savings in case of decreasing political stability can be replaced by alternative types of savings - foreign currency, food etc. The effects will be intensified, firstly, by a decrease in public confidence in the authorities in the field of pension reforms and because of the earlier "freezing" of the funded part of the pension. Secondly, the growth of corruption will be a factor intensifying the negative effect. Thirdly under the shock events, the behavior of the population according to the theory of behavioral finance will deviate from the rational theory of preventive savings. Based on the results of our study, we are skeptical about the prospects of the long-term savings program introduced in January 2024.

AB It is for the first time that recommendations to a "practitioning monarch" in the framework of the classical Indian political science has been introduced into the contexts of comparative ethics in this paper, and it is Kamandaki's Nitisara (ca.7th C.A.D.), both scarcely studied and by no means insignificant, on which investigation is based. The catalogues of the virtues detected in the text provide us with direct correlates not only to the Platonic system of the cardinal virtues, but also to the Aristotelian differing between moral and intellectual virtues, and in both cases also some specific features (beginning with the priority of temperance in the Indian case and that of prudence in another one) are displayed. At the same time, the comparison of Kamandaki's and Machiavelly's pragmatic immorality leads one to conclusion that while the Italian practical philosopher considered the evil as something contradictory (however helpful in some cases) to the good, for "Indian Machiavelly" there is no contradiction between them at all, inasmuch as they are contained simply in different compartment of the eternal dharma, sanctifying both of them for the solution of a monarch's practical tasks.

AB The sphere of foreign tourism during the Cold War carried out important state tasks in the USSR to form a positive image of the Soviet state abroad. The article is based on a wide range of archival materials. The formation and professional development of guide-translators of the Karelian branch of "Intourist" in the second half of the 1960s - first half of the 1980s is considered in the context of the tasks of foreign inbound tourism. A broad program for the training of guide-interpreters was developed by the mid-1970s. It included seminars, lectures, practical exercises, self-training. The seasonal nature of the tourist flow in Karelia made it possible to concentrate the political and methodological work of guide-interpreters in the autumn-winter period. The predominance of Finnish foreign tourists required the inclusion of sections related to the features of servicing Finnish tourists. A special place in the training of guide-interpreters was occupied by the method of answering the "uncomfortable" questions of tourists from Finland. The study of the foreign press, classes in regional studies allowed the guide-interpreters to understand the peculiarities of the mentality, ideological attitudes and stereotypes of the behavior of foreign guests. This allowed them to conduct professional training of Finnish-language guide-translators to work in the "Intourist" system in other cities of the USSR. The wide theoretical knowledge and practical experience of the guide-interpreters of the Petrozavodsk branch of "Intourist" made them in demand in the political education of their colleagues. The low earnings of novice guide-translators, the reduction of their staff and the high workload of propaganda work in the conditions of demonstration and communication crises in the sphere of foreign tourism are characteristic of this period. However, the numerically small number of guide- interpreters of the "Intourist" branch in Karelia coped with the state tasks of serving foreign tourists until the early 1980s.

DT Article
DE party system; party model; comparative analysis; taxonomy; typology
AB The article characterizes the heuristic potential of modern typologies of party systems. Usually, when conducting comparative studies of political parties, quantitative typologies of party systems by Maurice Duverger, Jean Blondel and Giovanni Sartori are used. However, even their heuristic potential is only partially used. Therefore, the article draws attention to some features of these typologies. In particular, qualitative differences were noted between the two types of one-party systems described by Blondel - traditional and mobilization. Sartori's analysis of party systems in shifting policies is also noteworthy. As a result of this analysis, four new types of (quasi-) party systems were formulated: dominant authoritarian, dominant non-authoritarian, non-dominant, and atomized. In addition, recently, political scientists have developed a number of new typologies and introduced new categories. Thus, Russell Dalton deepens the idea of the differences between authoritarian and adversarial party systems distinguishing exclusive and inclusive among authoritarian systems, and consensus, conflict, and consociative among adversarial ones. The evolution of Alan Siaroff's typology is traced, which leads to a difference in party system and party model, as well as the emergence of new subtypes - one-party super-majority in a two-party system, dominance and dominance in a multi-party one. Grigorii Golosov, using a modified version of the Nagayama triangle, identifies polyvalent and bivalent systems with a dominant party, monovalent and polyvalent two-party systems, monovalent and bivalent multi-party systems. Finally, Immaculada Szmolka and Lucia G. del Moral conduct a comparative analysis of party systems based on four independent dimensions: competition, stability, the number of parties and the balance between them, polarization. Each measurement allows one to select from three to eight types of party systems, which creates a convenient set of characteristics. It is important to note that these typologies can be used to study party systems, both in stable and new volatile political systems.

AB The article deals with a new phenomenon for the legal science- the legal response to the consequences of human behavior in the virtual space. The subject of the research is the relations arising in the process of such response. The aim of the study is to analyze the legal response to the consequences of personal behavior in virtual space, including in the Russian Federation. The methodological basis of the study are logical and systematic methods of scientific knowledge, as well as methods of analysis and synthesis of legal phenomena Foreign and domestic experience of legal response to the consequences of human behavior in virtual space is studied. The peculiarities of legal response from the point of view of consequences for the person for malicious actions in virtual space, connected with leaving a digital footprint, are analyzed. Particular attention is paid to such characteristic of virtual space as the possibility of using its properties to implement the interest of the user, as well as consideration of virtual space through the prism of legal construction and digital sovereignty. It is stated that the legal construction, characterizing the essence of legal response to the consequences of behavior of an individual in the virtual space, should have the following meaning - "if there are harmful actions associated with the use of virtual space, it is necessary to provide a form of legal response, neutralizing such actions, otherwise the network functioning and use of electronic information resources will be accompanied by socially dangerous manifestations". At the same time the legal response to the relevant relations is considered through the prism of law enforcement results - conclusions are made about the peculiarities of such a response. Attention is focused on the peculiarities of legal response to the consequences of actions of an individual in virtual space in Russia and in China. It is noted that at the national level there is currently no universal model of legal response mechanism to the consequences of a person's actions in virtual space. It is concluded that this problem has a multidimensional nature, which is largely determined by the level of legal awareness of network users. Particular attention is paid to the need to use the potential of techniques and methods of special legal, social and psychological mechanism of law, which are considered to be an important factor in the development of law enforcement practice. The research shows that unlawful behavior in the virtual environment is closely related to various types of deviant behavior related to the use of Internet, which from the category of violating non-legal social norms (primarily, morality and ethics) turns into unlawful behavior, as it violates the requirements of law. Attention is drawn to the fact that at the national level there is currently no universal model of legal response to the consequences of human behavior in virtual space - each state goes its own way, the legal impact is often exposed to those relations which are recognized as the most important and relevant at the moment. Such a response, as a rule, is situational, often pursuing several goals (political, economic, ideological). Further study of the problem involves the need to develop a system of theoretical ideas about the forms of legal responsibility for the negative consequences of behavior in such a space.

AB The article problematizes the historical and cultural process of the formation of the Russian philosophical language as one of the key events in the history of Russian philosophical thought. The key examples of reflection on the course of the Russian philosophical terminology's development (related to the names of A.D. Kantemir, G.N. Teplov, A. Fryazinovsky, A.S. Pushkin, V.N. Karpov, A.I. Galich, S.S. Gogotsky, N.Ya. Grot, V.S. Solovyov) are briefly considered. The author proves that the study of this section of the history of Russian philosophy involves special attention to the institutional infrastructure that created the environment and methods of production, translation and reproduction of philosophical knowledge, accumulating, discarding and consolidating terminological innovations. He pays special attention to the journal "Questions of Philosophy and Psychology" and to the consideration of the intellectual platform posed by the chief editor of the journal N.Ya. Grot, that is, to the task of creating a national philosophical language, which are dealt with both in the context of the intellectual program of the project and in the general context of the history of the development of Russian philosophical terminology. The author reconstructs the nature of the collective research project "Questions of Philosophy and Psychology", as well as the key points of its program - solving the "problem of life" as the main goal of philosophy, searching for new foundations for metaphysics and ethics through a radical rethinking of the subject of metaphysics and the union of natural science and philosophical knowledge (through the union of philosophy and psychology). The author concludes that the history of the journal "Questions of Philosophy and Psychology" marks a new stage in the development of the Russian philosophical language, which represents the transformation of philosophy into a discursive public force, and philosophical utterance into a means of communicative influence on social and political reality.

AB The article presents a comparative analysis of the processes of incorporation and excorporation into the political elite of Lipetsk Oblast during the governorship of Igor Artamonov. The author's attention is focused on the specifics of the legitimation of the new political class of Lipetsk Oblast. In the author's opinion, the new political elite is significantly different from the elite that took shape during the 20-year term of the former governor of Lipetsk Oblast Oleg Korolev. The theoretical framework of the study is the casestudy method, which allows delving into the analysis of a specific case of elite construction in Lipetsk Oblast, summarizing the author's long-term observations of elite construction in the region. The comparative method makes it possible to identify common and specific features in the processes of legitimation of elites under Artamonov and Korolev. An analysis of the current composition of the political class in Lipetsk Oblast allows concluding that almost all key decisions are made specifically by the governor. Any political figure automatically falls into the shadow of Igor Artamonov. The political legitimation of the elites takes place with the direct participation of a new structure-supplier of elite personnel Sberbank. Using numerous examples, the author demonstrates what new mechanisms in the incorporation of elites are taking shape in Lipetsk Oblast. According to the author's observations, excorporation from the political elite in the case of Artamonov's rule, as well as under Korolev, does not mean political oblivion. The high-status retirees are instantly moved to new positions that give them access to resources.

DE higher pedagogical education; pedagogical institute; public education;

AB The history of training higher teaching staff in Siberia dates back to the October Revolution, but the prerequisites were laid at the beginning of the 20th century with the opening of a teacher's institute in the city of Tomsk (1902). Subsequently, pedagogical institutes were opened in Irkutsk (1909), Tobolsk (1913), Krasnoyarsk (1916), which, despite their "institute" status, were secondary specialized institutions. After the October Revolution and the arrival of the Bolsheviks, teaching institutes were first transformed into Institutes of Public Education (IPE), and then reduced due to socio-economic reasons (the ruin of the country after the First World War and the Civil War; political and economic isolation of the state). This led to the fact that in the 1920s the emphasis was more on pedagogical technical schools, colleges and short-term pedagogical courses, which could train specialists en masse to the detriment of their quality. The revival of higher pedagogical education occurred almost 10 years later, as the need for qualified personnel arose due to the beginning of industrialization. In 1932, the Krasnoyarsk Pedagogical Institute was opened, which continues to operate today. When writing the article, published and unpublished sources were used. Published sources include collections of documents directly related to the history of KSPI, as well as periodicals. Unpublished sources include various archival materials, and oral sources that were received directly from university staff are of great value. The purpose of this article is to study the features of training of higher teaching staff in the Krasnoyarsk Territory after the opening of the Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical Institute before its transformation into the Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University. Over 53 years of development, KSPI has undergone qualitative development from a regional pedagogical university to a large research and teaching center in Siberia. During the period under study, targeted work was carried out to create a system for training teaching staff (the number of students during the period under study increased 9 times). Separately, it is worth mentioning the creation of a special physics school on the basis of the KSPI under the leadership of L.V. Krinesky, which eventually became the Institute of Physics of the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences.

AB The focus of this article is N. S. Lebedev's dissertation (1943) entitled " V. G. Vasilevsky as a Byzantine Scholar" , which was carried out by the evacuated Leningrad branch of the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences in Tashkent. The author refers to the transcript of the meeting of the Academic Council, Lebedev's biographical materials kept for his thesis (RAS archive), and his publications. As early as the late 1930s, Lebedev had intended to write a thesis on Byzantium and the Mongols, but the inaccessibility of sources and literature during the Great Patriotic War changed these plans. In the end, a historiographical topic was chosen. Given the scarcity of such studies, a research programme had to be developed. Lebedev did not limit himself to outlining the main conclusions of the central figure of his thesis but sought to analyse the factors of Vasilievsky's formation as a scholar and the conditions of the emergence of Byzantine studies in Russia. He also assessed the merits and shortcomings of the pre-revolutionary scholar's work. The opponents who spoke at the debate, namely, V. I. Picheta, S. K. Bogoyavlensky and E. A. Kosminsky, emphasised the importance of the "political moment" of the defence of the thesis and the significance of Vasilievsky for national and world scholarship, paying less attention to the characteristics of Lebedev's work. The historian's conclusions indicate a desire to demonstrate the leadership of Vasilievsky and Russian scholarship in the study of Byzantine history. The research thus served an important ideological function, i. e. to demonstrate the achievements of Russian scholars. By updating the prerevolutionary legacy, the debate serves as a certain marker of the revival of Byzantine studies in Russia, which began in the late 1930s and entered their active phase in 1943.

DE social order; constitutive order; ethnomethodology; phenomenology
AB The article explicates phenomenological prerequisites for understanding the constitutive social order. The main premise of the work is that the theoretical basis of the constitutive social order, the understanding of which is proposed in Harold Garfinkel's ethnomethodology, can be analyzed from the positions of phenomenological philosophy. The aim of the article is to analyze the theoretical presuppositions and the way of knowing the constitutive social order. The optics of phenomenological philosophy are chosen for the analysis of presuppositions because it is the optics that Garfinkel addresses in his works not only directly, but also through the phenomenological sociology of Alfred Schutz. The main text of the article is divided into two semantic blocks. The first section attempts to define an understanding of phenomenology as phenomenological practice. This is necessary because Garfinkel himself regarded phenomenology as a model for working with current background expectations that constitute an actual-reproducible order. For reflection on the problem of phenomenological practice, we turn to Edmund Husserl, Lothar Eley, and Eugen Fink, taking into account the analytical works of contemporary researchers. As a result, we emphasize the main attributes of the so understood phenomenology. The second section offers an analysis of the basic philosophical premises of the constitutive social order, relying on the previously defined understanding of phenomenological philosophy. The structure of the subject of ethnomethodology proposed in Garfinkel's early works is analyzed, as well as the main epistemological limitations that determine the specificity of cognition in ethnomethodology. The problem of cognitive process, determined by the requirement of coherence of experience without reference to a privileged topicality, is singled out separately. Cognition in the proposed optics is based on the principle of contextual obviousness. The limitation of cognition of ethnomethodology and phenomenology oriented on the problem of givenness, caused by the closedness of phenomenal idealization, determines isomorphism in their practical implementation.

AB The scientific monograph of O.G. Lekarienko, Doctor of Historical Sciences, presents the results of the study of the main European policy directions of the L. Johnson administration aimed at updating transatlantic relations within the framework of the "Great Project" program of J. Kennedy. Based on a wide range of sources, the author analyzes the process of implementing the ideas of "interdependence" and "equal partnership" between the United States and the EEC. The value and significance of the factual material presented in the monograph and the conclusions drawn by the author for understanding the development process and the essence of the Western alliance are noted. A comprehensive analysis of US European policy during the presidency of L. Johnson allowed the author to draw some conclusions about a significant revision of the program of the "Great Project" and about a change in the attitude of the American administration towards European integration. Already in the first chapter, the author convincingly shows the unreality of some of the proposals of the "Great Project" of John F. Kennedy and explains the reasons for the refusal of the American side from the project of creating multilateral nuclear forces. A significant place in the monograph is devoted to the analysis of trade and economic contradictions between Atlantic partners. The policy of the United States to solve this difficult task is presented by the author through an analysis of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and a description of the process of organizing its implementation, as well as negotiations within the framework of the GATT, called the "Kennedy Round". A separate chapter of the monograph is devoted to the role of the French President Sh. de Gaulle in the development of European integration and opposition to the United States. The author pays special attention to the study of US policy in connection with France's withdrawal from the NATO military organization. The third chapter deals with the issue of completing negotiations within the framework of the Kennedy Round. The author emphasizes the importance of the economic and political consequences of these GATT negotiations. At the end of the book, the UK's second attempt to join the EEC is being considered, using the crisis of the "empty chair". The study is an example of an in-depth study of the European policy of the United States during the presidency of L. Johnson, the achievements of which the author formulated in conclusion. The author concludes that the main success of the government of L. Johnson was the completion of negotiations with the EEC in the GATT. This has reduced the degree of economic contradictions in relations between transatlantic partners, and the policy of the Johnson administration regarding European integration has not undergone drastic changes.

AB The basis for thinking about the current state of interaction between business and public authorities is the monograph "GR-management of business organizations in modern Russia. Complex analysis and applied technologies" (Degtyarev, A.A., & Teteryuk, A.S. (Ed.). Moscow: Prometej, 2024). The paper notes the consonance of the contents of the book with the trends in the development of the professional sphere of GR (Government Relations) in a modern society with a market economy. Methodologically, the book deals with the concept of interest groups in politics, when the interaction of business with public authorities is described in the system of political governance functionally-strategically (lobbyism), micro- tactically (lobbying) and technologically-procedurally (GR-management). The monograph includes ideas about conflictual interaction between business and the state and the orientation of GR management towards achieving company profitability and obtaining political rent. However, this interpretation of the axiology of business, as shown in the paper, is insufficient and contradicts the modern understanding of capitalism as "stakeholder" oriented and "inclusive", in which profit, although the goal of business, is subject to public values. Hence, it is not lobbying (unilateral influence on the public decision-making process), but corporate public policy (socially responsible and partner behavior of business) that constitutes the strategic orientation of GR-management. With such interaction between business and authorities, communication comes to the fore as a search for mutually agreed positions in public policy.

AB The 1960s-1980s - 1980s is an important period in the history of Soviet political studies - a time when the approaches and styles of thinking that form the basis of the methodology of post- Soviet studies were developed, a time of institutionalization of the Soviet political science tradition. What are the distinctive features of this tradition? First, it is the conspicuous fragmentation of the subject field of Soviet "political science": it was formed under the i nflu- ence of several disciplines. Secondly, it is the clear connection between science and the practice of public administration, expressed in the integration of academic institutions and universities into the system of intellectual support for public policy. Finally, it is the discursive formalization of the authorities' request for control, "manageability" of social and political relations, which took various conceptual forms. One of these forms was the concept of "scientific management of society" based o n systemic and cybernetic approaches, which had a significant impact on the formation of thinking about politics and management, about the possibilities of regulating socio-political processes. In more practical terms, the statement of these questions launched a number of studies, in which scientists tried to find sustainable bases and factors influencing decision-making and to propose a clear organization of information support of public policy. Later, this direction became one of the main directions in socio-political research. It was developed by groups of scientists coordinated by the Academy of Social Sciences under the CPSU Central Committee. The most notable among them was the figure of Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences Viktor Grigorievich Afanasyev (1922- 1994), who led the development of the concept of "scientific management of society". The proposed article is devoted to the intellectual history and content of this concept, which is detailed in the works of V.G. Afanasyev. The relevance of addressing this material is due to the potential of the concept of "scientific management of society", which in its time formed one of the ideological foundations of the Soviet statehood. The authors consider the development of the concept in the context of Soviet studies of politics and their adaptation to the demands of power.

DE Germany; Zeitenwende; foreign policy; German security policy;

AB This study examines German doctrinal documents issued under the government of Olaf Scholz in the context of the "Zeitenwende" (turning point) proclaimed in 2022. Key documents analyzed include the National Security Strategy, Guidelines for Feminist Foreign Policy, Strategy on China, and Defense Policy Guidelines. Of particular interest are the ongoing transformations in Germany's strategic culture, which are unprecedented in scope and aim to position the Federal Republic as a significant actor in military policy. In response to Russia's military intervention in Ukraine, Berlin has increasingly emphasized the military dimension of its policy, including arms deliveries to Kyiv-an action that marks a departure from the postwar principle of refraining from supplying weapons to conflict zones. The article explores how intra-German debates on military and political issues are reflected in these strategic documents. The participants in these debates can be broadly categorized into three groups: proponents of both the "Zeitenwende" and the government's associated policies; supporters of the "Zeitenwende" who dissent on the methods or tools of implementation; and opponents of the "Zeitenwende" in principle. Using qualitative content analysis, the study identifies contradictions within the documents and inconsistencies in the implementation of Berlin's declared objectives. Many formulations in the documents are characterized by ambiguity, allowing for future revisions or additions. Notably, the Green Party exerts significant influence over the content, promoting a bellicose rhetoric and advocating for an expanded understanding of security issues. The findings suggest that Germany's practical approach remains measured and cautious. However, the incorporation of the "Zeitenwende"principles into strategic documents ensures their longevity, making it unlikely that any future government coalition will disregard these foundational shifts in Germany's military and foreign policy.

The research investigates the hypothesis that the absence of an international legal framework for anti-Russian sanctions creates an increased need for the United States to legitimize them. The work uses critical discourse analysis (CDA) to investigate discursive strategies of legitimization of U.S. sanctions against Russia (through 1) emotions; 2) hypothetical future; 3) procedures; 4) expert opinion; 5) altruism). The study shows that anti-Russian sanctions is a part of the hegemonic foreign policy of the United States. It is manifested, reproduced, and justified through the official narrative. Political discourses containing ideological attitudes are used by the United States to create, maintain and protect its identity, which is based on the binary opposition "Self-Positive Representation - Other-Negative Representation" and has a projection on the country's foreign policy. The most convincing discursive strategies of legitimization are those that appeal to the fundamental pillars of American identity (strategies 1, 2, 5). Strategies that rely on more specific/ situational grounds and argumentation systems are the least convincing (strategies 3, 4).

AB The article's introduction includes the main prerequisites for internal political transformation's process in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The study's purpose is to identify new trends in the largest countries' domestic policies in the region in the third decade of the 21st century. The study's materials are used mainly by Spanish-speaking authors and Spanish-speaking news agencies who most closely and fully know the situations in LAC countries, the objective data from reports of the various UN structures, and independent Englishspeaking researchers invited to Latin American universities. The article's methodological basis was the scientific principle of objectivity, which it made possible from the available array of information to identify the main directions of transformation taking place in LAC countries in the study period. The systematic approach's application made it possible to identify the main events in LAC countries that characterize the multi-vector transformation trends. The article's author identified further perspectives for LAC countries development with the help of special historicalcomparative and historical-genetic methods. The study's results were the author's conclusions that the domestic policy of big Latin American countries in the third decade of the 21st century is characterized by a tendency of "catching up" development. There is a noted instability of the domestic political course in the political system of these Latin American countries (from a liberal to a conservative course and vice versa), and the economic models' frequent change does not give the desired result. The social problems are caused by the main population's poverty, especially the indigenous one, and these problems cannot be resolved due to transnational migration of the population and transnational crime (from drug trafficking to human trafficking and weapons). All this explains the diversity of the internal political transformation in Latin American countries.

DE religious imperatives of attitude towards non-believers in Christianity;
   Russian; Tatar; and Sart resettlement; spiritual and religious influence
   on Kyrgyz nomads
AB The article highlights the main factors that have shaped the unique religious situation in Turkestan. The specifics are attributed to the following circumstances: (1) The region has a "multi-ethnic" nature with an extremely high degree of ethnic diversity. (2) Despite Islam's undeniable dominance, the extent and practice of Islamic involvement varied among different ethnic groups. Traditional polytheistic beliefs, adat, and shamanism were prevalent among the nomadic peoples. (3) Three types of migrations simultaneous occurred: the relocation of Sarts, Tatars, and Russians. For the nomadic Kyrgyz population, the Sart migration was of great significance as it led to the development of agriculture, horticulture, and the establishment of permanent settlements in the steppe. (4) There spread various forms of "steppe missionary work" - the spiritual and religious influence of Sarts and Tatars on the nomadic Kyrgyz, a direct result of these migrations. (5) There existed a risk of inter-religious conflicts between Sunnis (and partly Shiites) and Armenians. Pre-revolutionary texts indicate that Russian policies in Turkestan were crafted with local peculiarities in mind, tending towards balance and moderation. By the time Central Asia was incorporated into the Russian Empire, the state had already accumulated experience in managing ethnically and religiously diverse territories. Another foundation was the mistakes made by Britain in East India. The overarching principle in early internal policies in Turkestan was gradualism and caution. Several consistent principles of internal, including religious, policy can be observed: (a) despite the region's gradualism and specific characteristics, administrative management was aligned with laws applied in the rest of the Russian Empire whenever possible; (b) Orthodox missionary activities were rejected among the traditionally Muslim peoples of Turkestan; (c) Christianity was preserved and spread among Russian military personnel and settlers; (d) the spread of Islam among Slavic peoples was simultaneously prohibited. The government based its actions on the idea of religious tolerance while fearing Muslim proselytism as a hindrance to increasing Russian influence in Turkestan.

AB In the personal fund R-2808 "Boris Sergeevich Abalikhin - Doctor of Historical Sciences, Professor" of the State Archive of the Volgograd Region (SAVR) the authors identified a personal letter from the academic secretary of the regional center of the Saratov State Pedagogical Institute, Associate Professor Pyotr Vasilievich Tkachenko to the rector of the Volgograd State Pedagogical University V. I. Danilchuk and Academician B. S. Abalikhin. S. Abalikhin, dated by postmark November 18, 1993. On the envelope on the diagonal large "V. I. personally" was diagonally written. It was received in Volgograd on November 21, 1993. The letter bears the rector's visa - "to Vice-Rector N. K. Sergeev, to Academician B. S. Abalikhin." Most likely, the letter was written after the regional meeting on vocational guidance work, at which V. I. Danilchuk spoke. The meeting with his colleague from Volgograd revitalized P. V. Tkachenko's Stalingrad memories associated with the Great Patriotic War. In his letter, the events of the Battle of Stalingrad and the battles for Orlovka come to life in his memory. Biographical information is drawn from the personal file of Associate Professor P. V. Tkachenko, kept in the archive of the N. G. Chernyshevsky Saratov National Research State University. It contains an autobiography, personal record sheet, certificate of school department of Krasnokutsk Pedagogical College, diploma of Saratov State Pedagogical Institute, diploma of candidate of sciences and certificate of associate professor, characteristics, list of scientific works, award list, certificates, statements, decision of the Ministry of Education of the RSFSR on awarding, excerpt from the order on declaring gratitude to the participants of the Battle of Stalingrad. The Book of Memory of the Saratov region contains information about the military service of P. V. Tkachenko. In 2023 Volgograd and the whole country celebrated a significant event, a landmark for the historic victory in the Great Patriotic War - the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi troops by Soviet troops in the Battle of Stalingrad. In the state plan of celebration, approved by the President of the Russian Federation V. V. Putin, special attention was paid to the activities associated with the personification of the great feats of the heroes of the Battle of Stalingrad. It seems that the introduction of this letter into scientific circulation will complete the picture of the Battle of Stalingrad through the prism of the memories of 79-year-old political officer of the 7th company of the 724th rifle regiment of the 315th Siberian rifle division Pyotr Vasilievich Tkachenko. The letter is autograph, has a handwritten form and is written on yellowed paper. The date of writing is missing.

AB The relevance of the work is due to the low level of historical analysis of the turn of the 20th - 21st centuries in domestic historiography, which especially applies to scientific and technical topics. In this regard, the digitalization of the fuel and energy complex (FEC) of Russia is of particular interest. Analysis of the causes and factors of this process reflects general trends characteristic of all sectors of the national economy. At the same time, the authors' attention to the digitalization of the fuel and energy complex is due to the high level of its impact on Russia's energy security. The content of the article is based on information from documents in federal and regional archives, as well as a wide list of literature, primarily scientific and technical. Research methods used: comparative method, historical-typological analysis, comparative-historical and problem-chronological. The authors identify four main groups of causes and factors of this impact: scientific and technological, political, economic and social. In our opinion, the scientific and technological factor was of primary importance in the digitalization of the Russian fuel and energy complex. The article differentiates the external and internal components of this factor. The authors emphasize that, despite the predominance of imports of digital technologies, as well as the strengthening of international cooperation, enterprises of the Russian fuel and energy complex have developed internal capabilities for creating and selling digital products. In this matter, a positive role was played by such trends as the expansion and strengthening of the role of the state and society, as well as new forms and methods of economic strategy and tactics of fuel and energy complex enterprises. Thanks to the success of this activity, enterprises of the fuel and energy complex have become the leaders in the digital transformation of the Russian economy. The final conclusion is that business, society and the state during the period under review laid the foundations for reducing dependence on external factors for the dynamic implementation of digital products. An obvious problem that hampered the growth of internal opportunities for the dissemination of digital technologies in the Russian fuel and energy complex was the lack of a large intersectoral scientific and technological center capable of generating and implementing advanced technologies.

AB Canada, despite its geographical location in North America, following its closest allies, mainly the USA, seeks to strengthen its influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The Canadian Government sees significant opportunities for the development of its economic, diplomatic and military potential. Canada's Indo-Pacific Strategy, announced in 2022, has become the doctrinal basis of this policy, systematizing it in three key areas - economic, military and humanitarian. The article examines the issue of the transformation of the terminology base used, the regional Strategy of Canada as a mid -ranking power in the Indo-Pacific region, the main directions of its policy, and analyzes its doctrinal design with regard to the presence of goals, objectives, risks and threats in the Strategy. The author also focuses on the "anti -Chinese" aspect of the Strategy as a combination of diplomatic, economic and military means of the Canadian "containment" policy toward the Communist Party of China, whose growing influence, according to the Canadian political circles and the expert community, carries risks for regional stability and security, for a regional order based on rules and regulations. The study shows that in the long term, the priorities of Canada's Strategy in the Indo-Pacific are updating the system of bilateral economic, diplomatic and defense agreements, as well as supporting the defense potential of partner countries. At the same time, despite the desire to strengthen its military presence in the region, the expansion of economic and trade development with regional actors will remain a key aspect of Canada's policy.

AB The article attempts to reconstruct the social and political ideas of Sergei Durylin, a Russian writer, philosopher and art historian (1886-1954), and explores his views on the essence of Russia and the Russian national consciousness. On the basis on Durylin's artistic, journalistic, and religious-philosophical writings the authors conclude that his worldview is deeply rooted in Orthodoxy and can be described as symbolic, figurative, intuitive one and based on a belief in the limited role of reason in understanding the world. According to Durylin, Russian national consciousness is determined by apocalypticism, paschalism, a special attention to the individual, and importance of the individual in realizing the indivisible connection with the whole. It also includes a perception of everything in the world as alive, including people, the Church, and Russia itself. The article highlights the primary importance of the internal over the external in the ideas of Durylin, its constant aspiration to the high ideal, humility and wisdom in accepting the imperfect earthly world, and 'silence' as the ideal of Christian community life. Durylin's worldview is a conservative one that emphasizes history, tradition, religion, preserving a unique (and therefore the true) identity within society and the state.

AB The article presents an analysis and comparison of three concepts of the future in the philosophy of artificial intelligence: dystopia, utopia and protopia. The author describes each of these concepts in detail, highlighting their key aspects, advantages and disadvantages. Artificial intelligence is considered in its weak version as a system designed to perform specific tasks and functions. As an example, the language model of OpenAI company - ChatGPT - is given, which is widely available and demonstrates a very high speed of development. The author considers five levels of technology development to achieve the level of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) - a strong version of artificial intelligence, which will be comparable in power to human intelligence or even surpass it. The current level of ChatGPT development is defined as the first one, but according to OpenAI employees, it can reach the second level in the foreseeable future. This indicates significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence and raises important questions about its future impact on society. Based on the analysis of the current level of AI development, as well as some facts and events taking place at present (such as legal regulation or user experience), the author attempts to determine the most probable concept of the future. Utopia and dystopia are assessed as extremely positive and negative scenarios, and therefore the least likely ones. The current state of things suggests that the concept of protopia, which includes features of the other two, is closest to reality. Protopia assumes that AI development should be aimed at the benefit of all humanity and be carried out under the control of society and the state. This will help avoid negative consequences and ensure sustainable development of society in the future. The author emphasizes that all three concepts are hypothetical, but they help us think about the possible consequences of developing artificial intelligence and take measures for its safe and effective use. The author concludes that only a balanced and responsible approach to the development and implementation of artificial intelligence can ensure its positive impact on society and prevent possible negative scenarios.

AB Introduction. There has been a rich tradition of using stereotypes and cliches of Russians in U.S. comic strips since the 1940s. Russian characters represent statehood, cultural dominants, and ethnic stereotypes. They convey the political agenda and civic values and demonstrate reactions to historical cataclysms. The leaders of the USSR represent the state as a political system in comic strips. In the 1980s, the interpretation of the "Russian threat" changed significantly, as did the methods of representing the General Secretary of the Soviet Union. Methods and materials. The article is based on the principles of historicism. The analysis was carried out using a set of methods: descriptive, elements of discourse analysis, and semiotic tools. The work used a range of sources, among which the most important were the issues of graphic comic strips regulating censorship documents and visual representations of Russians. Analysis. The author analyzed the dramaturgy of the 1986-1989 comic strips about the "Russian threat," in which Mikhail Gorbachev appears. The key motifs that made up the image were identified, an iconological analysis was performed, and the speech characteristics of the protagonists and antagonists of superheroics were analyzed. The dynamics of the image of the leader of the USSR in superhero comic strips were determined by the transition from a caricature image to a Machiavellian ruler of the "Evil Empire," ready, among other things, to collaborate with the United States. Results. From the point of view of iconography, a number of techniques for depicting Mikhail Gorbachev in comic strips correlate with the techniques of representation of Ronald Reagan. In some comic strips, the strategic superiority of the leader of the USSR over American superheroes is indirectly emphasized. The appearance of realistic features in the image of Gorbachev makes it possible to talk about the expansion of cultural ties between the USSR and the United States, a well-known social demand of the target audience, completely dissatisfied with the stereotypical images of the leaders of the USSR and the country itself.

AB Sources on the history of the Battle of Kulikovo have been studied in detail in Russian historiography. Much attention in the literature was paid to "The Tale of the Massacre of Mamaev." Soviet-era scientists made significant contributions to his research. However, in the works of the 50-80s. XX century, dedicated to this work, the worldview of the medieval author was sometimes interpreted in a modern political science key. Turning to the analysis of the content of the historical source, the authors identified "religious and moralizing maxims" in its structure, which were qualified as a "form of political thought", a manifestation of a political tendency. It was argued that the text expressed the "interests of the working masses" and served the cause of progress. D.S. Likhachev wrote about the need to study the worldview embodied in the source. A.M. Panchenko emphasized the influence of the "everyday" (worldview) layer, as the foundation that determined behavioral structures, moral prohibitions, on the event layer. The influence of the "everyday" layer on the "event" layer was also reflected in "The Tale of the Massacre of Mamayev," but this relationship was not studied. Let us consider, based on the Cyprian edition of the work, comparing it with other editions, religious epistemes that reveal the medieval understanding of the meaning of the battle, as the ideal motive of the participants in the Battle of Kulikovo, which influenced its outcome. The author of the Cyprian edition of the "Tale" narrated the battle in the context of the worldview and literary etiquette of his time: faith, sacred actions, moral assessments, ideas about what should be. According to his views, the preparation and course of the Battle of Kulikovo took place within the framework of the providential area and internally motivated human actions. The creator of the "Tale" emphasized the religious "mechanism" of preparation for battle and combined the spiritual mood of the warriors with real military operations. He connected the events of the current day with the facts of sacred history, interpreted them in the spirit of sacred reality, perceived and described the victory in the battle as a "miracle" that happened in an atmosphere of religious faith. The idea of the importance of faith as a value for which the battle was fought was carried out in all editions of the monument. This was evidenced by Dmitry Ivanovich's calls to the soldiers. This idea was professed by Metropolitan Cyprian. Religious symbols in the text of the "Tale" revealed the subjective logic of man, the meaning of personal moral responsibility on the path to victory. In life and in work, they performed the role of psychological and methodological attitudes appropriate to the time.

AB The article reconstructs the biography of the Omsk socio-political figure, journalist, editor, revolutionary, social-democrat A. N. Gladyshev. Despite the fact that he played a considerable role in the revolutionary movement in Siberia in 1905-1907, 1917, in the city life of Omsk in the inter-regilization period, a separate scientific publication about his biography, has not yet been written. This is largely due to the fact that he initially entered the menshevik fraction and negatively reacted to the arrival of the Bolsheviks to power in the fall of 1917. At the same time, his biography multiplictly reflects the features of the fate of the intellectual in the Russian province, which is not side to political events. The study revealed the role of A. N. Gladyshev in the formation of his nephew - the famous Soviet figure V. V. Kuibyshev. The basis for conducting the study was a set of unpublished sources identified by the author in the funds of the historical archive of the Omsk region, the Omsk State History and Local Lore, Media and memories of A. N. Gladyshev's activities in the memoirs of revolutionaries. The correspondence of the 1950s 1970s has the greatest information potential for this production. A. N. Gladysheva with an Omsk historian, candidate of historical sciences P. L. Trofimov. At the same time, the biography of Gladyshev requires further, more detailed reconstruction, since far from all documents, the numerous memories of A. N. Gladyshev were identified. In conclusion, the author comes to the conclusion about the importance of the documentary heritage of A. N. Gladyshev, as an active participant in historical processes in Siberia.

AB The publication is an analytical review of a collection of articles prepared by a group of historians under the auspices of the European University in St. Petersburg. The purpose of our work is to consider the book novelty as a phenomenon in the modern historiography of the Revolution and the Civil War in Russia from the theoretical standpoint of the principles of system and determinism. Due to the specifics of the topic, the main scientific method used by us in the review is problematic. The relevance of the views, the original approach and methodology of a wide range of sources used by the team of authors in the study of the problem are emphasized. The collection of articles makes it possible to expand the understanding of events and phenomena in the life of the Russian state and society in the era of social cataclysms of 1917-1922. At the same time, the past is interpreted, including through the discourse of the history of images, the history of emotions, anthropology, and the history of everyday life. At the same time, along with the merits of the publication, the final part of the review contains some subjective critical passages. They do not reduce the overall positive impression of the reviewed work and are seen as ways to further develop the topic (in particular, through an appeal to regional experience). In our opinion, the analyzed work, which is distinguished by rich factual material, can be useful to specialists in several areas of historical knowledge. This review is addressed to researchers of historical science, Russian historiography, the history of the Revolution and the Civil War in Russia.

AB The author of the article asks the question: is there a contradiction between the stated theme of the XXV World Philosophical Congress (Rome, 2024) "Philosophy beyond borders" and the principle of cosmopolitanism mentioned in the congress program documents? Indeed, in modern socio-political discourse, this principle is associated rather with the apology of globalism than with the recognition of the urgent need to promote and defend plurality of ideas, uniting ideas, traditions of the peoples from all the continents and regions. Considering the evolution of the concept of cosmopolitanism from antiquity to modernity, as well as the regional Soviet and post -Soviet history of its comprehension, the author comes to the conclusion that the identification of the concepts of "globalism" and "cosmopolitanism" comes from their superficial interpretation. A deeper look at the problem makes it possible to identify the essential difference between the phenomena denoted by these concepts, as well as positive and negative aspects in each of them. The author draws the opinions of leading modern foreign and domestic philosophers who answer the questions: what should be the philosophy of the future, a philosophy that has outgrown the restrictions once imposed by its Eurocentric definition; what role does philosophy play in solving global problems of our time. The role of cultural dialogue and intercultural philosophy in solving the problems of the modern world is emphasized.

DT Article

AB The article characterizes the process of universities' struggle for scientific leadership during the late Soviet period, in light of government approaches to the allocation of resources for the development of the research sphere. In the 1930s, the Soviet government gave universities their own unique identity, but priority in organizing and financing advanced scientific research was given to the Academy of Sciences and industrial research institutes. This imbalance continued throughout the Soviet period. Under these circumstances, universities faced asymmetric competition. They needed to find additional funding by following the dominant ideas of the Soviet establishment about the criteria for useful scientific research - one that gives quick results with a noticeable impact on the national economy. In this struggle, a few leaders emerged (no more than 10% of all universities), among which a number of old Russian universities, such as those in Moscow, Leningrad, Kazan, Tomsk, etc., occupied a prominent place. As a result, there was a bias towards applied developments, and little support was given to fundamental and especially humanities research. This was due to universities seeking their place in changing political and public context. This feature is characteristic of post-Soviet universities, which, after finding their niche in the Soviet apparatus empire, moved away from the canonical image of a classical university. This shift seems paradoxical, because often this image has pushed universities towards the path of struggle for scientific leadership.

AB In the world (but not yet in Russia specifically) there is already an extensive and rapidly growing amount of literature on the role and place of emotions both in international relations (IR) and in the foreign policy of states. This gives grounds to talk about the "emotional turn" within the framework of IR as a research discipline. But it is also well known that emotions are studied not only by IR, but in psychology, in various areas of neuroscience and in sociology as well. This article deals with some ontological and epistemological issues, arising from the results of multidirectional efforts of many academics to conceptualize the international political role of emotions on the basis of the leading international relations theories. The immediate goal is the exploration in the chosen subject area of the methodological problem of the integration of social science knowledge with achievements from the field of natural sciences. It is proposed to pay particularly close attention in this sense to the paradigm of affective neuroscience. The phenomenon of emotion, in principle, does not fit well with categories, which until now the IR has been focused on. Methodological imperatives of objective research push for the exclusion of subjective emotional experience from the scope of consideration. Constructivists, in their turn, treat emotion as a cognitive belief rather than as a bodily state. But in the article, the emotion is represented as a phenomenon which is both mental and physical. This is a monist view, going back to Spinoza. The research leads to the conclusion that, although social constructivism has good potential for studying the emotions in IR, when intentionally ignoring the biological nature of emotions, social constructivists can weaken their own position in comparison with those academic opponents, who are committed to instrumental rationalism in their approach. Constructivists thus limit with no good reason their own agenda when studying emotions and hinder the development of a transdisciplinary approach to the study of emotions in IR in particular.

AB Since the beginning of the 21st century, the number of empirical studies devoted to the analysis of factors influencing the risks of terrorist activity has grown significantly. At the same time, assessments of the influence of individual factors may differ in various studies, due to which there is a need for a generalizing work that will consider the key results of the studies. The last generalizing works were published in English in 2011. Since then, a large number of works have appeared that clarify the influence of various determinants of terrorism. This study presents an analysis of the results of quantitative studies of factors influencing terrorist activity. As part of the study, 75 papers published in 2011-2022 have been analyzed. The most widely studied determinants of terrorism can be divided into three groups: political, social and economic. A total of 53 factors were identified, the statistical significance of which was demonstrated in at least two studies. Studies of the factors of terrorist destabilization of the last ten years have yielded the following main results. They have shown that countries with a hybrid political regime (anocracy), in a state of internal or external conflict, with a weak central government (for example, "fragile" or "failed" states), with an intermediate level of socio-economic development (i.e. with intermediate levels of GDP per capita, urbanization and education) have the greatest risks of terrorist destabilization, although in recent years the zone of greatest risk of terrorist activity has shifted somewhat towards the socio-economically least developed countries. In addition, these states are characterized by low rates of economic growth, high inflation, large amounts of foreign financial aid, high levels of inequality, a fairly large population, pronounced discrimination against minorities, as well as high levels of repression and terrorist activity in previous years.

DE Plato; Athens; Atlantis; Critias; oligarchy; democracy; Sparta;

AB Debatable is the question as to into whose mouth the Atlantis legend of the Timaeus and Critias was put by Plato. According to the traditional opinion, Critias, who tells it, is identical with the noted late fifth-century B.C. oligarch Critias son of Callaeschrus (Plato's uncle), who was at the head of the repressive "Thirty tyrants" regime in Athens in 404-403 B.C. However, such an identification of Critias gives rise to very serious and insurmountable chronological difficulties. Some time ago, another Critias (son of Leaides), the "tyrant"' grandfather, became known from epigraphic data, and extremely likely is possibility that it is he who was depicted by Plato as a character of the Timaeus and Critias. This part of the article is devoted to the substantiation of this thesis. If it is correct, an entire family appears before us, in which extremely oligarchic position was hereditary. Such a situation is well agreed with the fact that another member of the family, Callaeschrus (father of the younger Critias and son of the elder one) was also an oligarchic politician.

AB Aristotle's Politics contains a non-traditional and even unexpected definition of oligarchy that pictures it, unlike the conventional interpretation (which proceeded from the transparent etymology of the term itself), not as the 'rule of the few' but as the 'rule of the wealthy'. Accordingly, one of the main signs of oligarchies for the philosopher is the property qualification. The article analyzes how the political practice of Athenian oligarchs correlated with these theoretical theses. It appears that the two stages of the oligarchic movement in Athens (late fifth century BC and late fourth century BC) substantially differ precisely in this regard. In the first case, the question of a qualification was not even raised, and an entirely different principle was applied: creation of a citizen body restricted in number (5000 in 411 BC, 3000 in 404 BC). As to the second case, they used the idea of qualification in its full sense (2000 drachmas in 322 BC, 1000 drachmas in 317 BC). So oligarchic regimes of the first period are closer to the traditional definition of oligarchy, whereas oligarchic regimes of the second period are closer to Aristotle's definition (and were undoubtedly created under ideological influence of the Peripatetic school).

AB One of the key features of the political and administrative development of the People's Republic of China is the appeal of the Chinese authorities to the resource of national political traditions. China's public administration traditions are an integral part of its administrative culture. This phenomenon is understood in the article as a mechanism for consolidating, transferring and recreating in new socio-political conditions the national experience of public administration based on the structural components of political culture norms, values and ideals of society reflected in the minds of public authorities, motivating their behavior and influencing the functioning of political institutions. The article defines two levels of administrative traditions - a complex of Legalist-Confucian ancient elements of political and cultural continuity and the revolutionary experience of administrative management in China in the second third of the 20th century. At the early stage of the transformation of the state administrative system (1982-1992), Chinese power traditions were actively functioning. The bureaucratic experience of imperial China began to be widely used. One of the key results of the early period was the strengthening of the power of the CPC. In the actions of the state, the influence of Chinese managerial traditions in economic activity and the rationalization of the administrative system was clearly traced. The authorities maintained the need for further political and administrative reforms. Therefore, Chinese administrative traditions were an effective way to transform the public administration system of the People's Republic of China. The policy of the authorities at the second stage of reforms (1992-2002) in relation to officials reproduced elements of the national system of the bureaucracy, which meant, in fact, the further functioning of the bureaucratic tradition of selection and training of senior personnel, preserved from the ancient complex of Confucian norms. The leaders of the CPC began to use the value potential of Chinese spiritual culture for the purpose of moral re-education of party cadres and civil servants of the People's Republic of China. The influence of national traditions on administrative development was reflected in the form of socio-political experience of significant content preserved in the historical past and fixed in the political consciousness of ordinary citizens and representatives of elites. The political system, thanks to the administrative reform of 1982-2002, relying on the resources of Chinese traditional culture, acquired the qualities of greater manageability and efficiency. Favorable conditions have developed for the further modernization of the state and economy of the People's Republic of China with the variability of the external and internal environment of the 21st century the volatility of the dynamics of economic growth, the threat of regional and global conflicts, pandemics and other challenges.

AB The strategy of socio-economic development of the region until 2030 calls the reduction of the population due to natural factors and migration outflow one of the main factors limiting the development of the region. To prevent the development of a negative situation, it is necessary to improve population's health, which is impossible without early detection of diseases and following all the doctor's recommendations, which is impossible without the population's positive attitude to the work of the healthcare system and medical workers. This work aims to study the population's satisfaction with the quality of solving problems in the field of healthcare and medical care provided as a predictor of citizens' commitment to treatment and an indicator of the sensitivity (responsiveness) of healthcare to the needs, wishes and requests of the population. Residents of the city of Cherepovets (n = 318) were interviewed. The questionnaire developed by E.A. Mordovsky, A.L. Sannikov, and K.B. Kornienko was used. The satisfaction of Cherepovets residents with the work of the healthcare system is higher (50.4%) than the all-Russian indicators (47.3%).

AB The literature on political trust currently continues to be dominated by the cognitive approach, whose adherents perceive trust as a function of political knowledge and social experience. In turn, the psycho-emotional foundations of political trust (personality traits, psychological needs and emotions) are still in the shadow of the cognitive revolution and remain poorly understood. The article attempts to justify the need to study political trust not only as a rational-evaluative construct, but also as a complex psycho-emotional phenomenon that arises at the intersection of cognitive and affective processes occurring at the conscious and subconscious levels. Having consistently analyzed three approaches to understanding the nature of political trust - as knowledge, as heuristics and as affect - the author elaborates his definition of this phenomenon, describing it as a specific psycho-emotional state that accumulates knowledge about objects of political space, emotionally and symbolically significant images of politicians and institutions formed in the process of socialization, as well as the confidence that the expectations arising on this basis will be met to one degree or another in the future. Moving from the conceptual to the empirical level, he examines survey and experimental strategies for distinguishing between cognitive and affective foundations of trust, revealing their possibilities and limitations. The final part of the article outlines potential further directions for research in the field of political trust. According to the author, agent-based modeling is extremely promising in this regard, as it allows looking at the cognitive and affective bases of political trust as a single whole, where cognitive and affective processes are closely interconnected and capable of moving from one state to another.

DE historical time; linearity; Eurocentrism; constructivism; multiple
   temporalities; time synchronization; haunting past; historical
   experience
AB The article analyzes the research literature on the topic of time, identifies key aspects of criticism of the existing research tradition, and attempts to identify constructive ways to study this problem. It is shown that the main pathos of criticism is aimed at versions of historical time, explicitly or implicitly associated with the ideas of homogeneous time, linearity, teleology, progressivism, Eurocentrism and ethnocentrism, as well as the interpretation of the position of the historian as a passive observer of the static past. As is usually written in the literature, time, especially the past, also was interpreted as an empty container that contained certain events and processes. From the position of the supporters of this approach, the function of the historian should be precisely to be the guardian of the boundaries separating the past from the present, and this historicization of the past should presuppose the need to establish such boundaries. Moreover, researchers such as Berber Bevernage and Chris Lorenz formulate a thesis about the "political nature" of temporal boundaries. Therefore, critical authors argue that researchers of historical time have paid little attention to the "performative" nature of temporal differences and that the establishment of modes of time (past-present-future) can be interpreted as a certain type of social action, conditioned by such definite social actors. It is argued that the past is dynamic, not static, and its boundaries are constantly being revised. The idea of blurring the boundaries between the present and the past (especially the recent one) has become very popular. Researchers note the persisting or repeating character of the past in the present. They talk about a resistant past, a past penetrating the present, a haunting past. As a result, many modern researchers insist that we should talk not so much about the acceleration of time in the modern era, but about fundamentally new approaches to time as such. They characterize the new understanding of time as "multilayered", "heterogeneous", "multitemporal" or "polychronic". Constructivism, based on the idea of the mediation of any social experience, was chosen as the methodological basis for the formulation of the theses put forward. The chosen concept of time (as well as historical time) is based on a phenomenological interpretation of time. It is based on the interpretation of time as a structure consisting of such modes as past-present-future, each of which represents a temporal extension consisting of such elements as beginning-middle-final. Then its completeness should be considered as the criterion for separating the past from the present. If we deal only with certain types of knowledge or representations, then it is reasonable to believe that what individuals or groups consider completed explicitly, and more often implicitly, by the very form of their practices, should be considered completed. In other words, certain objects, events or processes should be considered completed not in a chronological sense. If objects cease to be an explicit or implicit basis (motivation) for social practices, then they belong to the realm of the past. This approach assumes the possibility of coexistence and interweaving of multiple temporal streams, and therefore the need for their synchronization if some social practices come into conflict with other social practices. We believe that attitudes towards such diversity may be different.
   If it is possible to convince society (take responsibility) that certain processes or events continue to matter (for example, the issue of restoring justice for victims), then these objects will remain the domain of the present. If memory from certain events is limited to the area of local communities (memorial communities, for example) or reduced to forms of working through trauma (for example), then these objects can be attributed to the area of the past.

AB This study explores the political aspect of closed cities, which is understudied compared to their managerial and economic aspects. The author examines the association between the status of a closed city and political preferences in 1990s. The study suggests that closed cities were strongholds of both liberal and anti-communist voting. It also hypothesizes that the differences in political preferences between closed cities and the rest of Russia diminish over time. The author collects electoral data from 1995 to 2003 and employs regression analysis, finding support for these hypotheses. However, the effect of voting for the "party in power" varies depending on the specific party project. This research contributes to understanding the political uniqueness of closed cities, considering their regional characteristics and social capital.

AB Students often have questions about how new and advanced the field of political science is, how adequately a theory, concept, or idea describes or evaluates a political phenomenon. The subject of the author's research was the verification of the leading directions of political theory: the core of political science, closely related to political philosophy and methodology, which has a significant impact on the development of scientific research in industry areas and even on the periphery of the research field of political scientists. The purpose of the study is to systematize the parameters and criteria for bibliometric assessment of the leading trends in political theory. The author applied bibliometric assessment tools to data sets of three large bibliometric databases. They have shown relatively high efficiency, and the method itself is suitable for the verification procedure of leading areas of science. The theory of international relations, political economy, theory of democracy, and public policy and management from the point of view of bibliometrics are the leading directions of modern political theory. In turn, migration and demographic studies, as well as the theory of state and law appear to be bibliometrically undervalued. Prospects for continuing research are considered in two main aspects: expert assessment of sectoral policy research, as well as assessment of the intensity and effectiveness of application of the achievements of modern political theory in sectoral research.

AB The article examines the usage of the term "general on a white horse" in the political language of the Russian Revolution. Its meaning was influenced by Christian motifs, popular culture, ceremonies of the Tsarist era, and visual images of Napoleon Bonaparte. The image of the "general on a white horse" emerged in public speeches and the press afterthe revolution and became associated with authoritarianism, mass repression, and a possible return to the Tsarist era. Unlike the images of Napoleon prevalent in the press, the general on a white horse carried exclusively negative connotations. Revisiting this image during political crises, various political forces made it a symbol of a potential dictator's rise and the demise of democratic freedoms. The image was used to influence the government, unite political parties and society, as well as to accuse and immobilize opponents. Although different individuals such as A. F. Kerensky, L. G. Kornilov, and A. M. Kaledin were referred to asthe "general on a white horse" at differenttimes, the image represented a warning of a potential threat ratherthan a specific associated person. It is important to note that as early as 1917, a shorter form of the expression, "white general", began to be used by various actors. In this sense, it referred to the potential arrival of a dictator, and during the Russian Civil War, it became a common term for anti-Bolshevik figures such as L. G. Kornilov, A. I. Denikin, P. N. Wrangel, and others. The usage of the image of the general on a white horse / white general in 1917 became part of the cultural preparation for the Civil War. It came to embody absolute evil and existential threat.

DE Africa; Congo; Colonialism; Language Policy; Missionaries; Lingala
AB One of the urgent problems of African studies is related to the description of the language policy of the colonial authorities in Africa. The expansion of Portugal, France, Belgium, and England to the African continent had not only political and economic consequences, but also influenced the culture and languages of Africans. The article is devoted to the language policy of the colonial authorities of France and Belgium in the Congo, using the Lingala language as an example. Its implementation was conditioned by the complex ethnolinguistic situation in Central Africa. The origin of the Lingala language dates back to the second half of the 19th century, so the description and study of its history is closely related to the colonial period in Africa. The origin and development of the Lingala language is in many ways similar to the history of other new languages of the colonial era, but it is the most representative. The paper provides a detailed analysis of several hypotheses of the origin of this language. The article describes the language reforms carried out by Catholic and Protestant missionaries in relation to the Lingala language. The role of missionary organizations in Africa in the field of education and in the choice of the language of education and science is difficult and painful due to historical reasons and the peculiarities of the ethnolinguistic situation.

DE heroes of Vietnam; political culture of Vietnam; myth-making
AB The elevation by the state of certain historical characters to the rank of national heroes is always myth-making, which pursues its own goals. To understand such goals in relation to Vietnam, it seems important to consider its national heroes, especially since their list is actually determined at the state level.
   An analysis of the "official" national heroes of Vietnam allows us to draw a number of conclusions. The choice of characters is largely << Sino-centric >>, which generally reflects the role of the northern neighbor in the history of the Vietnamese state and its worldview in the modern period. Most of the heroes are military leaders and heads of state (mainly who went down in history because the resistance to the Chinese), and not cultural figures, science or art. At the same time, their official biographies are always close to the image of an ideal person, regardless of actual actions. Here one can see the Confucian basis of Vietnamese society, in which history is always positive. Noteworthy is the apparent lack of figures from the last two centuries (with the exception of Ho Chi Minh), which seems to reflect the following peculiarity of the political culture of Vietnam: power usually avoids personification. Also interesting is the modest number of characters associated with Buddhism and religion in general, which may be a consequence of the course taken in the last century to build socialism, which presupposes an atheistic view of the world.

DE reforms in 19th-century Russia, petitions, reform projects, serfdom
   question, Commission for Petitions, power and society
AB The established approaches to understanding the historical experience of reforms in nineteenth- century Russia emphasise the attention of researchers to identifying the political and socio- economic reasons that determined the need for reforms. At the same time, historians do not consider the feedback mechanisms of power institutions with their subjects, which allowed the government to assess the degree of necessity and possibility of reforms. One of the elements of such feedback in modern Russia were complaints, petitions and projects of Russian subjects. The analysis of their content and the process of their consideration makes it possible to reconstruct how the institutions of power reacted to such appeals and, most importantly, what factors determined the constructive nature of the dialogue between officials and petitioners. To solve this problem, the author analyses the content of collective appeals and records of the proceedings in the case of the proposal of the nobility of Dinaburg Uyezd to free serfs, as well as the petition of the noble assembly of Grodno Governorate on the organisation of local judicial proceedings, finance, and various aspects of interaction with the governor. The research identifies factors that facilitated constructive dialogue between the authors of collective petitions and representatives of higher government structures. In addition to the formal requirements for drafting petitions, it was necessary to clearly argue the need for change, using several key concepts that emphasised commitment to the publicly proclaimed course of restoring the rule of law and preventing acute social conflicts. It was found that a necessary condition for the establishment of a constructive dialogue was a high level of detail and practical orientation of the proposals, as well as their consistency with the expectations of the emperor. However, even when all these conditions were met, joint projects did not always come to fruition. The reason for this could be disagreements between those who presented the project, as well as in the circles of high-ranking officials. However, from a historical perspective, the options proposed by the Russian subjects for solving urgent socio- economic and administrative- legal problems created the basis for the development of principles and methods of reform throughout the nineteenth century

FX of Habsburgs in the relations with Moscow state was represented by
   Emperor Charles V and his brother Ferdinand I, Archduke of Austria (from
   1521/22) , King of Bohemia and Hungary (from 1526/27) , and Roman King
   (from 1531) . They were interested in forming a league of Christian
   rulers to counter Ottoman expansion, which meant the conclusion of an
   'eternal peace', or at least a truce, between the Russian state and the
   Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was united to the Kingdom of Poland by a
   personal union under the rule of Sigismund I the Old. The interests of
   Vasily III and his entourage were diametrically opposed: they wanted to
   ratify the Treaty of 1514, which was directed against the Jagiellonians
   and provided for joint offensives. From 1526, when the Hungarian king
   Lajos (Louis) II died at the Battle of Mohacs, Ferdinand I fought for
   the Hungarian throne with Janos Szapolyai, who was supported by Poland.
   At the same time, Charles V was preoccupied with the affairs of Western
   and Southern Europe. At the same time, he delegated the authority in
   maintaining international relations in Central and Eastern Europe to
   Ferdinand I. The Moscow- Habsburgs exchange of embassies showed that the
   Moscow side was reluctant to negotiate with Ferdinand I, despite his
   interest in it, sought to contact the emperor and did not disclose the
   anti-Jagiellonian content of the 1514 treaty, offering "renewed
   friendship and love". The fundamental divergence of the parties'
   objectives and the peculiarities of their communication meant that the
   Union Treaty was never ratified. The central place in the article is
   occupied by the analysis of the information about the Moscow embassy of
   1528, the fourth of five missions sent by Vasily III to the Habsburgs in
   the mentioned period. A new source on this embassy is published in the
   appendix with a translation into Russian: a letter from Ferdinand I,
   King of Bohemia, to Margaret of Austria, Governor of Flanders, dated 28
   July 1528, concerning the passage of the Moscow envoy to Emperor Charles
   V in Spain. Keywords : history of 16 th -century diplomacy, Vasil? III,

AB In 2016-2017, it was the Franco-German tandem which nurtured European security integration. The leaders of both states have been used to reaching a compromise despite different approaches to Atlanticism and Europeanism balance. However, the Ukrainian conflict escalation has changed the defense policies pursued by France and Germany. This paper argues, that during the last two years the differences between the two states concerning security issues have widened. With Germany even more relying on NATO as the most important security guarantor for Europe, France tends to simultaneously argue for a stronger, more independent European defense. Amid limited resources, it became more difficult for both parties to compromise. The article compares shifts in German and French policies on three levels, that are conceptual (the role of NATO and the EU in strategic papers and addresses of the French and German leaders), program-initiative (involvement in NATO and the EU security initiatives over the past two years), and military-industrial (joint projects and procurements). The research reveals that since the Ukrainian crisis escalation France and Germany have tended to rely on NATO as the main security guarantor, still the former is strongly committed to effectively strengthening European security. Germany and France differ in terms of their involvement in NATO and the EU security initiatives as well as procurements. Having its own nuclear weapons and military-industrial complex, the latter is less committed to NATO, yet highly supports European defense projects, seeking economic and political benefits. Germany prioritizes proven NATO structures, bilateral initiatives, as well as transatlantic defense procurements. The paper reveals a correlation between the policies of Germany and France and their dependence on the US military-industrial complex.

TI GREEN STICK? COERCIVE CAPACITY AND NON-POLITICAL PROTESTS IN RUSSIA:
   CASE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MOBILIZATION
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE environmental activism; collective actions; regional politics; social
   movements; political opportunities structure
AB Environmental activism is one of the important forms of civic activity in all types of political regimes. But under the conditions of autocracies it has a distinct specificity, which involves a conscious distancing from politics. The tendency to avoid "politicization" is an integral component of the strategy of eco-activists, who are well aware of the risks of protest actions in an authoritarian context. Environmental protest activity is often perceived as non-political by the ruling elites, but their reaction to it varies. In search of an answer to the question about the causes of such variations the authors elaborate a theoretical model, according to which the reaction of elites to environmental activism is determined by the power potential of the heads of executive government in combination with a high level of inequality, which signals the possible risks of eco-protests turning into broad political mobilization. The model is tested on data concerning environmental protests in Russian regions. By using the method of statistical modelling, the authors come to the conclusion, that the factor of socio-economic inequality does not affect the intensity of environmental mobilization, but has a key significance as a catalyst for the coercive reaction of the authorities. In the regions with high levels of inequality, the "stick" is systematically applied to environmentalists, while in regions with relatively moderate economic stratification environmental protests remain an acceptable form of expressing discontent. At the same time, the presence of a coercive component in the political capital of regional elites plays a crucial role in reducing the eco-protest potential. In addition to that, the research indicates that regional protest activity on environmental issues in Russia is leaving the format of non-political mobilization. As a result, the authorities' response is increasingly based on suppression, similar to other types of protests, which potentially limits the opportunities for conveying an environmental agenda.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of a monograph written by Claude Gauvard, professor emeritus at the Pantheon-I-Sorbonne University, a former student of Bernard Guenee and a recognized specialist in political history and the history of medieval law of the Western Europe. In her new work the researcher turned to the history of Joan of Arc, and despite the fact that in the last two decades the etudes johanniques have been experiencing a genuine flourishing and it is already difficult to fi nd a plot that would not receive coverage in historiography, Claude Gauvard chose a very special angle for this topic. The author of the article examines in detail the formulation of the problem proposed in the monograph - to study the history of the national French heroine from the point of view of the legal ideas of Europeans of the late Middle Ages; to show exactly which topics formed the basis of the reputation of Joan of Arc and of her subsequent perception by contemporaries; to reveal the purely legal aspects of the Maid's relations with her supporters and opponents, and above all, of the assessment of her activities during the indictment process of 1431 and the rehabilitation process of 1455-1456.

AB This is the second text within the all-Russian research on the image of the future in the mass consciousness using the methods of empirical sociology. In 2021-2024, researchers conducted 67 focus groups in 25 regions from Moscow to Kamchatka. In addition to diverse geography, the authors consider all types of localities as a research space: from supercities to small towns and villages. Two key methods are used: focus groups and psychography. Images of Russia in the present and in the future are described not only using words, but also presented in pictures by respondents. This text focuses on the study of mass consciousness of young people (age 18-30) and more local trends in geographical, generational, political and economic senses. The text highlights eight key trends in the mass consciousness of young people: socialization within Western culture, the highest level of paternalism (including the desired restoration of certain Soviet practices), weakening frustration due to cancel culture regarding Russia and its citizens from the West, demonstrative public depoliticization, permanent desire for a peaceful future with Russia's leading role in the international arena, etc. Despite the uneven attitude towards state institutions, the Fatherland is perceived by the mass consciousness of young people as a place to apply their own efforts to build a career and solve problems. The results of the study demonstrate the highest margin of safety of the Russian state, which has no alternatives regarding the construction of the image of the future.

AB The article discusses the formats of interaction between various participants involved in innovative and project activities in the educational sphere. We present the interpretation, adoption and adaptation of the concept of innovative ecosystem complementarity into the educational context. The article puts a strong emphasis on specific deficits and gaps that educational innovators face in their projects, and on emerging opportunities to overcome these gaps through the complementarity of resources and competencies of different participants in the innovation process. The empirical study is based on data obtained from semi-structured interviews with representatives of the regional educational system, teachers and administrators in schools, regional authorities in the educational sphere, individual innovators (authors of commercial and non-commercial educational initiatives). The interviews covered the following topics: the history of an educational project launch; platforms for financial, expert, and information support; partnerships, mutual exchange and dissemination of innovative ideas in the educational community. This frame allowed us to explore comprehensively the interdependence of barriers and drivers of an educational project, on the one hand, and support and collaboration strategies, on the other. As a result of two-stage thematic coding, we structured the main types of resource and organizational barriers in the innovation sphere, and identified the strong impact of personnel shortages and positioning deficits on the further growth and strengthening of educational initiatives in the community. To address these shortcomings, innovators get engaged in partnerships and collaborative alliances that might allow for sharing and concentration of resources, co-branding and co-joint launch of complex projects. Another result is the detailed structure of formats of institutional partnerships and horizontal interactions in educational projects. Thus, we identified leadership and associative forms of partnerships, regular (joint project activities and expert support) and event formats of interactions. In the discussion part, the article introduces the model of complementarity in education and reveals the dual character of horizontal educational partnerships. They give a significant impetus to innovative projects development and simultaneously cause institutional tensions in the organizational and managerial structure. The article provides the foundation for future studies on the overall effects of partnerships and specialised complementarities on the heterogeneity, diversity and quality of educational initiatives, and on joint development of human capital in education.

AB The article examines the process of institutionalization of political education and political sciences in Russia in the first quarter of the 18th century. This process finished with the creation of the Academy of Sciences and the Academic University. The first acquaintance with political education took place in the Slavic-Greek-Latin Academy and the Gymnasium of the Posolsky Prikaz (The Chancellery of Foreign Affairs). During the collegial reform, some projects to introduce political and legal education appeared. These projects were not implemented, but they determined the nature of political education at the Academic University, which responded to 1) the educational program by Peter the Great, oriented, among other things, towards the formation of a new bureaucracy, 2) the tasks of strengthening the court society, and 3) the ideas of political and theological synthesis. As a result of long search for a professor of politics for the Academy of Sciences, H.F. Gross took the chair of professor of morals and politics (moral philosophy) and announced in 1725 a course in ethics " according to Pufendorf's book On the Duty of Man and Citizen." . " Thus, the works by S. von Pufendorf became the main textbook on political science in that period. The guidelines set by the Academic University determined the trajectory of development of political education in Russia for a long time.

AB The article is dedicated to conceptualising the model of a "nuclearisation ladder" aimed at structuring the understanding of threshold nuclear states' behaviour. The scheme is based on the idea of the "escalation ladder", originally suggested by Herman Kahn in the 1960s and developed by a number of authors since then. Notions such as "guarantor" and "beneficiary" are introduced: they describe the relationship between the state that initiates the extended nuclear deterrence system and its allies that capitalise on the positive security guarantees. Among the steps of the "nuclearisation ladder" are guarantor's verbal interventions, legal confirmation of the positive security guarantees, emergence of additional mechanisms pertaining to extended nuclear deterrence, deployment of guarantor's nuclear weapons on the beneficiary's territory, and active development of beneficiary's own nuclear weapons. Lastly, a nuclear test symbolises the transfer of a threshold nuclear state to the category of de facto nuclear weapons possessors. Of note is the bidirectional nature of the "nuclearisation ladder". The external track is defined by differing levels of security guarantees on the part of a more powerful ally. At the same time, the internal vector is plotted based on the degree of proximity to obtaining an indigenous nuclear weapon. The author analyses both the cases of gradual militarisation of nuclear programmes and noticeably less conspicuous examples of de-escalation. From a rhetorical standpoint, the movement up and down the ladder is characterised by a transition from discursive practices to performative ones, exemplified by preventive speech acts. The policies of threshold actors in the Asia-Pacific (Republic of Korea, Japan, Australia, and Taiwan) serve as empiric material for validating the study. The position of each nation on the "nuclearisation ladder" is determined as of recent decades with respect to the concept of a "nuclear umbrella" provided by a nuclear weapons state, as well as considering national nuclear programmes.

AB The article presents some thoughts about the reasons for the current extreme concern of the Russian professional sociological community about the model of training proposed by the Federal State Educational Standard of the fourth generation. In the first part of the article, the author briefly summarizes general problems of higher education, which are typical not only for the Russian university system but also, to one degree or another, for most national approaches to professional training (massification, commercialization, bureaucratization, digitalization, loss of university autonomy and institutional independence for the sake of social- economic reproduction, a decrease in the quality of training of future specialists and in the authority of the university teacher, etc.). In the second, main part of the article, the author refers to the respected sociological works and expert assessments to identify main reasons for the professional sociological community's concern about the proposed radical change in the model of sociological training. Certainly, there is a number of obvious risks with "qualitative" variability, such as the priority of the political- science orientation, reduction in the volume of disciplines fundamentally important for sociological training, difficulty in mastering special professional competencies in a shorter period, unclear prospects for the full - time teaching staff of sociological departments, etc. However, the main danger is that the proposed model of sociological training would be unable to develop the main professional skill of the competent researcher (and not the demoscopist/practitioner) - sociological imagination, which requires longterm "slow reading" and constant methodological reflection.

AB Rather important goal for international relations is to improve methods for studying of interstate dialogue. The author pays attention to the format of intergovernmental consultations. The goal of article is to explore the functioning of the format on the example of Germany, which uses this one in the dialogue with 12 other states. The problems of the functioning of the format are still not in the details explored in Russian political science. Usually, the format is established by one power for the cooperation with another power or the very important ally among small and medium-sized states. The frequency of the meetings is established for each format. Compliance with frequency or violation of it, especially interruption of the work are the indicators of the dialogue development. One meeting in the format lasts only one day and it determines the scheme of the negotiations. The countries should focus on the most perspective and, on the contrary, the most problematic tracks of the agenda of bilateral relations, even if these negotiation priorities differ from the conceptual guidelines for each state. The key variants of the end of the meeting in the format are presented. The article explores the geography and chronology of establishment of the formats with German participation. Before the XXI century there was the long period of time between the launch of every two new formats. In the early - mid 2010s and early 2020s there were the waves of newly established formats. The author stresses the absence of the ones between Germany and the Arabian states, Iran, the African ones and explains the reasons. The difficulty for Germany was also the creation of formats with the Anglo-Saxon states. Another problem has become since the mid 2010-s the "freezing" of some formats (with Russia), the long interruption of their functioning (with Brazil, Italy, Poland, Turkey), the violation of frequency (with France, Netherlands, Spain). The article shows the reasons of such situations in each case. At the same time there has been stable functioning of the mechanisms with India and China, even when the confrontation between the PRC and the USA has begun. The author concludes that in the 2010s Germany has tried to make the system of the formats of intergovernmental consultations global. But by the beginning of the 2020s these efforts were unsuccessful and there was the degradation of the process.

AB The political crisis in France in 1356-1358, referred in historiography as the "Etienne Marcel revolt", has been thoroughly studied; all sources have been published, new ones are unlikely to appear. Estimations of these events have changed over the centuries, in the context of current methodological and ideological trends. Renewal of the political history allows us to take a new look at this traditional subject. The article attempts to understand the essence of the events that took place, and their consequences. The political crisis that broke out in France was a repercussion of the formation of a political society, and the activity of the estates. The general background of discontent with chivalry, and the ambitions of the strengthened urban estate determined the vector of demands on the power of deputies of the General Estates. Nobles, the emerging bureaucracy, and university masters played an important role in the development of reform programs. As a result, of overcoming the crisis, each social group has achieved its goals, albeit in a slightly modifi ed form. Thanks to the new system of apanages, the members of the royal family received a higher status and authority, turning into a cohesive team of the monarch. The hereditary principle of succession to the throne was formalized in a decree of 1374. The competitive selection for all positions was established in the royal administration, which laid the foundations for the irremovability of offi cials, and meritocracy. University intellectuals gained a place at the throne of the monarch, competing with lawyers, and continued to defend the importance of dialogue between government and society. The townspeople, led by Parisians, and peasants, have achieved recognition of their importance in the life of the country. Only the institute of the General Estates was discredited for a long time. The government still consulted with society, but in other forms.

DE Russian intellectual history; liberal philosophy; religious philosophy
AB Th e paper characterizes the contribution made by Pavel Novgorodtsev, the Russian philosopher of law, to the establishment of the moral and ethical tradition of law, which, in turn, is the philosophical foundation of the doctrine of new liberalism and human rights. Th is tradition was influential both in late-imperial Russia and in Europe, to which Novgorodtsev immigrated in 1920 and where he founded the Institute (Faculty) of Law at Charles University (Prague, Czech Republic). The authors consider Novgorodtsev's legal philosophy as an integral ethical doctrine, taking into account its development in the last period of the scholar's life. For the fi rst time in academic literature, it is argued that Novgorodtsev's views should be interpreted in the context of both the liberal and religious philosophical approaches to the understanding of law, and that these approaches complement each other and have played a significant role in the history of political and legal thought both in Russia and in 20 th-century Europe. Novgorodtsev's contribution to intellectual thought in Russia and Europe was in his thoroughgoing criticism of social utopias, particularly, Bolshevism and Communism, which were characterized by their denial of law and legal tradition. The research is based on a wide range of sources, including P. Novgorodtsev's papers and personal documents, in particular, his correspondence.

AB The political processes in Russia during the 1990s significantly enhanced the role of governors and republican presidents in decision-making at both federal and subnational levels. This article explores the factors underlying the establishment and evolution of the presidential office through the case study of Kabardino-Balkaria. An analysis of sources reveals a dynamic hierarchy of factors, including relationships with the federal center, consensus among local elites, and the degree of electoral legitimacy. The creation of the presidency emerged as a rational choice for the ruling group, whose members sought an arbiter figure to resolve inter-elite disputes and legitimize the existing regime. In Kabardino-Balkaria, a late Soviet governance system was reproduced, possessing sufficient potential for further personalization of political management. Within the formal system of separation of powers, the president wielded numerous mechanisms to influence the legislative assembly and delegated responsibility for implementing the political agenda to the republic's government.

DT Article
DE social trust; political trust; social capital; political regime; social

ID POLITICAL TRUST; GROWTH
AB The article analyzes the factors of generalized social trust in the modern states. The authors rely on the "up bottom" approach, which as- sumes that trust in political institutions has a significant impact on social trust, while also accounting for socio-economic factors. The research study of the modern European states that employed regression analysis of the sociological data from the World Values Survey and Eurobarometer shows that political trust continues to have a positive effect on the level of social trust. However, economic development and low levels of social stratification are equally important. A potentially important new factor is the increase in trust in urban communities, while the presence or absence of the communist past has lost its influence on social trust. The authors examine the case of Russia separately due to the specifics of political trust in personalist presidential regimes, Russia's longer exposure to communism, as well as the modern increase in the level of political trust, which radically exceeds the level of social trust. Based on the comparative study of sociological trends and factors of social trust in the country, they document the gradual development of a situation where social trust is inversely correlated with political trust. They tend to explain this phenomenon by the exaggerated importance of the personal and public security agenda, which negatively affects social trust, while simultaneously increases the demand for political trust. Socio-economic factors in Russia play a limited role, but can resume their influence during periods of reduced social tensions. According to the authors' conclusion, given the current political system, the potential for increase in social trust in the Russian Federation is limited.

ID SOCIAL MOVEMENT COALITIONS; URBAN
AB Cooperation between public authorities and activists is a well -studied issue in social movement research. However, the authorities are often considered monolithic and analyzed as targets of activists' actions a ff ecting urban con fl ict outcomes. Meanwhile, various representatives of public authorities demonstrate their own interests in urban disputes and di ff erent levels of engagement in resolving con fl icts. An evaluation of the database concerning dynamics of urban con fl icts in Russian million cities shows rare attempts to resolve con fl icts by core executives, such as mayors, governors, and deputy governors, compared to city and regional council members. Based on the sociological tradition of studying social movement coalitions (Van Dyke; Diani; Sterns and Almeida; Jasper and Duyvendak) this article examines the reasons why core executives make the decision to support activists in urban con fl icts in the context of a noncompetitive regime. The research is based on 97 semi -structured interviews with participants in urban and ecological con fl icts as well as experts in fi ve Russian million cities (Moscow, Saint -Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Nizhniy Novgorod, Kazan). Cases of core executives' engagement are explored as examples of state actor -social movement coalitions where o ffi cials provide their organizational resources and leverage to contribute to social movement goals. We identify six reasons why core executives make the decision to support activists in urban con fl icts: 1 ) public resonance created by urban activists around a symbolically signi fi cant object; 2 ) changes in economic and political structural conditions; 3 ) the potential risk of sanctions from or direct interference by federal o ffi cials; 4 ) the proximity of elections and the need to maintain public reputation; 5 ) the exploitation of urban con fl icts in order to win in intra-elite competition; 6 ) the emotions of core executives allowing them to align themselves with urban activists.

AB Pentecostalism is one of the fastest growing branches of Christianity in the world. In some regions it claims to be a significant player in political and public life. The number of Pentecostals is growing steadily in the countries of South America, Asia, and Africa. Studying the role of the Pentecostal mobilization potential in the protest movements can give deeper understanding of what is going on in these macro-regions as they play a significant role in the processes of global destabilization. The paper presents an analysis of the features of the ENDSARS protest movement, which took place in Nigeria in the fall of 2020. This series of protests was accompanied by a noticeable media campaign and had a pronounced religious character of the call and forms of protest actions. Young people were invited to participate in protest prayer meetings and processions. The protest actions that obstructed or blocked traffic were carried out on highways and objects of road infrastructure. Despite the participation of representatives of different religions, the movement was influenced by the religious rhetoric and practice of Pentecostals. An overview of politicization of religion and the spread of Pentecostalism in Nigeria, and the results of a multimodal analysis of digital videos associated with the ENDSARS movement are presented. The emphasis of the study was placed on the media content created by organizations and private users on social networks, video hosting services and blogs. The article provides a detailed overview of several typical examples of disseminated media messages, as well as an analysis of the religious leaders' official statements and video messages. The presented analysis shows that the influence of Pentecostalism can spread beyond the confines of the religious community and become an actualizing and mobilizing factor for the general population, including followers of other religious movements.

AB The landscape of media consumption has changed dramatically over the past few years. Social networks have begun to play a significant role in the dissemination of information, where huge volumes of false and unreliable data are generated. In turn, the latter can have a negative impact on the public sphere, since they have a high manipulative potential. In this regard, it seems important to understand how susceptible our fellow citizens are to the destructive influence of fakes and are ready, albeit unintentionally, to spread them in their immediate circle among friends and relatives. Also of particular interest are demographic and situational predictors that may contribute to these types of practices. In this article, based on materials from a quantitative study conducted in April-May 2023 among 1,000 residents of the Republic of Mordovia, surveyed using a representative quota sample, I focus on people's trust and dissemination of information, which later turned out to be unreliable and fake. As the results of the study show, three out of ten respondents are inclined to trust unverified information, another two are inclined to share it with their immediate circle. The data obtained, in my opinion, significantly actualizes the problem of fakes, since, apparently, we can talk about the minimum thresholds that have been found. In reality, the scale of their penetration may be noticeably higher. The key predictors of trust in unverified information and its subsequent dissemination in one's immediate environment are, apparently, situational factors - I identified a relationship with the noticeable level of disagreement with the dynamics of the state of affairs in our country and an increased level of disagreement and disunity in the environment of respondents. Dependencies with demographic factors are lower, although age and education can be distinguished among them: younger people are more likely to believe in fakes and share them, and more educated people are less likely to do so. The results obtained are partially verified by studies of Western colleagues, although they are not without a number of controversial issues. Nevertheless, it seems clear that fakes pose a significant threat to deliberative politics, which centers public discourse. It is important to note that, apparently, I was able to find an interesting national feature: "angry" citizens who are not in opposition to the government, but, apparently, are ready to join it, and who do not receive significant support from their environment.

ID PRIVACY PARADOX; BIG DATA
AB The problem of collecting personal data has long been and remains on the periphery of interest on the part of Russians, being in the second echelon of topics of public discourse that are important to them. Citizens traditionally rely not on themselves, but on government agencies in this matter, with little or no reflection on how protected they actually are from potential risks. Privacy in our world is becoming illusory; any action on the Internet a priori implies a citizen's refusal to have reasonable expectations for the safety of posted data. Various companies often use this for different purposes, including interference in socio-political processes. In this article, based on materials from a quantitative study conducted in April-May 2023 among 1,000 residents of the Republic of Mordovia, surveyed using a representative quota sample, we examine their attitude towards the practices of collecting personal data from companies. The results of the study show that every second respondent does not know that companies collect personal data about users on social networks and can subsequently use it to their advantage. Such practices are subject to severe obstruction: the vast majority experience expressed negative emotions in relation to them, such as hostility, irritation, fear, disgust, and hatred. The consequence of this is a low level of trust in these types of companies. It was revealed that, with a high degree of probability, the main predictor of awareness of the practices of collecting personal data is the type of place of residence - the indicator increases noticeably in the regional capital and decreases beyond its borders. Another parameter that could potentially have an impact is the level of education; as a rule, greater awareness is recorded among people who have ever studied at a university. The problem of perceptions of personal data collection may have significant implications for social theory as a whole. Even classic works in the field of sociology postulate that, as soon as individuals become aware of excessive control from others, they are forced to change their behavior, and sometimes this becomes the cause of a number of destructive phenomena (for example, increased suicide rates). Managing privacy regimes is becoming an important idea, but it must be of a conscious nature to individuals; they must take a responsible approach to signing user agreements and building behavioral boundaries on the Internet and social networks.

   knackers; University of Paris; constructing memory; the effect of
   non-occurrence; defamiliarization
AB The uprising that took place in Paris in 1413 and traditionally referred to as the Cabochiens' revolt has long been the subject of monographic research. Its story is presented only in the context of large narratives about the civil wars of the Bourguignons and Armagnacs, that is quite justified, but does not imply an increase in scientific knowledge. Moreover, all available sources have been studied well already. In this article, it is proposed to approach this event using the so-called "out-of-the-way effect", which Mikhail Bakhtin wrote about and which Aron Gurevich liked to recall. In this case, the events in Paris in 1413 may be associated with much larger processes, which were previously defined as the "crisis of feudalism", which formerly caused considerable controversy. One of the manifestations of this crisis was considered as "bastard feudalism", though this term was although disputed in historiography. The formation of a modern state (& Eacute;tat moderne) was an equally debated process. It is also important to include the Cabochiens' revolt in the series of urban movements of the second half of the 14th - 15th centuries. Such a combination does not interfere, but rather helps to identify the specifics of the events of 1413, which firmly occupied a place in the chain of Parisian "revolutions" that stretched for six centuries or even more. In 1413, several processes temporarily merged in Paris, each of which had its own logic and its own history. These are the political activity of the University of Paris, and the movement for the reform of the Church and the kingdom, and the logic of the struggle of feudal rulers, and the evolution of the image of royal power, and the balance of forces within the Paris municipality, and the traditions of urban riots, and much more. In addition to the effect of "non-occurrence", the technique of defamiliarisation, developed at the beginning of the last century by Victor Shklovsky, a Russian formalist philologist, may also be useful. It allows you to look at a familiar thing from an unexpected side, breaking stereotypes of perception. Regarding the Cabochiens, this allows us to draw attention to how immediately after the uprising work began to remove all references to the participation in the events of the University, the municipality, "moderate reformers", some aristocrats and to construct a negative image of butchers and knackers, hungry for blood and money, who managed to lead the Parisian rabble. This image made it possible to contaminate the Paris events of 1413 and 1418. As always, the power of stereotypes turned out to be so powerful that phenomena of fundamentally different nature were combined here: in one case, it was about a movement based on municipal structures and amenable to socio-political interpretation, in the other - about a surge of wild violence comparable to St. Bartholomew's Night and the September murders of 1792.

AB The paper looks at the perception of Russian literature by the Czech Catholic magazine "Ar & scy;ha" in the 1920s, when a high degree of politicization of culture contributed to the extreme ideological differentiation of periodicals, and at the same time to the reception of the work of Russian writers, which in turn often served as a means of ideo- logical and political propaganda. In the literary magazine "Ar & scy;ha", which served as a platform for Moravian writers and critics, Catholicism was often identified with Christi- anity in general, that fact affected the perception of Russian literature, being assessed in the publications, on the one hand, from the point of view of the writers' attitude toward religion, and on the other hand - to the ideas of the Bolshevik revolution. When analyz- ing literary works, the magazine placed a strong emphasis on contrasting two cultures, Latin and Byzantine, but on the other hand, the value of the Christian community and the role played by Russian writers in the spread and strengthening of the true faith is undoubtedly recognized, sometimes even attempts are made to bring Russian culture closer to Catholicism. In addition, the moderate nationalism of the magazine's authors forms an opposition between the Slavic and Germanic worlds on the pages of the maga- zine. This combination of opposition and at the same time the search for commonality for Czech and Russian cultures in the confessional and national fields makes the maga- zine "Ar & scy;ha" a unique cultural phenomenon of the 1920s, which played a role in creat- ing a positive image of Russian literature in the eyes of the Czech public.

AB Introduction: the problem of the genesis and evolutionary development of criminal punishment as a social and legal phenomenon has long been among the relevant issues, especially during the periods of the clarification of goals and reorientation of criminal policy, during reforms in the penitentiary sphere. Purpose: based on the results of the conducted research, to reveal and analyze the causes and conditions of the formation of criminal punishment as a phenomenon of socio-legal reality, to identify regularities in its development over millennia, and to determine its role in social progress. Methods: the methodological framework of the study is based on widespread paradigms and epistemes of the sciences of criminal law, criminology and penology, as well as general scientific and special scientific methodological tools: comparative-historical, contrastive, functional, logical-and-semantic methods, the method of retrospection. Results: criminal punishment played a role, underestimated in axiology, of a behavioral limiter thanks to which there was laid and clearly outlined a 'watershed' between human society and its forerunner - the zoological drove. Criminal punishment, which appeared at the initial stages of anthropogenesis, sociogenesis and legal genesis, is an important and underestimated achievement on the path of civilizational progress. It contributed to the transition of a prehuman being (a member of a zoological drove), who lived in conditions of animal savagery, into a social individual, a subject of a formed society - a primitive tribal community. Conclusions: the regularities in the formation and development of criminal punishment show that it becomes less repressive and gradually gets more humanized with the socio-cultural, political, legal, spiritual, and ethical development of mankind. Criminal punishment evolves and undergoes substantive changes depending on the socio-economic, moral, and political conditions. Changes in the latter lead to transformations in the goals, forms, mechanism of influence, and ideological foundations of criminal punishment, modifying penitentiary practice, which is currently more focused on the prevention of criminal behavior, the re-socialization and correction of criminals, and the use of the types of criminal punishment that are alternative to isolation from society.

DE practical philosophy; patriotism; Kant; social philosophy; ethics;
   political philosophy; cosmopolitanism; duty; special obligations;
   nationalism
AB The article considers a paradoxical, at first glance, question - does the social andpolitical philosophy of Immanuel Kant allow patriotism as a duty. The fact isthat Kant is widely considered an icon of cosmopolitanism. His "cosmopolitan-ism" was reflected in such works as "Idea for a Universal History from a Cos-mopolitan Purpose" (1784), and later, with adjustments, in "Toward PerpetualPeace" (1795) and "Metaphysics of Morals" (1797). Considering that manyphilosophers reject patriotism on ethical grounds, believing that it cannot beavirtue, even more strange it may seem to pose the problem of "Kantian patriot-ism". Nevertheless, modern researchers of Kant's philosophy are trying to under-stand how his views can be combined with patriotism. In particular, this topicwas raised several times (in 2000 and in 2003) by Pauline Kleingeld, a re-searcher of ethics and philosophy of Kant. To answer the question of whetherpatriotism is obligatory, permissible, or even harmful for Kant's philosophy, shefirst described three types of patriotism - civic, nationalist, and patriotism basedon the unique characteristics of the country, Kleingeld has done a lot of philo-sophical work, because now Kant's social and philosophical concept can amongother things be considered patriotic.

   personality; stylistics; pragmatics
AB The article attempts to analyze the language personality of the authoritative conservative publicist Mikhail Katkov, who in 1863-1887 was the editor-publisher of the influential newspaper Moskovskie Vedomosti. The relevance of the stated problem is due to the growing interest in modern science in the study of the conservative press of the second half of the 19th century, its influence on public consciousness and the formation of ideological attitudes of the audience. The scientific novelty of the research consists in the introduction of new, previously unexplored material into scholarly discourse, in the analysis of Katkov's journalistic texts for the purpose of studying the structure and content of his language personality. The methodological basis of the study consists of works of Yu.N. Karaulov, W. von Humboldt, V.V. Vinogradov, E.D. Polivanov, M.M. Bakhtin, G.I. Bogin, V.A. Maslova, V.V. Ledeneva, T.V. Shmeleva. The level model of language personality proposed by Yu.N. Karaulov was implemented in the study of Katkov's language personality in the form of a comprehensive analysis of all three components: lexicon, thesaurus, and pragmaticon. The analysis of the thesaurus allowed us to demonstrate how Katkov's views were embodied in the concepts he implemented, the hierarchy of these concepts, as a result of the publicist's political preferences. The article presents a full range of language tools and techniques, with special attention paid to metaphor, which allowed us to conclude that Katkov's texts generated a type of journalistic metaphor new for that time, the main function of which is evaluation. A detailed study of the thesaurus and the lexicon that embodies its features allowed us to conclude that the highest level of Katkov's language personality - the pragmatist - reflects the national specifics and features of the publicist's linguistic and axiological picture of the world. In the course of the analysis, it became obvious that a large role in Katkov's texts, and therefore in the structure of his language personality, is played by various means of syntax. First of all, this represents such an important feature of Katkov as the logical presentation. The main functional type of text used by Katkov is reasoning; the syntactic forms and structures used by the publicist implement a variety of strategies and tactics of persuasion, which allows us to consider his language personality as the quintessence of oratorical skill. It is revealed that the language personality of Katkov reflects the peculiarities of his worldview, scientific and logical thinking, moral and ethical ideas, political views, national and cultural mentality. The linguostylistic and pragmatic analysis of the texts of Katkov's publications allowed us to conclude that his language personality is characterized by a variety of linguistic representations and a variety of possibilities in the expression of meanings, which was one of the reasons for such a strong influence of his journalistic texts on the audience.

AB This article examines the role of state policy and institutional factors in using qualitative and quantitative approaches in the study of the development of the national innovation system. The relevance of the work is due to the limitations of econometric modeling in terms of including institutional variables that are poorly formalized. The use of narrative and institutional analysis allows for the consideration of historical, political, and cultural factors, the identification of significant determinants of the innovation system, and the development of recommendations for innovation policy. In the first stage, a comparison of the conclusions of quantitative and qualitative approaches established that the factors in the development of the Russian innovation system partially overlap. However, narrative and institutional methods allowed for a deeper understanding of the financial factor (in terms of distribution mechanisms), infrastructure (in terms of its quality and the presence of specialists to work with it), and human resources (details about the specialization of staff). The analysis also allowed for the identification of additional factors in the Russian innovation system, such as temporal effects, demand, macroeconomic conditions, and the interaction of actors. In the second stage, a comparison of recommendations based on quantitative and qualitative approaches showed that the proposed measures in both cases generally coincide but differ significantly in the degree of detail. The results of narrative and institutional analysis show that to improve the cooperation of actors, it is recommended to synchronize the target performance indicators of all participants; to increase the accessibility of infrastructure - organize joint and remote access to it; and to increase trust in science and attract personnel - expand the coverage of this topic in the information space.

AB The book "Companions of de Gaulle" by M. Arzakanyan, a prominent Russian historian, Doctor of Historical Sciences, Professor and specialist in the history of France, is devoted to the life and to the work of the most prominent associates and successors of General de Gaulle. The author presents their biographies in a historical context, drawing a wide canvas of the political life of France in the twentieth century. Such key events as the Second World War, the Algerian problem, the specifics of the party and political life of France, as well as issues of state-building in the early years of the Fifth Republic are reflected. The specificity of the publication, as well as of the entire work of M.Arzakanyan, is that it pays great attention to the psychology of the actors. The author explores what influenced the characters, what guided their decisions, many of which became fateful for France. The main character of the book is Charles de Gaulle himself, who is invisibly present on its pages, uniting his companions and directing their activities. M. Arzakanyan's new work is a complement to her previous studies of de Gaulle's life and work, which received wide recognition.

DT Article
DE Russian idea; Eurasianism; neo-Eurasianism; place-development; culture;
   civilization
AB Eurasianism of the 1920s-1930s was one of the most original phenomena of the Russian emigre community. The Eurasianists proposed a new solution to the problem of Russia's civilizational identity, seeing it neither as Europe, norAsia, nor as the "center of the Slavic world", but as a unique, synthetic culturalentity - Eurasia. According to the initial, "right-wing" Eurasianists, the destinyof Russia and the Russian people is to recognize their Eastern roots, their distinction from the West, to lead the uprising of oppressed humanity against the West,and to establish a system of "continental states" that would eliminate the causesof wars and conflicts. The left-wing Eurasianists and the Eurasianists of the 1930s believed that the Russian Revolution opened a new era - an era of collectivismand socialism, but this socialism would not be Marxist; it would be a unique, religious socialism. In the 1990s and 2000s, the phenomenon of neo-Eurasianismemerged. The most prominent "media" figure of neo-Eurasianism was and re-mains A.G. Dugin. However, his understanding of Eurasianism is reduced to a geo-political theory, which appears as the "inverted geopolitics" of H. Mackinder, op-posing Land and Sea. A.G. Dugin understands Eurasia too broadly, includingEurope in it, in accordance with the concept of K. Haushofer. SpecialistsinEurasianism (particularly M.A. Maslin) rightly note that this contradictstheunderstanding of Eurasia by the classics of Eurasianism and, in general,theconcept of classical Eurasianism. Among other representatives of neo-Eurasianism of the 1990s and 2000s, one can note V.V. Kozhinov, A.S. Panarin,and S.G. Kara-Murza.

DE V.I. Lenin; I.V. Stalin; visual dual power; postage stamps; image of
   power
AB Images have always been a part of communication, including political communication, so the visual in the 1920s-1930s began to enter the daily life of the emerging new society and play a certain role in transmitting and constructing ideas about events and personalities, forming assessments, emotions and decisions. Almost immediately, the image of power begins to be associated with the new leaders of the proletarian state and participants in the October Revolution. However, before his death, V.I. Lenin deliberately sought to limit the extremes of such personification, in fact introducing a ban on the use of his image on postage stamps. Only the events of January 1924 radically changed the nature of the visualization of his image, triggering the mechanism of his sacralization, creating conditions for the gradual formation of visual dual power, including on postage stamps. From the mid-1920s. there is a steady tendency to fold the image of V.I. Lenin as a posthumous form of personality cult (mourning stamps, an image of a mausoleum, sculpture, architecture, honorary titles), and at the same time the image of I.V. Stalin as a form of a living personality cult, as a living embodiment of the future of the country. As a result, such postal dualism additionally ensured, both within the country and abroad, the actual balance of two personality cults combining the past, present and future of Soviet society and the state.

DT Article
DE Elite; nomenclature; federalism; regional policy; market reforms;
   sovereignty; "parade of sovereignties"; elections; Russian Far East
AB The purpose of the article is to identify the content and significance of Boris Yeltsin's visits to the Russian Far East in the 1990s. The historical research is based on the concept of the relationship between the center and the regions at different stages of the past. It is complemented by a positional analysis in which the belonging of a person or group to the elite is determined by their status and influence in the institutional structure of society. The article reveals the historical traditions and innovations of the phenomenon of visits to the region by representatives of the highest political circles. According to the authors of the article, all of them were associated with both turning events in the internal life of the country and landmark foreign policy events. Their distinctive feature was that they often turned out to be "accompanying" events when the leaders went to meetings with their counterparts from foreign countries. The content of the visits of state leaders to the Far East clearly shows the relationship with certain changes in power relations, with the implementation of the industrial course of development in the region, and the involvement of its resources in the all-Union economic complex. The conclusion is made about the peculiarities of Boris Yeltsin's trips, fi rst as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, and then as President of Russia in the face of the danger of disintegration during radical reforms. Yeltsin used visits to the Far East as a way to demonstrate his liberal ideas and focus on foreign experience. His visits provided a certain illusion of stabilization in relations between Moscow and the Far Eastern region, both for Yeltsin himself and among the local political elite.

DE ecological crisis; disenchantment of world; archaic; hospitality
AB The article presents the results of an analysis of the logic and ethos responsible for the environmental crisis of our time, and the conditions for the possibility of exiting it through their transformation. Despite the fact that this problem has been repeatedly discussed by researchers, such a factor as "disenchantment of the world" (Max Weber) remains undeservedly ignored. On the one hand, its result is anthropocentrism, around the figure of which values and ethos strategies are subsequently formed, leading to the thoughtless use of natural resources and environmental pollution. On the other hand, there is the objectification of the "world" and the "other-alien", which is deprived of its own ontological foundations. It is the communal practices of constructing the "other-alien" on a conventional basis that are largely responsible for the lack of effectiveness of environmental programs and initiatives. Thus, the subject-object episteme that dominates the "disenchanted" new European "world" not only initiates the environmental crisis of our time, but also creates an obstacle to exiting it. The idea of the reclamation of the " archaic" has analytical value for ecophilosophy, the " otherrationality" of which allows us to go beyond the boundaries of new European thinking, covered with a thick layer of technocratic illusions, political phantasms and value fictions. At the same time, archaic "other-rationality" is not exclusively a mental phenomenon, but is cast in ritual practices. The ritual of hospitality seems to unfold a symbolic map of "worlds" "here-now", linking the past, present and future and inextricably connecting different "worlds" and their inhabitants. The subject-object matrix of vision and action is completely inappropriate in its execution, and therefore the ontic experience generated by it, in its constitutive principles, is very far from the experience of modern European man. As a symbolic "anthropotechnique", hospitality can become a kind of provocation for a cognitive, existential and social turn, which will make responsible human interaction with the "world", permeated with an attitude of participation and care, possible.

DT Article
DE image of the future; political values; ideology; political culture;

AB The article considers dominant ideological values of the political culture of the contemporary Russian students as determining main directions for the formation of the political image of future Russia. The empirical basis of the article is the data of the sociological study "Students of Russia: Civil culture and life strategies" conducted on the all-Russian sample by the Center for Political Science of the ISPR of the FCTAS RAS in April-May 2023. The authors define ideology as a stable set of value patterns that compete in determining state policies and social development, and present a ranking of the most significant values of the youth's political culture, which will determine the configuration of the political field of Russia in the future. The authors insist on the hybrid nature of the student ideological consciousness as combining various components of political ideologies; moreover, about a third of students cannot decide on their political-ideological priorities, and 70 % do not support any political parties, which allows the authors to make a conclusion about political escapism of students, who do not see meaning in their participation in political processes. Such a low level of political participation correlates with low assessments of the state and government activities. The authors mention the influence of the "ideological self-identification" variable on students' ideas about the optimal future of the country and significant differences in the image of the future among supporters of different ideologies, which implies the need to both monitor and regulate the youth's ideological priorities. When emphasizing the reproduction of significant political values, the authors draw attention to ideological shifts in the consciousness of the younger generation as expressed in the growing importance of democratic values and the rule of law, which determines a demand for the transformation of the party system and political democratization.

   Narratives; Semiotics of Space; Frontier; East Prussia; Russia;
   Kaliningrad Region
AB The article is based on the materials of field research conducted in the Kaliningrad region in 2022-2023. The authors proceed from the idea of this region as a frontier emerged due to redefinition of jurisdiction of the territories of East Prussia after World War II and geopolitical transformations after 1991. Currently, the region is surrounded by EU countries, and this predetermines its perception as a civilizational frontier - a space of comparison between Russian and European ways of life, and intensified the politicization of local historical memory. The aim of the article is to examine the narratives underlying visual transformation of the cultural landscape of the Kaliningrad region since 1945, their relation to the tasks of de -actualization of the region's past, appropriation of German heritage and its integration into the Russian cultural space. Cultural landscape is defined both as a product and environment of human activity saturated with a variety of artifacts, and as a sign system that forms, preserves, and controls a certain vision of the world. The use of the semiotic paradigm allowed us to consider monuments as its long-term semantic accents. We also took into account the multiplicity of actors influencing the organization and reorganization of the cultural landscape, the variability of the correlation of political forces and opportunities, and the participation in the transformation processes of both power institutions that limit the possibility of alternative perception of reality, and society that resists ideological programming. The evolution of semantic dominants of the cultural landscape we analyzed in the context of shifts in the ideology and attitudes of regional society. We conclude that the compromise tactics of appropriation of the region's past, developed over time, are based on countering the challenges of the time and solving practical problems, rather than on political attitudes.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Siege of Toulon; Revolutionary Wars; French Revolution; historiography
AB The siege and capture of Toulon in 1793 by the troops of the French Republic continues to be of significant interest to historians, representing one of the most pivotal episodes of the Revolutionary Wars of 1792-1802. However, most researchers focused their attention on a comprehensive account of the military operations that led to the capture of the city by the Republicans. Conversely, they have only briefly addressed the circumstances that led to the anti-French coalition's unopposed capture of the French fleet's main base in the Mediterranean. Most historians merely alluded to the existence of a royalist conspiracy as the catalyst for the uprising of the townspeople in July 1793 against the local Jacobin authority and the subsequent capitulation of Toulon to the coalition. This interpretation of events was initially posited in the reports of the people's representatives to the Convention, and subsequently, during the Restoration era, in the writings of eyewitnesses and contemporaries of those events. This was done to ensure the king's favour to the townspeople. Historians of the Revolution adopted this interpretation and began to portray the Toulon population as fervent supporters of the monarchy in their writings. This concept was dominant for approximately a century until new approaches to the consideration of the Toulon epic emerged. The relentless pursuit of the underlying motives only served to further obfuscate the situation, rendering it increasingly challenging to ascertain the actual causes of these events. Consequently, historians gradually eschewed conspiracy theories in favour of a more nuanced examination of the role played by the inner-city conflict. Additionally, scholars turned their attention to the economic, political, and social factors that contributed to the anti-Jacobin uprising. Nevertheless, there is still no single, generally accepted approach in historiography that adequately explains the causes of the uprising in Toulon and the subsequent surrender of the city to the British.

AB This article provides an analytical overview of contemporary studies on the anthropometric history concerning the well-being dynamics of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries (Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany etc.). In recent decades, the concept of the "biological standard of living" has emerged, focusing on the fundamental, "human" dimension of a broader understanding of well-being. Within this framework, fundamental aspects of the existence of individuals, entire populations, and nations are examined, including the quantity and quality of nutrition, morbidity, material and psycho-emotional conditions, and the state of the environment. Indicators of the dynamics of the biological standard of living utilized in this studyare not monetary (GDP per capita, real incomes etc.) but anthropometric (average height, weight etc.) and demographic (mortality, life expectancy, etc.) characteristics. Anthropometric studies of socialist countries allow overcoming limitations of official sources on well-being, assessing the contribution of state medical infrastructure and social support to the biological well-being of individuals, as well as informal self-sustaining practices. They also enable a comparison of their standard of living with countries of different socio-economic and political structures, detailing the impact on well-being of both long-term developmental factors and short-term fluctuations and crises. Furthermore, the article objectively evaluates achievements in overcoming class, professional, regional, ethnic, and gender inequalities. While the results of anthropometric history studies on the population of the USSR and other socialist countries are significant, there remain unresolved, debatable questions, which are elaborated in detail in this comprehensive review article.

AB The article characterizes the scientific interests of the well-known English scholar, then political scientist and long-term head of the Perm political science school Liubov Aleksandrovna Fadeeva. The authors demonstrate that Perm professors, especially Lev Kertman, influenced Fadeeva's scientific research. The article analyzes the researcher's transition from historical to political research and the role Fadeeva played in forming and developing the Department of Political Science at Perm University. It is shown that under her influence the key research areas of Perm political scientists crystallized, operating at the cutting edge of political science and in close contact with political scientists from Russia and abroad. Paying attention to the individual and collective projects of Liubov Fadeeva, the authors demonstrate the researcher's loyalty to the "union of history and political science", as well as scientific traditions laid down by teachers of the History Faculty of Perm University and which became the basis for the scientific activities of a galaxy of Fadeeva's students. The authors state that union, cooperation and community are the markers of the scientific school created by Professor Fadeeva.

AB After the Second World War, the countries of Eastern Europe fell into the orbit of Soviet political influence. The process of Sovietisation of all aspects of society began. Czechoslovak historical science was no exception to this process. Soviet historiography was proclaimed as a reference point for national historiographies, and Soviet historians were very active in the region. At the same time, the destruction of the old foundations of historical science and the construction of new institutions in their place not only changed the "facade" and reshaped the former channels of communication, but also had an impact on the personality of the scholar himself, sometimes confronting him with a choice between resistance or accommodation. Therefore, turning to sources reflecting the personal expe-rience of living through the Sovietisation has great research potential. The article examines the memoirs of three Czechoslovak historians - J. Polisensky, F. Kavka, and M. Myska, with the help of which an attempt is made to reconstruct the perception of contemporaries of the processes of sovietisation and "self-sovietisation" of Czechoslovak historical science.

AB Regional governments commonly use e -government technologies when setting out to deliver value to the public. While the use of technology has become a standard of modern public management, risks and limitations associated with its use, such as lack of trust from constituents, need to be carefully examined in light of city experiences, an endeavor that is still scarcely undertaken in the context of smart city initiatives. Th is paper examines trust regarding online platform usage in St. Petersburg, Russia. The research questionnaire was based on a set of variables that characterize the experience of using information technologies in diff erent areas and in terms of attitudes towards them. A survey of 800 St. Petersburg residents was conducted (the sampling error does not exceed 4%, the confidence level is 95%) and statistical methods (correlation analysis, multiple regression, principal component analysis) were applied. Findings suggest that online trust is multidimensional and infl uenced by factors related to positive perceptions of institutions, political effi cacy of online initiatives, and satisfactory past experience. The implications of these findings and future directions are presented in the context of the e -government research agenda.

DE sovereignty; statehood; Russian constitutionalism; independence of

AB Introduction: paradigms of modern statehood have specific features that reflect the historical, philosophical, legal values of a particular country. Sovereign statehood is largely formed under the political, economic, sociocultural influence of bordering countries, due to geographical predetermination being neighbors throughout all the history of their existence. The territories of these states are often subject to changes in their political and legal belonging. At the same time, the common history of neighboring countries necessitates a search for models of mutual coexistence based on the principles of respect for their value foundations. The study of modern Russian-Finnish relations determines the politico-legal discussion about Russia's influence on the formation of sovereign Finnish statehood, which in recent years has gained new found relevance in the light of the ongoing transition from a bipolar world order to a multipolar one. Purpose: basing on historical facts, to develop approaches to the understanding of the significant Russian influence on the creation of modern Suomi statehood. Objective: to study the foundations of Finnish statehood in terms of its sovereignty and territorial integrity as reflected in legal documents. Methods: formal legal, comparative legal, historical legal. Results: the paper substantiates the thesis about the unconditional influence of Russia on the formation of modern sovereign Finnish statehood and its territorial integrity. Conclusions: contrary to the point of view, persistently imposed in recent years within colonial discourse, about the tough position of imperial Russia in relation to Finland, the creation of statehood of this country was predetermined by the influence that Russia had exerted over many centuries.

AB This article is dedicated to the anniversary of the researcher of the Baltic -Finnish languages N. I. Bogdanov (1904- 1959), one of the first scientists who came from the Vepsian people, and in the 1930s. took part in the creation of the Vepsian script, training of teachers and writing of textbooks for Vepsian schools. He developed the hypothesis of the Baltic -Finnish origin of the Vepsians, first formulated by his teacher, the outstanding Finno-Ugric scholar D. V. Bubrikh. N. I. Bogdanov wrote the first candidate's dissertation in our country on the Vepsians, in which the history of the people is examined on the basis of linguistic data. In the pre- and post-war years, he was a member of the leadership team of the Karelian Institute of Language, Literature and History. The article examines the scientist's life path against the background of his contemporary era, Soviet national politics and the scientific atmosphere of the 1930s-1950s. His contextual biography reflects the tragic pages in the history of the Vepsian and Karelian peoples associated with drastic changes in national politics, the difficult years of the Great Patriotic War, and the role of ideological and political factors in the activities of Soviet linguists.

AB The article is devoted to the Swiss philosopher Charles Secretan (1815-1895), unknown in our country. The article provides an outline of the life and work of the Lausanne thinker, based on letters and other documents from the family archive, carefully preserved by his daughter Louise Secretan. To understand the philosophy of freedom developed by Secretan, it is not enough to establish the intraphilosophical impulses received by the Swiss philosopher from Schelling, Kant and Maine de Biran. Secretan's philosophy of freedom, the author of the article believes, cannot be understood in its genesis without reference to a specific historical and cultural context, including the intellectual and political history of not only the Swiss Confederation as a whole, but also of the canton of Vaud, which is Secretan's homeland. The author of the article shows that Secretan's highest ideal, already in his youth, was freedom as an irrefutable reality and as the highest value, the symbol of which is the coat of arms of his canton. The article presents the idea that freedom in conjunction with will and morality forms the basis of the philosophical intuition, deeply rooted in the Secretan's consciousness, that emerged in him even before his meeting with Schelling, that only gave an incentive to reveal the already existing germ of his thought in the philosophical system. According to the author of the article, the study of Secretan's work allows us to better understand not only the insufficiently studied French-speaking spiritualism, the founder of which was Maine de Biran, but also to deepen our understanding of the essence of freedom. The analysis of Secretan's philosophy is carried out in the article in comparison with the Russian tradition.

DE Russia; France; discourse; cross-cultural studies; stereotypes; phobias;
   political myths; significant "Other"
AB Throughout history, Russian-French cultural relations have been varied, ranging from a near-absence during the early modern period to outright Gallomania in the 19th th c. These relations have included both military conflicts, such as during the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War, and the Entente alliance during the First and the Second World Wars. One of the most interesting periods for cross-cultural studies is the time leading up to Peter the Great's reforms, when Russia's role in European affairs increased. During this period, Russia was "rediscovered" by the West, and a political myth of a "barbaric" Russia was created. Therefore, it is essential to analyze texts from this period in order to understand how mutual perceptions between Russia and France evolved. Among these texts are "Dictionnaire Muscovite" by J. Sauvage (1586), "The Russian Empire and Grand Duchy of Muscovy" by J. Margeret (1607) and "A Curious and New Account of Muscovy in the Year 1698" by F. de La Neuville (1698). Analysis of these sources can give a general overview of the discourse about Russia and Russians in French society during that time. In many ways, the stereotypes that emerged during the 16th th and 17th th cc. continue to influence foreign policy relations between our countries. At the same time, the interaction between Russian and French cultures has been an important part of their common history. So, it is impossible to fully understand one's own identity without considering the influence of "significant Others".

AB The purpose of this publication is to introduce into scientific circulation the transcript of the meeting of the Directorate of the Marx Engels Lenin Institute (IMEL) dated November 20, 1940. The published source belongs to the problematic field of the history of historical science at the turn of the 1930s-1940s. The meeting reflected in the document became one of the few known to us "exchanges of views" within the institute on the development of the author's team of the biography of V.I. Lenin. The document complements the plots related to the functioning of the cult of personality of I.V. Stalin and its limits in Soviet historical science; gives an understanding of how the image of a professional revolutionary should appear; reflects the technical nuances that imposed objective restrictions on the author's team during the writing of the biography of V.I. Lenin. The creators of the text found themselves in a certain ideological framework: they were obliged to build the reviewed Lenin's works, focusing on the "Short Course of the history of the CPSU (b)". Separate text inserts and quotations of V.I. Lenin in the text of the biography were subject to the same kind of adjustments. The construction of the image of the leader from the point of view of his human qualities posed a large number of questions to the team of authors concerning the image of a professional revolutionary. How should one comprehend the theoretical heritage of the leader and how to combine it with practice? How should the portrait of V.I. Lenin be given? Is it worth showing the personality through everyday details (through a description of his rest, attitude to nature, etc.) or is it quite possible to limit yourself to showing high culture in the work and modesty of the leader? And is it necessary to set such a goal at all? Ultimately, during the discussion that unfolded during the meeting of the IMEL directorate, the team of authors decided to focus mainly on the political activities of V.I. Lenin, limiting themselves to only rare references to the personal life of a professional revolutionary. The source was identified in the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History (RGASPI) in f. 71.

AB The analysis of Russia's image in Germany at the end of the 19th century is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the relationship between the two countries. This article aims to reconstruct the image of Russian Pan-Slav- ism in Germany in the 1880s through the examination of four key figures (I. S. Aksakov, M. N. Katkov, N. P. Ignatyev, and M. D. Skobelev) and compare it with reality. The study draws upon a wide range of German and Russian sources, employing qualitative content analysis as the primary method. The findings indicate that German observers - state officials, party politicians, and publicists - generally accurately assessed the views of those Russian actors labeled as "leaders of PanSlavism." However, they significantly exaggerated the anti-German orientation of these views and the influence of the "Pan-Slavists" on Russian internal and, primarily, external policy. The "leaders of Pan-Slavism" were attributed much greater influence on Russian politics and society than they actually possessed. Additionally, their thoughts and activities were portrayed as predominantly anti- German. This situation can be attributed to a lack of information about political decision- making in Russia and a preconceived perception of Pan-Slavism primarily as a threat to Germany. Such perceptions contributed to the deterioration of Russian-German relations during the period under consideration.

AB The article is devoted to the epistolary heritage of Z.N. Gippius, a prominent representative of Russian social thought at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th c. and the Russians abroad. The question is raised about the potential of Z.N. Gippius' letters as a source for the study of Christian liberalism, whose representatives sought to synthesize the values of individual freedom and the spiritual foundations of social life. The features of Z. Gippius' epistolary creativity that could be important for research on the socio-political content of the letters are determined. Correspondence materials have been identified, which present the key theses of the Christian liberal doctrine in a politicized version developed by Z. Gippius and like-minded people, supporters of the "new religious consciousness". The epistolary sources that are most productive for studying the problems of the history of Christian liberalism are identified. It is demonstrated how Z.N. Gippius' letters reflect various aspects of her social concept, reaction to events in political life, information about the social activities of Christian liberalism representatives.

ID IMMIGRATION REFORM
AB The evolution of US migration policy has run several cycles: at first, the fate of immigrants was the responsibility of the employer (companies, who brought them to the USA), then, with an increase in their influx and their gradual resettlement, the lives of newcomers began to be determined at the state level. Only at the end of the 19th century migration regulation began to acquire the features of the federal government's established policy with a vector towards liberalization throughout the next century. Starting from the 2010s there is a reverse trend - back to restrictionism and 'descend' of the regulation to the level of state authorities, especially for illegal immigrants. Such shift causes a clash between states and federal government, and at the same time emphasises the inability of this government to carry out objectively aspired reform. Today immigration policy in the United States can be divided into two major areas: legal immigration regulation and government attempts to solve the problem of illegal immigration. This division, albeit conditionally, helps to understand why for 30 years now no Congress has been able to work out a comprehensive immigration reform or at least agree on key areas for the implementation of its' certain aspects. A set of acute problems of socio-economic, moral and ethical nature forms an inseparable set of challenges. It equally includes both the areas necessary for the country's successful economic development: highly qualified personnel attraction, aging of the nation combating, increase of the birth rate, and the challenges associated with the burden on society and the increase in crime: the influx of refugees, illegal, seasonal and permanent immigrants and their families. Due to domestic political peculiarities in the modern United States, party coalitions cannot agree on even one of these areas, let alone develop a profound working system that meets constantly changing needs of the economy, foreign policy challenges, and is in consensus with states' authorities, who would finally assimilate newcomers. Will the current crisis on the southwestern border of the United States affect J. Biden's reelection in November 2024? What strategy has D. Trump chosen to bypass his rival? - you will find from this article.

DE Deleuze and Guattari; Anti-Oedipus; desire; machine; science; laboratory
AB The aim of this article is to explicate the epistemological aspects of Deleuze and Guattari's conception of desire presented in Anti-Oedipus. Capitalism and Schizophrenia. I show that the schizoanalytic concept of desire as a " production of machines" is reflected in studies on a laboratory science. The epistemological meaning of the image of the "desiringmachine" is revealed, which is that to cognize means to experience the possibilities of the man-dimension to be involved in the various entanglements of the world - psychophysical, natural-technical, sociocultural. Through the use of historical and scientific material, I show that the concept of the nomadic subject is relevant to the description of a laboratory cognitive subject. I note that, on the one hand, the scientist is aware of himself as a researcher through territorialization, i.e. attribution of himself to tradition. On the other hand, the scientific cognition must also be treated as deterritorialization, i.e. the desire of consciousness to retreat themselves into a space in which it was possible to be outside of itself - outside of existing tradition. Thus, for the subject of cognition, it is immutable not only the requirement that "The 'I think' must be able to accompany all my representations" (Kant), but also the need to leave the sphere of the conscious as already thought out, held in the area of "the unconscious as passive syntheses of desire" (Deleuze and Guattari). I also demonstrate that in laboratory life the scientist is immersed in free syntheses of desire with non-linear, multivalued connections and inclusive disjunctions. However, in the narrations of historians and philosophers, as well as in scientific articles and reports, all this heterogeneous plurality and ambiguity is reduced. Scientific articles, reports, interviews are written, on the contrary, using linear, unambiguous connections and exclusive disjunctions, that is, in accordance with the Oedipal code. This circumstance points to a certain "Oedipalization of knowledge", analogous to the "Oedipalization of desire" that Deleuze and Guattari identified in relation to Freudian psychoanalysis.

AB Since the late 2000s, political science has been trying to figure out how governments use social media in their interaction with citizens and public policing. As for Russia, the process of active involvement of authorities in communication with citizens on social media and formation of new channels of e-participation has begun in 2020. In this regard, there is a need to assess the contribution of social networks to evolution of the communication system between the Russian government and society. The current paper aims at investigating the quality of deliberative practice between Russian authorities and citizens on social media in order to understand whether and how the results of social media dialogue between government and citizenry can be used and implemented in the process of public policymaking. For our study, we employ a medium-size case of an environment-related issue discussed on VK.com, comprising 1,286 comments of both citizens and governmental representatives. To assess the deliberative quality of discussion, we use two approaches: Discourse Quality Index (2003) and analytical approach developed by Misnikov (2011-2012). As a result, a selected online discussion can be described as 1) highly interactive, with dominance of hyperactive users; 2) unfocused, predominantly conducted on other issues; 3) weekly justified; 4) moderately civil, with little rates of incivility, but more towards citizens rather than towards government; 5) poorly constructive, with predominance of alternative proposals coming more from citizens than authorities; 6) more inclined towards agreement than otherwise, with slight tendency to cooperation between citizens and authorities.

AB Russian diaspora is one of the largest in the world and, according to various sources, includes from 10 to 40 million expatriates. It has been forming since the 18th-19th century during periods of unrest, wars and political change. Natural decline of Russian population, reduction in the migration growth of the population of Russia, and changes in ethnic composition determine the need and relevance of assessing the scale of the country's repatriation potential. The aim of the work is to analyze existing data sources and approaches to estimating the number of Russian-speaking population and to identify the countries in which it is concentrated, for subsequent assessment of Russia's repatriation potential. The article presents main approaches to identifying Russian expatriates, estimates the number and describes the geographical distribution of Russian-speaking communities abroad. The interpretations of such widely used concepts as "emigrants", "diaspora", "compatriots" and "Russian-speaking communities" are considered in detail and comprehensively, as well as the specifics of their definition and statistical accounting. We use data from the United Nations, national statistical services of various countries, and expert assessments. The data presented emphasize the importance of Russian-speaking communities in the context of globalization and international migration. The article provides statistics on international migration flows from Russia, including an analysis by country of residence and the dynamics of the number of emigrants since 1990. We discuss differences in migration statistics presented in Russian and foreign sources, methods of determining the basis (by place of birth, by ethnic origin), as well as new forms of emigration, including labor emigration and episodic emigration. The analysis of the territorial distribution of Russian-speaking communities shows their geographical diversity with significant presence in Russia's neighboring countries (Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan) and in other regions, including North America (USA, Canada), Europe (Germany, France, Baltic countries), and the Middle East (Israel, T & uuml;rkiye, UAE). The findings of our research can be useful in the development of state migration policy and assessment of geopolitical implications of migration processes, including the repatriation potential of the Russian Federation.

AB The article is devoted to finding out the importance and significance of the tsar's personal qualities in the structure of traditional folk ideas about the sacral nature of power. The source base of the research is folk Russian fairy tales (a group of magic tales containing the most archaic political notions) from the complete collection of A.N. Afanasyev. The author classifies fairy tale stories according to the status of pretenders to the throne and the way they obtained royal power. Four ways to the throne are identified: inheritance, election in accordance with the omen, tsareuicide and marriage to a tsarevna. It is established that the wedding plays a major role in the issue of acquiring the throne. It not only a ritual of entry into adulthood, but also full of mortal dangers test. Marriage to the tsarevna and conquest of the kingdom are the main conditions for the accession of the pretender to the throne. The author concludes that the folk consciousness attaches decisive importance in gaining and retaining power to the presence of charisma- the ability to use internal or external supernatural forces to gain the throne. According to the author's conclusion, such folk ideas about the subject of power go back to the archaic image of the chief-priest, whose connection with the world of the supernatural is an indispensable condition for ensuring the good of the whole society.

AB The relevance of the observation is determined by the practical and scientific necessity to overcome the patterns in conceptualizing the phenomenon of trust/distrust. The disadvantage of most studies, regardless of the scientific field, is the confidence in a generally accepted concept of trust. Therefore, most sociological diagnostics are usually reduced to identifying some kinds of indices and averages of trust, satisfaction, and expectations of medical care consumers. This leads to the illusion of understanding the public opinion and social moods on this issue. The cognitive framework is also associated with the fundamental evaluative opposition of society's trust in medical care as a blessing and distrust as a socio-cultural barrier to the development of the healthcare system. In this regard, the aim of the research is to conduct a comprehensive reassessment of social perceptions, practices, behavioral attitudes that form a system of indicators of public trust in the healthcare institution. The study is based on the paradigm of social constructivism. This methodological strategy makes it possible to study both mental and institutional factors that shape the ambivalence of public trust in healthcare services. The author argues that social trust is constructed as a result of activities and communication, and requires directed efforts and an active position of key agents. At the same time, behavioral indicators of trust should be supplemented with information about objective indicators of the accessibility and quality of medical care. The author suggests the following criteria to a sociological assessment of social trust in the healthcare system: the attitude of medical care consumers to doctors and medical organizations; the degree of satisfaction in medical needs and self-assessment of one's health; typical practices of self-preservation behavior; emotional mood, fears and expectations from medical intervention; preventive activities; predisposition to medical risk; the information field of medical choice.

AB In the context of modern political development, the space policies of certain states are becoming increasingly autonomous and politically driven, playing a significant role in shaping a new world order. Advances in science and technology have broadened the scope of participation in outer space activities, incorporating not only state actors but also private enterprises, thereby introducing additional challenges and complexities. Analyzing the actions and competition among the major space actors reveals the emergence of a new space order, where space exploration serves as both a strategic asset and a practical tool of foreign policy. This study focuses on space as a domain of political interaction among states in the era of globalization. Using a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach, the research identifies key issues on the global space agenda and examines the dynamics of state interactions as a foundation for achieving stability in both outer space and the broader geopolitical landscape. The study analyzes the space programs of leading nations, including the United States, China, and Russia, highlighting the dual dynamics of cooperation and competition. Additionally, it explores the efforts of advanced space powers to involve developing countries in space activities. Through cluster analysis, the study classifies the world's key spacefaring nations into three groups: the United States (the undisputed leader in the space industry); China and Russia (key competitors and strategic partners of the U.S.); and a group including India, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, and South Korea (countries without independent human spaceflight capabilities). Importantly, many space powers prioritize achieving global military- political objectives through their space programs. The study also highlights a new type of cooperation between the Russian Federation and China, suggesting the emergence of a "new center of space power". This partnership, characterized by initiatives such as the integration of satellite navigation systems (GLONASS and Beidou), the construction of an international lunar research base, and plans for a joint space station in low Earth orbit, underscores significant opportunities for collaborative scientific endeavors. While the traditional U.S.-Russia partnership has been a major factor in space politics, the current geopolitical climate signals a decline in this cooperation, paving the way for stronger Sino- Russian collaboration.

AB The aim of this study is to understand the origins and the key elements of orthodoxy in economicscience. We will look back on the history and assess how certain ideas and beliefs have affected the development of economic knowledge over time. The paper also explores the negative impact these concepts and doctrines have on the development of modern economics. We focus on several historical periods, which are qualitatively different from each other. Firstly, we consider the key elements of economic orthodoxy, which emerged during the development of economic thought. In particular, the article examines the characteristics of orthodoxy in the views of proponents of mercantilist economic ideology, who overstated the principles of protectionism and empiricism, and the views of the classics of political economy, who emphasized the freedom of entrepreneurial activity (economic liberalism), as well as the causal approach in economic research. Then, we analyze the trends of economic thought that emerged after classical political economy: economic romanticism, utopian socialism, neoclassic theory, the German historical school, institutionalism, Keynesianism, and neoliberalism. These currents of economic thought are associated with the periods when orthodoxy in economics was being overcome. The novelty of this study is threefold. (1) We summarize and systematize the theoretical, methodological, and socially oriented reformist propositions that shaped propositions alternative to the orthodox ones. (2) We show that the key components of orthodoxy today hinder the development of economic science and economic education. (3) The article substantiates that only by overcoming orthodoxy will the modern scientific, economic, and educational community be able to avoid perceiving economic theories as suitable for all societies and all times, as well as from distinguishing them into "Western" and "non-Western", "bourgeois" and "non-bourgeois" ones.

DE John Toland; Deism; Protestantism; Enlightenment; Christianity
AB John Toland (1670-1722) is one of the most original and underrated religious philosophers and theologians of the early British and Western Enlightenment. The main trends of Western Tolandiana are quite successfully and voluminously presented in the master's thesis of Jeffrey Wigelsworth. The historiographical calculations found there well illustrate the significant contribution of many scientists to the historiography of Toland's intellectual work. At the same time, the proposed article is intended to draw attention to the problem of serious obstacles created by a number of stable historiographical traditions for a non-stereotypical interpretation and understanding of the content and essence of Toland's certain views. The most consistent of such traditions is the qualification of his religious-philosophical and theological ideas as Deistic. It is suggested that one of the decisive circumstances that most likely contributed to the establishment of Toland's reputation as a Deist - a critic of Christianity - was the negative ideologization and politicization of the concept "Deism" that spread in early modern British society, fueled by considerations about the anti-Christian, anti-religious orientation of Deistic ideas. Apparently, the mentioned concept was used in confessional polemics to collectively designate religious-philosophical, theological views and doctrines of a rationalistic nature. New interpretations of the provisions of the treatise " Christianity without Mysteries" - Toland's main work on the problems of Christian religious philosophy and theology, are being tested. The author of the article proceeds from the fact that Toland adhered to the program of reconciliation of reason and Christian faith on the basis of correcting Christian religious-philosophical and theological views by abolishing ideas about the "mysteries" of Christianity - dogmas, doctrines, etc., considered inaccessible to reason (superintelligent). A number of fragments of the second and third sections of the treatise "Christianity without Mysteries" are reviewed. On this basis, Toland's conceptual religious-philosophical and theological attitudes are revealed, and their essence is characterized. It is shown that the religious-philosophical and theological ideas contained in the treatise do not have an anti-Christian and anti-religious orientation, despite the acute heterodoxity and polemic of some of them.

DE John Toland; deism; theology; matter; motion; natural philosophy
AB John Toland (1670-1722) is known as one of the most extraordinary and bright representatives of the early British and certainly of the Western European Enlightenment as a whole. He is recognisable for his controversial religious-philosophical and natural philosophical ideas, usually qualified as deistic, materialistic, pantheistic. The historiography of Toland's religious-philosophical views is quite extensive. As a rule, Russian and Western specialists emphasise deistic, materialistic-atheistic, pantheistic attributes of Toland's religious-philosophical ideas, criticism and subversive nature of this ideas - orientation either against any Christian religious and theological doctrines, or against religion in general. The focus of this article is Toland's natural philosophical views on matter and motion, as expressed in the fourth and fifth letters (addressed to an unnamed Dutch Spinozist) of the work Letters to Serena (1704). In general terms, Toland's natural philosophical materialism has been and still is evaluated by many Russian and Western specialists only as a forerunner of modern forms of natural-scientific materialist discourse, as a predictable complement to his subversive religious-philosophical ideas. Toland is also predominantly identified as a thinker who sought to liberate natural philosophical views on matter and motion from theological constructs as much as possible. Vivid examples of the embodiment of such and similar interpretative attitudes when reading Toland's reflections on matter and motion are presented in the studies of B.V. Meerovskiy and J. Brown. However, the author of this article is inclined to take the side of those scholars who, when interpreting Toland's deistic and materialistic views, prefer to fix the presence of meaning-forming theological foundations in these views in a reasoned and justified manner. Such scholars include, for example, J. Champion and J. R. Wigelsworth. The article reviews a number of fragments of the fourth and fifth letters of Letters to Serena, which contain Toland's conceptual judgements on matter and motion. The main ideas and propositions of these judgements are also highlighted. This allowed to identify and objectify some basic explicit (outlined directly in Letters) theological premises of Toland's natural philosophical views on matter and motion.

   Empire
AB The history of the Asia is one of the most topical areas of foreign historiography. Over the last three centuries Asia has undergone enormous and far-reaching changes: colonization, wars, revolutions, occupation, and industrialization. Authors are increasingly turning to the study of various aspects of the economic, political and social history of certain countries, as well as making a broader analysis of regional problems. For Russian historiography, the works on the Russian-Chinese frontier and frontiers are of the greatest interest. The transition to the modern image of border regions is largely attributed to the advent of the period of imperialism. The key argument is that from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, systemic migration factors were favorable for the influx of Chinese and Russian migrants to the border regions. Negative political influences at crucial moments often outweighed these systemic advantages and prevented the formation of stable communities. We note the series of books by Routledge Publishers on the New Asian History, separate monographs already translated into Russian on this topic. The article focuses on two new works - S. Urbanski's book, which conceptualizes the space of the Russian-Chinese borderland and frontier, and a collective work by the University of Belfast, published in 2023 as a result of an international research project. This article pays particular attention to the so-called imperial period, which laid the foundations for the more rigid politics of the twentieth century. The economics of imperialism in the frontier would play a less significant role than the traditional trade relations, economic systems established in previous eras.

AB The subject of the study is the theory of federalism in the Russian legal science of the 1920s. The purpose of the article is to reconstruct the theories of federalism of the 1920s based on the study of a wide array of publications of this period. The research methodology includes the following methods. The chronological method allowed us to distribute legal facts and their interpretations in chronological order. The comparative legal method was used to compare legal phenomena and institutions of different periods. The method of hermeneutics was used in the interpretation of texts. The following scientific results were obtained. The 1920s were a special period in Russian legal science. The ideological demands of the Soviet government formulated an urgent scientific agenda. At the same time, the political regime of this period allowed for relative freedom of scientific activity. The discreteness and continuity in the study of the problems of federalism are noted. In Soviet conditions, the federal theme was of particular relevance because of its practical significance. The development of the theory of federalism was carried out simultaneously with the approval of the Soviet federal state, the legal consolidation of relations between its subjects. The organizational center for the study of the theory and practice of federalism was located in the system of academic scientific institutions. The problems of federalism in the legal perspective were studied within the framework of state law. In addition, they were part of the subject of a new complex industry, which became known as "Soviet construction". Publications of the 1920s reflected the interdisciplinarity of research interpretations. In the comparative legal aspect, the theory of federalism and types of federations were studied. In the political aspect, the features of the Soviet federation, its differences from the federations of the bourgeois type were studied. The practice of Soviet construction was analyzed and generalized from a practical perspective. The key research issue of the 1920s was to determine the legal nature of the Soviet Federation. Definitions of the legal nature of the RSFSR and the USSR were given. An important conclusion was made about the continuity and continuity of the forms of the Soviet federation. Many questions remained debatable. Clarity was not achieved on the following issues: on the composition of the subjects of the RSFSR; on the combination of national and state sovereignty. For the first time, the question of the place and role of the historical Russian center within the USSR was raised. During the period of the 1920s, priorities in the study of the problems of federalism changed. At the beginning of the period, the main attention was paid to the study of the federation as an effective way to solve the national issue. The federal structure was considered a transitional form of the Soviet state. A state built on the principles of proletarian internationalism was declared promising. At the end of the 1920s, the concept of a large unified state was most actively developed. It was proved that within the framework of the USSR, national demands are satisfied and the interests of all nations are respected.

It demonstrates dynamics and structures of institutional and generalized trust in the Tyumen region from 2013 to 2023. Comparative interregional assessments of institutional and generalized trust, as well as the potential for growth of public activity across seven Russian regions in 2023, are offered, too. The analysis addresses contradictions in the interrelationships among key social capital resources. A typology of public participation - categorized into "active," "political participants," "public activists," and "passives" - was developed using the example of the Tyumen region residents and subsequently used to evaluate its connection to social capital. The study illustrates increasing public activity levels, primarily linked to generalized trust and communicative resources. Barriers to the growth of engagement in socially beneficial activities are identified.

AB International political crisis of 2022-2023 has changed the environment of interaction between Russia and Kyrgyzstan. The research questions of this article are the following: to what extent did this international crisis affect labor and educational migration between Russia and Kyrgyzstan? Did any new aspects emerge in this area as a result of the crisis, and to what extent might they become the mid- or long-term trends? Literature analysis covered the studies of leading Russian and foreign specialists. Since migration between Russia and Kyrgyzstan in 2022-2023 has not been covered in research literature yet, authors also relied on statistical data from national departments and international organizations including UNESCO, World Bank and IOM. Labor migration between Kyrgyzstan and Russia is traditionally encouraged by differences in population growth rates, wages and living standards. International crisis 2022-2023 reduced the interest of Kazakhstani and Kyrgyzstani citizens in Russian labor market, although to a lesser extent than other Central Asian states. Labor migration from Kyrgyzstan to Russia continued as remittances support many households in Kyrgyzstan. In addition, many Kyrgyz migrants settle in Russia due to personal connections; thus, it is difficult for them to redirect to other markets. The anti-immigrant rhetoric, which intensified in Russia in 2023, and the weakening of rouble may have unfavorable impact, but the potential for labor migration from Kyrgyzstan to Russia remains. A new phenomenon in 2022 was an increase of arrivals from Russia to Kyrgyzstan, but this is unlikely to be a long-term trend.Educational migration from Kyrgyzstan to Russia is supported by difference in higher education quality and the opportunity for Kyrgyz citizens to study for free. Enrollment to Russian universities from Kyrgyzstan increased in 2022, but fell in 2023, Aalthough to a lesser extent than from other Central Asian countries. In general, labor and educational migration from Kyrgyzstan to Russia in 2022-2023 remained an important part of the Eurasian migration system. They also continued to be influenced by previously established push and pull factors, as well as facilitated numerous interstate and and the action of numerous interested intermediaries.

The study of this era has a special appeal in connection with the experi-ence of positive political, scientific and technical interaction between two superpowers: the USSR and the United States, - an experience that lacks at present days. One of the brightest symbols of the D & eacute;tente was the joint Soviet-American space experimental program "Apollo-Soyuz Test Project" (ASTP), within the framework of which joint docking of spacecraft in orbital space was carried out. Based on documents from the Archive of Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation, the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History and other published sourc-es, including American ones, the article examines the history of the ASTP program as an important element of cooperation between superpowers in space during the years of detente. Special attention is paid to the factors that led to the beginning of cooperation, as well as the reasons why the docking of Soyuz and Apollo was not followed by projects comparable in scale and brightness. The authors come to two key conclusions. Firstly, the ASTP program, which arose as a purely scientific and technical project arising from the urgent tasks of developing manned space exploration, was inscribed in 1972 into the general agenda of bilateral relations between Moscow and Washington and became a politically significant project for both sides, the value of which was not directly related to its scientific and technical content. Secondly, the history of the ASTP clearly reflected the specifics of bilateral relations in the context of detente - both sides sought cooperation, but at the same time had clear limits of permissible actions and concessions, for which they did not go over.

AB This study is focused on analyzing the dependence of identity on internal and external factors and emphasizing the conditions of its realization. In this article, I delve into the understanding of identity formation and outline the conditions that affect the realization of identity through the consideration of existing theoretical positions in the field of identity. In this regard, the understanding of identity, the dependence of its formation and functioning on internal and external factors is specified. The scientific novelty of this study consists in clarifying the influence of external and internal factors on the construction and functioning of identity and highlighting the possibility of false definition of the subject's identity. The complex system and dynamics of interaction include many components that can affect the realization of identity. The realization of identity includes the consistent formation of the subject's representation of oneself and the actualization of this representation, which is related to the expectations and requirements of the social space and the real regularities of the subject's existence in the world. Topical theoretical positions on the formation and functioning of identity touch upon the problem of the impact of internal (personal) and external (social) factors. The internal factors of identity construction and realization include genetic and neurobiological features, values, motivational sphere, needs, moral responsibility, experience, skills and abilities, internal structure and dynamics of the psyche, and meaning. External factors include culture, social environment, education, social institutions, political movements, macro-social processes, and social relations. Globalization and virtualization put an additional burden on the preservation of identity. This article identifies the conditions of identity realization: possession of certain qualities and characteristics; reading of these qualities with minimization of distortions; inclusion in social relations and acceptance of the impact of external factors; actualization of identity in action; acceptance of identity by "others". From violations of the conditions of formation of identity can be formed a corresponding type of unrealized identity: untenable, substituted, latent, residual, confrontational, false-recognized. The basis for the fulfillment of the conditions of identity realization is the absence of conflict between internal and external factors that determine the subject's identity.

AB In the article, based on the analysis of existing works on the status of the state and its components, the author attempts to conceptualize and operationalize the concept of the subnational unit's status. As in the majority of works, that in one way or another concern the subnational unit's status, the term is used without any preliminary definition, the author firstly refers to the studies of the status of the state as the starting point to examine this topic, and then offers her own version of a complex definition of the subnational unit's status, which includes three main groups of characteristics: formal norms, resources (economic, political, social) and collective perceptions. Based on this definition, as well as on the studies devoted to the concepts of federalism, regional autonomy and regional political regimes, the author highlights more narrow elements of status, using Russian regions' status as an example. Although not universally applicable, the list of variables she compiles clearly demonstrates the opportunities of measuring subnational unit's status. When transitioning from the Russian realia to the experience of other states with a different administrative, territorial and economic structure, only a specific set of status elements changes, while its general structure remains intact. The definition of the subnational unit's status elaborated by the author, and the conclusions presented in the article as a whole can be useful in studying not only subnational unit's status, but also regional political regimes, regional autonomy and other related topics.

AB Difficult and controversial, with setbacks, the process of reintegration of the CIS countries is largely failing in the humanitarian sphere. Humanitarian communications in the field of education, science, culture, art, etc. have long remained on the periphery of the attention of political elites of the new independent states, or the elites even deliberately hampered them. Only in recent years, due to the revealed high conflict potential of the factor of value-based orientation of the population ("identity wars") and the increasing incidence of cultural clashes, this component of integration started to be included in the Russian political discourse. The article is devoted to the study of professional communications between experts in the field of humanities from six CIS countries: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia. The study is based on the expert survey conducted jointly by the International Non-Profit Association of Research Companies "Eurasian Monitor" and MGIMO University. Based on the experts' responses, the Communication Orientation Index (COI) was designed, which allowed to identify priority geopolitical vectors of interaction for the countries under consideration. According to the COI values, some of the CIS countries included in the analysis have similar communication profiles. Russia and Belarus demonstrate a high degree of self-orientation (however, Belarus also shows orientation toward Russia). Armenia and Azerbaijan are more oriented toward the EU and North America. Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan are located between these two poles. Among the factors influencing the COI values, the authors emphasize the role of the financial factor. According to their conclusion, the creation of funds like Russian Science Foundation, designed to finance international research projects and activities in the Northern Eurasian region, is one of the most important conditions for developing professional communication between specialists in the field of humanities in CIS countries.

AB This article explores the distinctive features of the economic and cultural interactions between the USSR and Sweden from 1924 to 1937. The research is grounded in a comprehensive array of sources, including official documents, publications from the periodical press, and personal accounts. The methodological framework is informed by the imagology of international relations, which focuses on the study of mental geography, transnational imagery, perception stereotypes, and myths, as well as the comparison of the "Self" and the "Other" to understand the role of "Others" in shaping national self-conceptions. The author investigates how shifts in Swedish perceptions of Soviet Russia influenced the development of bilateral relations and assesses the contributions of A.M. Kollontai, the Soviet ambassador to Sweden since 1930, to Soviet-Swedish interactions. The article illustrates how Swedish political figures, pursuing their own interests, viewed elements of Soviet society as potential models for reforming their own countries, shaped by their internal agendas of political and socio-economic change.

AB This article explores the political dimensions of regional communication, focusing on its emotional expressiveness and the impact of gender and social differentiation in speech. The objective is to develop an adaptive model for analyzing emotive communication in a political context, specifically examining how social factors influence the expression of anger in speech. The study's basis is quasi-spontaneous communication models - "woman-man" and "manwoman"-employed by Russian and Kabardian ethnic groups in the Caucasian Mineralnye Vody region, which has significant politological implications. The research delves into how emotions interplay with language in political discourse and the automated recognition of emotions at both verbal and non-verbal levels. The paper presents findings from an acoustic analysis of vowels using Praat 5.3.32 software, highlighting the effect of gender and national communication styles on the acoustic properties of the primary vowels /u/, /a/, and /o/ in emotionally charged statements of anger. These findings have profound implications for understanding political communication within this region, providing insights into the emotive underpinnings of political dialogue and rhetoric.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of a source stored in the Archive of Foreign Policy of the Russian Empire - the reports of Vasily Valentinovich Musin-Pushkin-Bruce, a Russian diplomat at the court of the Neapolitan king Ferdinand IV. Fleeing from the French troops approaching Naples, he went to Sicily after the royal court. From there, from the city of Palermo, Musin-Pushkin-Bruce wrote reports to the Russian emperor Paul I, in which he outlined the events taking place in southern Italy after the French captured Naples and established the Neapolitan Republic there in January 1799. This source was used by Russian researcher Galina Alekseevna Sibireva, who published the monograph "The Kingdom of Naples and Russia in the Last Quarter of the 18th Century" in 1981. However, due to the fact that Sibireva's focus was on the development of economic, political and cultural ties between the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Naples, a number of events remained outside her interests, information about which we can glean from this source. The Musin-Pushkin-Bryus reports allow us to reveal such aspects as the social composition of the republican and anti-revolutionary forces, the importance of religion in the life of Neapolitan society and the role it played in the resistance of the population of Southern Italy to the republicans, and also to trace who organized the unrest in Sicily, which became an echo of the Neapolitan events

AB The article discusses the issues of publication activity of the journal << Socis >> on education issues over 50 years of its work. The periodization of the journal's publishing activities on education issues is proposed. Its four periods are characterized: 1974-1989, 1990-2000, 2001-2010, 2011-2024. The article reveals the growth trend of the journal's publication activity on education issues over the past half century. The process of formation of the author's asset on the problems of education, which includes the leading sociologists of the USSR and Russia, is shown. At the first stage, a system of "educational" headings is being formed, the publications of which reflected the constitution of the sociology of education as a branch of knowledge, its interaction with the sciences of education, "ideological" dependence on the position of the party leadership, as well as interest in school and vocational education in the country. The specifics of the publications of the second period, characterized by an interest in higher and sociological education, and in the methodology of studying educational problems, are revealed. The journal articles of the third stage reflect the expansion of research areas of education of different types and levels, as well as the dominance of the problems of higher education and university communities. The specificity of the fourth stage is revealed - an appeal to acute discussions about the fate of Russian education in the context of institutional reforms, social, economic and political challenges, and the connection of education with other subsystems of society.

AB The study of the evolution of scientific knowledge relies on a dual framework: evolutionary and social epistemology. The complex fusion of these frameworks reveals the symbiotic relationship between cognitive processes and social mechanisms crucial to scientific enquiry. Underpinning this study is the key assertion that scientific enquiry goes beyond the mere accumulation of data to become a profound tool for unravelling cosmic motivations. This fusion of methodologies and theoretical insights not only broadens the scope for exploring the evolutionary and adaptive mechanisms of scientific theories, but also signals a paradigm shift driven by interdisciplinary methods and the transformative impact of computational tools. Key to this study is the innovative application of evolutionary epistemology; here, scientific theories are likened to biological entities undergoing the rigours of natural selection, thereby illuminating the adaptive nature of knowledge systems. Such a perspective is crucial for studying the sustainability of theories - not as a simple linear accumulation of facts, but through significant evolutionary leaps and paradigm shifts. As analysis advances into the digital age, the focus shifts towards integrating big data and artificial intelligence into revolutionary research methods; this transition follows a precarious path of opportunity and risk, with particular attention to issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and ethical concerns. The author also advocates for open science, imagining a democratised scientific field. The author concludes with a call for future research in evolutionary and social epistemology, calling for the adoption of innovative methodological frameworks that integrate different scientific disciplines and take into account the profound impact of digital technologies on knowledge production. The article advocates a deep, reflexive approach to scientific enquiry, recognising the multifaceted nature of knowledge production and the myriad ethical, social and technological challenges facing contemporary science.

AB Under the formation of a polycentric world order, the analysis of the existing social- cultural and political- legal foundations for the development of inter- civilizational dialogue becomes especially relevant. For Russia, the priority task is to find new grounds in the turn to the East to intensify relations with the countries of the Global South and border states. The authors use the tools of civilizational political science to consider the political- legal foundations of interaction between Russia and Mongolia as states- civilizations - the contractual basis and political discourse that determine the key directions of development of relations between Russia and Mongolia under Russia's turn to the East. The authors assess the representation of the civilizational factor in the historical and currently valid political- legal documents; propose ways for its strengthening through the consolidation of those provisions that affect the civilizational dimension of bilateral relations in the interests of specifying and intensifying Russian Mongolian cooperation. Based on the materials of the exposition in the National Museum of Chinggis Khaan (Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar), the article provides abrief description of the stages of development of the Mongolian civilization and its historical- cultural heritage as a platform for intercivilizational and interstate cooperation in the form of bilateral relations between Russia and Mongolia, the Russia- Mongolia-China triangle and more global forms of interaction with the participation of the states- civilizations of Eurasia and BRICS. As a result of the conducted research, the authors show, on the one hand, the insufficiency and fragmentation of the regulation of Russian- Mongolian relations at the level of bilateral agreements; on the other hand, significant provisions of a "civilizational" nature in the fundamental foreign policy documents of both countries. Together with the need to formalize inter- civilizational cooperation at the international level and the historical role of the Mongolian and Russian civilizations in Eurasia, this allows to identify some prospects for developing such provisions and introducing new ones in the international regulatory frameworks by both Russia and Mongolia in order to ensure a solid value- ideological, social- cultural and political- legal foundation for a polycentric world.

ID ISLAMIC EDUCATION
AB This article examines the changes in the Islamic education system in the Kingdom of Morocco during the period of independent development. The primary objective of the study is to explore the unique Moroccan experience of integrating two distinct educational systems: Islamic and secular. The Moroccan practice may serve as a valuable example in light of the pressing issues of countering Islamist radicalism and extremism. The paper discusses the historical context, the reasons for governmental and societal attention to this topic, and the key stages in the transformation of the religious education system. An analysis of the prospects for Islamic education in contemporary Moroccan society is also provided. The research draws on official documents from the Moroccan Ministry of Education, national legislation, and royal speeches addressing this issue. It is demonstrated that throughout the second half of the 20th century and into the early decades of the 21st century, Moroccan authorities viewed the Islamic education system as a primary tool for influencing the political sphere, a key institution for shaping national culture, and a means to strengthen loyalty to the state. It is asserted that reforms in the Islamic education system in Morocco have enabled it to become more modern and relevant while simultaneously preserving the cultural traditions and uniqueness of the country.

   Communities in France; Discrimination
AB The article analyzes the transformation of migration policy in France in recent years. French immigration policy, following in the wake of the common course of the European Union, implies the adoption of increasingly restrictive laws in an assimilationist logic. The changes also apply to immigrants from Africa, who make up 46.1% of all immigrants living in France. Based on the analysis of statistical data and official documents regulating migration between the EU and France on the one hand and African countries on the other, the article examines the historical context and the current state of the African immigrant community in France, and draws conclusions about the excessive politicization of the immigration issue. The reasons for the migration of Africans to France, the composition of communities, and the situation of African immigrants in France are analyzed. Special attention is paid to the causes and consequences of the politicization of the migration problem in France. The article examines the latest changes in French immigration legislation and their impact on the situation of African immigrants. It is concluded that in modern French political discourse, immigrants of African descent are represented as problematic groups of the population unsuitable for integration into the French society. The risk of forming the immigration policy for reasons of political expediency lies in the fact that immigrants from African countries find themselves in an increasingly disadvantaged position in France.

DT Article
DE France; yellow vests; Emmanuel Macron; protest movement; social
   portrait; democratic deficit
AB The "yellow vest" protests that happened in France during the period from the late 2018 to the fi rst half of 2019 became one of the key events of E. Macron's fi rst presidential term. The largest protest movement since 1968 was caused by a complex of socio-economic and political problems including the polarization of employment, the erosion of the middle class, the democratic defi cit, and the expansion of forms of civic and political participation. The purpose of the article, which examines the socio-value portrait of the yellow vests consists of several aspects. First, the author demonstrates which socio-professional and age groups formed the core of the protest, and what were the reasons behind the protest. The issue of low representation of French youth among protesters is touched upon. Author traces the correlation between the involvement in the protest and the income level, place of living and key aspects of the perception of the economic and political situation in the country. The article shows the relationship between the emergence of the movement and long-term changes in the labor market, the polarization of the middle class and the increasing divergence between its lower and upper strata. The author of article analyzes the value portrait of the yellow vests and the correlation in the motivation of the protesters of materialistic and post-materialistic values. The analysis of the values of the "yellow vests" is based on a wide range of social surveys and data from the World Values Survey. Author shows how the request for "vests" combined materialistic demands and consumer desires with a request for visibility and the opportunity to have more infl uence on the socio-economic policy of the state. Finally, the study of the political positioning of the yellow vests allows us to look at the causes and meaning of the movement in a broader context.

AB The demise of the USSR and the revision of the Yalta-Potsdam system of international relations led to tectonic changes in the Baltic Sea region: it became apparent that the northern flank, once the most likely battleground between the North Atlantic Alliance and the Warsaw Pact, had a historical opportunity to transform into a region of intensive political, economic, educational and cultural interaction. Under these circumstances, the construction of a new regional system of international relations unfolded at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries. This article examines the evolution of the regional model of international relations, from a 'cohesion region' to a modern 'conflict region', through the analysis of the dynamics of regional cooperation networks amidst the crisis in the international system and politics. The study builds on the tradition of historical and political analysis of regions as agents in the international relations system, drawing on relevant documents and materials from international organisations, foreign ministries and other authorities of the Baltic Sea region states. The final part of the research emphasises the need for experts to search for a post-conflict regional agenda, with some proposals outlined.

AB According to the most experts, there is a bipartisan consensus in the United States regarding China: both parties recognize that China poses an existential threat to the United States, its economy, socio-political structure and the role as a global leader. This core conceptual consent represents a clear contrast with the endless battles between Democrats and Republicans in the domestic political arena, blocking any legislative initiatives and the development of a unified sociopolitical agenda for the country. This rare unity has made many observers to claim the emergence of a new external enemy, in the face of which America will be able to overcome its identical crisis and to come back to national unity. The political elite also actively uses the image of the enemy, calling on the Nation for unity. This article is aimed to understand what lies behind political slogans and the bipartisan concept of confronting China. The study is based on the analysis of several sources that make it possible to judge the attitude towards China in the United States along party lines, specific to each level of the party-political system- party platforms at the federal level, legislative initiatives at the state and city levels, public opinion polls at the level of the society. The research hypothesis is that Democrats and Republicans, who agree on the conceptual vision of the Chinese threat, offer different ways to counter it. The difference in methods of struggle stems from different ideological and value models that manifest themselves in the implementation of both the socioeconomic agenda within the country and foreign policy strategies in the international arena. The unity of the parties ends exactly by the developing of a conceptual framework for confrontation with the opponent. The implementation of specific steps of the anti-Chinese agenda at the state and city levels is taking place in accordance with the ideological and political guidelines of each party, and the public attitude towards the Chinese threat demonstrates a clear split along party lines. The conceptual positioning of a new external enemy instead of unification brought to the United States anti-Chinese hysteria among conservative politicians at the state level, which was realized in the adoption of discriminatory laws in Republican states against Chinese citizens and a new wave of anti-Chinese sentiment in society, manifested in outbreaks of violence against Asian minorities.

AB This article analyzes the political and economic motivations behind the coordinated decision of the European Union and its member states to withdraw from the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) in March 2024. Special emphasis is placed on the role of the EU's climate policy in this process. A comprehensive review of the thirty years since the treaty's inception is presented, aiming to uncover its influence on the domestic political dynamics within EU member states. Through an examination of investment arbitration practices and official EU documents, it is concluded that, despite declarative statements, the climate agenda was merely an external and secondary factor, while the primary driver was a shift in the EU's investment policy. The article illustrates that the treaty did not obstruct the achievement of the EU's climate objectives; however, the investment protection mechanism in international arbitration proved incompatible with the principles of autonomy and primacy of EU law. Furthermore, the treaty indeed provided investors with avenues to seek compensation from EU member state governments for assets "blocked" as a result of climate policies. The abandonment of a proven international investments protection tool may negatively impact the foreign investment attractiveness of the EU's green energy sector.

AB The article is devoted to the story of the relationship between medieval Hungary and the Byzantine Empire during their tense confrontation. The source base of the study was the "Hungarian Illustrated Chronicle", the writings of Byzantine historians John Kinnamos and Niketas Choniates, as well as a narrative work by the Arab author Abu Hamid al-Gharnati. They contain information about the internal and foreign policy of Hungary and Byzantium, diplomatic contacts and military campaigns. The materials of the sources allow us to reconstruct the processes and events from the history of relations between the two states. The Hungarian Kingdom, as in the previous period, maneuvered between the interests of major political players - Byzantium, Germany, the Papacy, Italian city- states. The policy of the Norman kingdom aimed at expanding its influence on the territories previously controlled by the Byzantine Empire, as well as the struggle for the throne in Kievan Rus, in which Hungary and Byzantium supported one side or another, pursuing their own interests, became new factors of increasing political tension. Byzantium actively interfered in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Hungary, using for its own purposes the claims to the throne of Stephen IV. Each of the parties concluded dynastic marriages with representatives of other states to create military and political alliances and strengthen their positions in the international arena. The growing confrontation between Hungary and Byzantium resulted in a series of military campaigns in 1151-1156 and 1163-1167. The culmination of the confrontation, which lasted from the turn of the XI-XII centuries, was the battle in the summer of 1167 on the Sava River, the victory in which provided Byzantium with control over Sirmium, Dalmatia and Bosnia.

DT Article
DE leadership; national liberation movement,; revolutions; redefining"
   leaders,; national development,; instruments of influence
AB Leadership as a phenomenon of timeless significance has always been a subject of research interest. It is a special form of social process inherent in all social groups. In this sense, it is characterized primarily by mutual influence of the members of these groups, with one or several of them exerting a disproportionally larger influence on the choices and actions of the other parts of group. At the same time, personal qualities including leadership style and political motivation remain the central concept of political leadership theory. The emergence of new challenges and new requirements for leaders makes it necessary to consider the tools of influence they possess and employ as well as their ability to adapt to the changing internal and external environment. This article focuses on the leaders of the Arab states who came to power in different periods and represented different types of leadership. In the times of national liberation movements, these were revolutionaries, who overthrew outmoded regimes, promised their people a bright future and built it in their own way. At present, the "redefining" leaders (mostly represented by Gulf monarchs) attract the most attention. They have proved to be highly sensitive to the demands of the time, offering their own ways of responding to them. Both monarchs and republican leaders sometimes share similar cultural and historical identities that influence their methods of governance. For example, the Bedouin theme, which emphasizes the ruler's closeness to his people and his task to take care of his tribesmen, has been accentuated by the Gulf monarchs and by some revolutionary leaders. The author believes that leaders capable of "redefining" are not necessarily a product of democratic systems. In authoritarian regimes, a new generation of rulers has also contributed to the revision of a number of well-established dogmas concerning the goals of social and national development. However, methods, as well as certain management practices used in the Arab monarchies, have been shaped by a mix of elements associated both with modernity and traditionalism
