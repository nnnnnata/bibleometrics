AB This paper starts from the premise that the politicization of Europe is indicative of a new structuring conflict that involves a set of processes which put the national political community under strain. This structuring conflict has been emerging long before the Euro and refugee crises. However, these crises may have reinforced and potentially reshaped public conflicts within and across countries. Therefore, the paper traces the politicization of Europe during national election campaigns in fifteen countries from the early 2000s up to 2017. The analysis focuses on the way the multiple crises have affected the level of politicization, its driving forces, and the location of European issues in the political space. Overall, the results indicate a substantive increase in politicization, but they also point to strong region and crisis-specific varieties which should be considered in scholarly discussions on the relative impact of domestic conflicts on the future course of European integration.

AB The pandemic of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) poses substantial challenges to the health financing sustainability in high-income and low/middle income countries (LMICs). The aim of this review is to identify the bottle neck inefficiencies in NCDs attributable spending and propose sustainable health financing solutions. The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the "best buy" concept to scale up the core intervention package against NCDs targeted for LMICs. Population- and individual-based NCD best buy interventions are projected at US$170 billion over 2011-2025. Appropriately designed health financing arrangements can be powerful enablers to scale up the NCD best buys. Rapidly developing emerging nations dominate the landscape of LMICs. Their capability and willingness to invest resources for eradicating NCDs could strengthen WHO outreach efforts in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, much beyond current capacities. There has been a declining trend in international donor aid intended to cope with NCDs over the past decade. There is also a serious misalignment of these resources with the actual needs of recipient countries. Globally, the momentum towards the financing of intersectoral actions is growing, and this presents a cost-effective solution. A budget discrepancy of 10:1 in WHO and multilateral agencies remains in donor aid in favour of communicable diseases compared to NCDs. LMICs are likely to remain a bottleneck of NCDs imposed financing sustainability challenge in the long-run. Catastrophic household health expenditure from out of pocket spending on NCDs could plunge almost 150 million people into poverty worldwide. This epidemiological burden coupled with population ageing presents an exceptionally serious sustainability challenge, even among the richest countries which are members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Strategic and political leadership of WHO and multilateral agencies would likely play essential roles in the struggle that has just begun.

TI Trust and power as determinants of tax compliance across 44 nations
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Trust; Power; Slippery slope framework; Tax compliance; Tax evasion
ID EVASION; PUNISHMENT; AUDIT
AB The slippery slope framework of tax compliance emphasizes the importance of trust in authorities as a substantial determinant of tax compliance alongside traditional enforcement tools like audits and fines. Using data from an experimental scenario study in 44 nations from five continents (N = 14,509), we find that trust in authorities and power of authorities, as defined in the slippery slope framework, increase tax compliance intentions and mitigate intended tax evasion across societies that differ in economic, sociodemographic, political, and cultural backgrounds. We also show that trust and power foster compliance through different channels: trusted authorities (those perceived as benevolent and enhancing the common good) register the highest voluntary compliance, while powerful authorities (those perceived as effectively controlling evasion) register the highest enforced compliance. In contrast to some previous studies, the results suggest that trust and power are not fully complementary, as indicated by a negative interaction effect. Despite some between-country variations, trust and power are identified as important determinants of tax compliance across all nations. These findings have clear implications for authorities across the globe that need to choose best practices for tax collection.

AB This article assesses the trajectory of postsocialism as a concept and mounts a fivefold critique of postsocialism as: referring to a vanishing object; emphasising rupture over continuity; falling into a territorial trap; issuing from orientalising knowledge construction; and constraining political futures. This critique serves to sketch the contours of an alternative project that still recognises difference but foregrounds links and continuities, develops a political edge, and theorises not just about but with and from this part of the world.

AB Prejudiced attitudes and political nationalism vary widely around the world, but there has been little research on what predicts this variation. Here we examine the ecological and cultural factors underlying the worldwide distribution of prejudice. We suggest that cultures grow more prejudiced when they tighten cultural norms in response to destabilizing ecological threats. A set of seven archival analyses, surveys, and experiments (Sigma N = 3,986,402) find that nations, American states, and pre-industrial societies with tighter cultural norms show the most prejudice based on skin color, religion, nationality, and sexuality, and that tightness predicts why prejudice is often highest in areas of the world with histories of ecological threat. People's support for cultural tightness also mediates the link between perceived ecological threat and intentions to vote for nationalist politicians. Results replicate when controlling for economic development, inequality, conservatism, residential mobility, and shared cultural heritage. These findings offer a cultural evolutionary perspective on prejudice, with implications for immigration, intercultural conflict, and radicalization.

AB Spatial economics aims to explain why there are peaks and troughs in the spatial distribution of wealth and people, from the international and regional to the urban and local. The main task is to identify the microeconomic underpinnings of centripetal forces, which lead to the concentration of economic activities, and centrifugal forces, which bring about the dispersion of economic activities at the regional and urban levels. Transportation matters at both scales, but in a different way. The emphasis is on the interregional flows of goods and passenger trips at the regional level and on individual commuting at the urban level.

AB This study proposes the interventionist and the detached orientations to watchdog journalism through the conceptual lens of journalistic role performance. Based on a content analysis of 33,640 news stories from sixty-four media outlets in eighteen countries, we measure and compare both orientations across different countries using three performative aspects of monitoring: intensity of scrutiny, voice of the scrutiny, and source of the event. Our findings show that the interventionist approach of watchdog journalism is more likely to be found in democracies with traditionally partisan and opinion-oriented journalistic cultures or experiencing sociopolitical crises. In turn, the detached orientation predominates in democracies with journalistic traditions associated to objectivity. Although both orientations have a lower presence in transitional democracies, the detached watchdog prevails, while in non-democratic countries the watchdog role is almost absent. Our results also reveal that structural contexts of undemocratic political regimes and restricted press freedom are key definers of watchdog role performance overall. However, the type of political regime is actually more important-and in fact the most important predictor-for detached than for interventionist reporting.

TI Elite Defection under Autocracy: Evidence from Russia
SO AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW

DT Article
ID PARTY; ELECTIONS; AUTHORITARIANISM; PRIVATIZATION; SUBVERSION;
   DEMOCRACY; ECONOMY; MODEL
AB Elite cohesion is a fundamental pillar of authoritarian stability. High-level defections can signal weakness, embolden the opposition, and sometimes, lead to regime collapse. Using a dataset of 4,291 ruling party candidates in Russia, this paper develops and tests hypotheses about the integrity of elite coalitions under autocracy. Our theory predicts that ruling elites defect when there is greater uncertainty about the regime's willingness to provide spoils. Regimes that share power with the opposition, limit access to spoils, and lack formal institutions see more defections. Co-opting the opposition assuages outside threats but leaves regime insiders disgruntled and prone to defection. Those with personal followings and business connections are the most likely to defect, since they can pursue their political goals independently of the regime. Taken together, our results highlight important tradeoffs among authoritarian survival strategies. Many of the steps autocrats take to repel challenges simultaneously heighten the risk of defections.

ID POLITICAL TRUST; CORRUPTION
AB How do elections and postelection protest shape political trust in a competitive autocracy? Taking advantage of largely exogenous variation in the timing of a survey conducted in Moscow in 2011, we find that with few exceptions the election had little systematic effect on political trust, perhaps because vote improprieties were not new information. In contrast, the unexpected protest that followed increased trust in government. In this case, heightened trust arises largely from opposition voters-those most likely to be surprised by permission to hold the protest-who update their beliefs. We argue that when autocrats permit protest unexpectedly, citizens may update their beliefs about the trustworthiness of the government. Our results suggest that citizens may cue not off the content of a protest but off the government's decision to permit it. In addition, autocrats can increase trust in government by allowing protest when it is unexpected.

AB Geographical Indications (GIs) are increasingly important instruments of agricultural and food regulations and are growing as contentious issues in trade negotiations and disputes. GIs can improve welfare but they can also be a protectionist instrument. The EU has the most GIs in the world, but they are concentrated in the south of the EU. Even excluding wine, there are seven times more food GIs per capita in the southern EU Member States than in other EU Member States. This note discusses several factors which may explain the geographic concentration of GIs in the south of the EU.

   VIOLENCE; FREEDOM; IMPACT
AB The performed cross-national tests with negative binomial regression models support the presence of a curvilinear relationship between the quantitative expansion of education (measured with mean years of schooling) and terrorist attack intensity. Growth of schooling in the least educationally developed countries is associated with a significant tendency towards the growth of terrorist attack intensity. This tendency remains significant when controlled for income level, type of political regime, unemployment, inequality, and urbanization; wherein the peak of the terrorist attack intensity is observed for a relatively low, but not zero level of the quantitative expansion of formal education (approximately three to six years of schooling). Further growth of schooling in more developed countries is associated with a significant trend toward the decrease of terrorist attack intensity. This tendency remains significant after being controlled for income level, political regime, unemployment, inequality, and urbanization. The most radical decrease is observed for the interval between seven and eight mean years of schooling. In addition, this quantitative analysis indicates the presence of a similar curvilinear relationship between GDP per capita and terrorist attack intensity with a wide peak from $4000 to $14,000. The explanation of a curvilinear relationship between GDP per capita and terrorist activity through mean years of schooling intermediary can only be partial. The regression analysis suggests that the growth of mean years of schooling with economic development of middle and high income countries may really be one of the factors accounting for the decrease of terrorist attacks in countries with GDP per capita growth. However, this regression analysis indicates that a partial role in the explanation of negative correlation between GDP per capita and terrorist attack intensity for middle and high income countries is also played by a lower level of unemployment rate in the high income countries, as well as by a very high share of consolidated democracies and an extremely low share of factional democracies among the high income states. It is especially worth noting that after the introduction of all controls, the coefficient sign for per capita GDP changes from negative to positive, i.e., GDP growth in middle and high income countries after the introduction of controls for inequality, education, unemployment, type of regime, etc. turns out to be a factor of increase rather than decline of the intensity of terrorist activity. On the one hand, this suggests that the negative correlation between per capita GDP and the level of terrorist activity in these countries is actually explained to an extremely high degree by the fact that per capita GDP growth here tends to be accompanied by an increase in the educational level of the population, a decrease in unemployment, a reduction in inequality, a decrease in the number of factional democracies, and an increase in the number of consolidated democracies.
   On the other hand, the positive sign (with a statistically significant correlation) indicates here that if in the middle and high countries economic growth is not accompanied by an increase in economic equality and education of the population, a decrease in unemployment, a decrease in the number of unstable factional democracies, and an increase in the number of consolidated democracies (that is, if in fact all the fruits of economic growth are captured by the elites, and almost nothing gets from this growth to the commoner population), then such economic growth would tend to lead to an increase in terrorist activity (and not to its reduction).

Whichreaction takes the upper hand: a "rally around the flag," born ofgeopolitical success, or grievance over economic misfortune? Bymeans of a survey experiment, we aim to explore the mechanismsof blame and credit when a rally around the flag coincides witha major economic downturn, and we estimate the effects of theCrimean events and the economic crisis on how Russians assessthe performance of federal political institutions. Our findingssuggest that economic hardships are attributed exclusively to thegovernment and the State Duma, while it is only the president whobenefits from the rally around the flag. Moreover, the presidentreceives an additional benefit when the "patriotic unity" primingmeets the "economic hardship" priming, thereby resulting in adouble rally around the flag effect.

AB This paper examines how democratic institutions shape the nexus of natural resources and income inequality, under the hypothesis that democracy can help to alleviate the possible effects that resources may have on income inequality. Starting from a survey of the existing literature, we provide a cross-country regression analysis showing that the effect of natural resources on income inequality does indeed depend on democracy. Our results suggest that, if the level of democracy in a country is high, natural resources have the ability to lower inequality. This finding suggests several avenues for future research.

AB Available evidence indicates that there is considerable variation among autocracies in the extent to which subnational officials are rewarded for economic growth. Why is economic performance used as a criterion for appointment in some autocracies but not in others? We argue that in more competitive though still autocratic regimes, the political imperatives of maintaining an electoral machine that can win semi-competitive elections leads regime leaders to abandon cadre policies that promote economic development. Using data on turnover among high-level economic bureaucrats in Russia's 89 regions between 2001 and 2012, we find that performance-based appointments are more frequent in less competitive regions. These findings demonstrate one way that semi-competitive elections can actually undermine economic development under autocracy.

AB The European Union (EU) is considered to be a unique economic and political union that integrates most European countries. This article focuses on the cultural aspect of European integration, which has been increasingly debated over the course of deepening and widening integration and in the context of the legitimation crisis of the EU. Among the main goals of the EU is to promote certain values, which raises the question of whether it has been efficient in (or enabled) reducing cultural value gaps among the participating countries. World polity and institutional isomorphism theories suggest that cultural values may trickle down in a vertical manner from the institutions of the EU to its member states and candidates. Furthermore, hybridisation theory postulates that values diffuse horizontally through intensified interactions enabled by the EU. These two perspectives imply the possibility of cultural convergence among countries associated with the EU. By contrast, the culture clash thesis assumes that differences in cultural identity prevent value convergence across countries; growing awareness of such differences may even increase the pre-existing cultural value distances. To test these different scenarios, distances in emancipative and secular values are compared across pairs of countries using combined repeated cross-sectional data from the European Values Study and the World Values Survey gathered between 1992 and 2011. This study finds that the longer a country has been part of the EU, the more closely its values approximate those of the EU founding countries, which in turn are the most homogenous. Initial cultural distance to the founders' average values appears irrelevant to acquiring membership or candidacy status. However, new member states experienced substantial cultural convergence with old member states after 1992, as did current candidates between 2001 and 2008. Since 1992, nations not participating in the integration process have diverged substantially from EU members, essentially leading to cultural polarisation in Europe. The findings are independent of (changes in) economic disparities and suggest the importance of cultural diffusion as one of the fundamental mechanisms of cultural change. This empirical study contributes to the literature on European integration, political and sociological theories of globalisation, and cross-cultural theories of societal value change.

AB As has been demonstrated by scholars, different levels of a polity may encompass different political regimes. In this study we examine variations in regional political regimes which have developed under Russia's system of electoral authoritarianism. Comparing the results of two cycles of regional assembly elections (2008-12 and 2013-17) we analyse and compare elections results and levels of electoral contestation in both the party list (PL) and single member district (SMD) contests. This allows us to identify the range of sub-national regime variations: hegemonic authoritarian', inter-elite bargain authoritarian', clearly-competitive authoritarian', and moderately-competitive authoritarian' regions. Approximately half of the regions demonstrate stable electoral patterns across both cycles. At the same time, none of the regions go beyond the authoritarian limitations imposed by the Russian regime. The variation is explained by a combination of structural and agency factors with a prevalence of the latter.

AB We assess and compare computer science skills among final-year computer science undergraduates (seniors) in four major economic and political powers that produce approximately half of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics graduates in the world. We find that seniors in the United States substantially outperform seniors in China, India, and Russia by 0.76-0.88 SDs and score comparably with seniors in elite institutions in these countries. Seniors in elite institutions in the United States further outperform seniors in elite institutions in China, India, and Russia by similar to 0.85 SDs. The skills advantage of the United States is not because it has a large proportion of high-scoring international students. Finally, males score consistently but only moderately higher (0.16-0.41 SDs) than females within all four countries.

AB This article attempts to advance the neoclassical realist framework by elaborating on the interaction between system-level and unit-level factors in the formation of states' behavior. With an empirical focus on post-Cold War China-Russia relations, which represent the ambivalent combination of a consistently growing strategic entente and a simultaneous reluctance to form a full-fledged political-military alliance, this study establishes two major unit-level factors - differing economic models and negative historical memories - that create hurdles for alliance formation between the two countries. However, under greater systemic pressure from the US-led unipolarity, China's and Russia's state leaders have not only increased bilateral military-to-military cooperation but have begun to actively implement policies to deliberately transform, if not remove, the existing non-systemic hurdles. Therefore, the neoclassical realist framework can be understood and further tested as a dynamic interaction model in which the unit-level circumstances, while moderating the causal impact of the system, are themselves being transformed by the system via state policies, as is their impact on states' foreign policy.

LA English
DT Article
DE Elites; foreign policy attitudes; Russia's political regime; survey of
   Russian elites
AB This article analyzes the findings of the Survey of Russian Elites from the perspective of Russian elites' perceptions of their individual and group influence on Russian foreign policy. In the current Russian elite structure, state enterprise managers, executive branch officials, and military/security officers are far more influential than members of other sub-groups when it comes to foreign policy. However, the survey results show that despite being members of the elite, respondents in all sub-groups generally found their ability to influence foreign policy decisions to be quite limited. That being said, the data show that representatives of less influential elite sub-groups are more confident about their impact on the decision-making process than representatives of more influential elite sub-groups. As such, there is a gap between elite sub-groups' perception of their influence and their actual level of individual and group influence on Russian foreign policy. The article discusses various manifestations of this gap, as well as possible causes and implications.

AB The article examines a key attribute of Russian national identity national pride-as it is reflected in mass consciousness. To trace the dynamics of multiple facets of national pride and related phenomena from 1996 to 2015, we use data from five surveys. The results demonstrate a substantial growth in Russian national pride in specific country achievements and general pride in Russian citizenship over the last 20 years. This change is the result of the population's and state's need for positive social identity as well as from both real and imagined progress in the Russian economy and political influence, and it started long before the Crimea mobilization and Olympics of 2014. The structural difference in pride in various achievements persisted for the 20 years examined here, but became less distinct. Across the years examined here, Russian national pride has become more strongly related to belief in the superiority of the country and is therefore increasingly competitive.

AB Why do social scientists choose certain theoretical and methodological stances over others? Three broad explanatory models can be derived from the literature on the sociology of social sciences: (1) worldview, arguing that intellectual preferences reflect general cultural and political orientations of broad social groupings to which an individual belongs; (2) status, according to which all forms of hierarchies are reproduced in the academic field through preferences for innovative research by those occupying dominant positions and their avoidance by agents lacking resources; (3) ecological, holding that opportunity structures existing at the historical moment at which an individual enters the academic field determine the theory choice. This article analyses the adoption of globalist or localist professional ideologies, favouring an international career and global recognition over a domestic one, or vice versa, to explore the biographical antecedents of choosing one side over the other in an important disciplinary divide. In doing so, the study draws on statistical data from a community study of sociology in Leningrad/St Petersburg between 1984 and 2011. The worldview hypothesis finds the strongest support: the preference for national or international scholarship reflects more general liberal or conservative attitudes characteristic of certain milieus existing in Russian society.

It compares representations of the United States and China as Russia's Others in discourses of Vladimir Putin, major political parties, and policy experts at a time when Russian-American relations experienced a considerable downturn and relations with China surged. The method of analysis is frames coding. The article demonstrates that for most of the actors considered, the United States plays a much more important role as constitutive Other than China.

AB The article attempts to summarize and analyze cases of electing/appointing "outsiders", or people who have little or no relation to these regions, as the heads of regional administrations in post-Soviet Russia. The author identifies four different approaches to the formation of regional authorities in the order they were used: the system of appointments with elections only in certain regions, 1991-1995; direct elections, 1996 - early 2005; "granting power" to candidates proposed by the president, February 2005 May 2012; direct elections using the "municipal filter", since June 2012; compares the peculiarities and results of cadres' turnover under each approach, and reveals five heterogeneous types of "outsiders": "pure outsiders", "returnees", "adapted outsiders", "naturalized outsiders", and "federalized locals".
   The study conducted by the author shows that, contrary to the myth of nearly a full turnover of the regional authorities at the beginning of Yeltsin's era, at that time no radical change in the composition of regional leaders took place. In 1991-1995 the former regional executives were predominantly reappointed, while appointing "outsiders" was not practiced. During the period of direct election of regional leaders, "outsiders" sometimes participated in the regional electoral campaigns, but in order to succeed they had to obtain support from these or the other groups of the regional elite. The mass appointment of "outsiders" began after the transition to the system of "granting power" to candidates proposed by the president, but this practice became most widespread only in 2016-2018. It was during these years that the regional authorities experienced the toughest turnover in the entire newest Russian history.

AB An overview of the narratives on social development that have appeared in the social sciences at the turn of the millennium demonstrates that the vision of the future that emerges is blurred, and uncertainty, anxiety and insecurity are perceptions shared by the political class and the public opinion. This said, the research agenda and governance priorities are tom apart to the detriment of security, equality and social cohesion. The gap which exists in our perception of the future calls for a new approach to development issues. The author proposes a conceptual framework for promoting social change at different levels of commrmity life based on responsible development. 23 This framework has several dimensions: a moral value oriented motivation for choosing development. priorities and stimulating individual capabilities, recourse to non-material, intellectual and (where possible) renewable resources to promote this agenda, and an institutional basis for stimulating agency, engaging and empowering individuals and communities, and fostering civic political identity. Responsible development is not a universal model, nor a set of fixed goals, but a reference frame to pursue development priorities based on a strategic vision of the future and on innovative approaches to governance. These approaches may vmy to accommodate the exigencies of different societies and communities, and there can be no one option due to differences in political culture, economic development and social frameworks, but they do share common basic principles. Social dialogue on the community level and the capabilities approach which has been adopted within the framework of the Nordic model are an example of effective governance practices which fit into this framework. Responsible development is a strategic vision of the principles that can direct communities and individuals to pursue development issues and to hold responsibility for the choices they make, for the policies they promote and for their long-term effects. As such, it requires a permanent tuning of social and political institutions, consideration of changing priorities, values and identities, and feedback between the research and the education agendas, between the state, local governments, business and civil society. The social sciences are a crucial actor in this process; promoting this discourse in the public space and engaging the political class is a key priority of a responsible intellectual community.

AB Experts code latent quantities for many influential political science datasets. Although scholars are aware of the importance of accounting for variation in expert reliability when aggregating such data, they have not systematically explored either the factors affecting expert reliability or the degree to which these factors influence estimates of latent concepts. Here we provide a template for examining potential correlates of expert reliability, using coder-level data for six randomly selected variables from a cross-national panel dataset. We aggregate these data with an ordinal item response theory model that parameterizes expert reliability, and regress the resulting reliability estimates on both expert demographic characteristics and measures of their coding behavior. We find little evidence of a consistent substantial relationship between most expert characteristics and reliability, and these null results extend to potentially problematic sources of bias in estimates, such as gender. The exceptions to these results are intuitive, and provide baseline guidance for expert recruitment and retention in future expert coding projects: attentive and confident experts who have contextual knowledge tend to be more reliable. Taken as a whole, these findings reinforce arguments that item response theory models are a relatively safe method for aggregating expert-coded data.

AB The paper provides a critical assessment of Pan-institutionalism an approach which tries to explain the course of the world economic history by changes in formal economic and formal political institutions. This approach is mono-causal since for it formal institutions do not simply matter: in fact they are all that matter. The most complete and elaborated versions of Pan-institutionalism were presented in two famous books - "Violence and social order" by North, Wallis and Weingast and "Why nations fail" by Acemoglu and Robinson. Their ideas were taken by the Russian academic community as the last word in the modern economic and political sciences. The paper demonstrates methodological narrowness, conceptual inconsistency and historical inadequacy of Pan-institutionalism. In particular, it fails to provide a coherent explanation of the turning point of the world economic history - the Industrial revolution in England in the mid of XVIII century, i.e. a transition from Malthusian to Schumpeterian economic growth.

AB Currently, the concept of employment precarization is one of the most discussed topics in the field of social and labor relations. It is due to the fact that this phenomenon affects more people than unemployment and poses a threat to the provision of decent working conditions in modern economic environment, when flexible forms of employment are coming to the fore. Their use, despite many positive aspects, often leads to the destabilization of labor relations, the effects of which go far beyond the specific workplace. In this regard, the goal of our article is to study and classify the implications of employment precarization at different levels of society organization. We use general scientific methods such as critical analysis, generalization, comparison, and classification, which serve as the basis for the analysis of domestic and foreign scientific literature on the subject. The findings of our study prove that the effects of employment precarization are indeed multifaceted. At the individual level, this is manifested in the deterioration of material well-being, social security and health, and also in the uncertainty of personal/ family and professional prospects. There may be benefits in the framework of the organization, but the destabilization of labour relations poses far greater threats, such as reduced productivity, increased staff turnover, and increased costs associated with the health and safety of employees. All this can have a negative impact on the life of society as a whole, affecting the functioning of the labor market, the degree of social cohesion, the stability of the political situation, the scale of social inequality and social exclusion, and the pace of socio-economic development. The prospects for further research are to consider the implications of employment precarization, taking into account the specifics of the social and labor sphere in Russia.

AB What is the value of a family tie? Nepotism is a common feature of democratic and non-democratic systems, but our understanding of how and why family members of government officials receive preferential treatment is limited. Using administrative data on the universe of Moscow citizens to identify family links, I adopt a difference-in-differences design to estimate the labor market returns of having a relative enter the Russian government from 1999 to 2004. Employment rates and annual wages increase for individuals related to federal bureaucrats. Surprisingly, these relatives just as often find work in the private sector, over which the government has no formal control. To explain this, I demonstrate that companies strategically hire officials' family members in order to receive state contracts and preferential regulatory treatment. Governments may be willing to overlook this type of favoritism in the allocation of jobs, since even if they do not benefit directly, nepotism creates a class of individuals invested in the current power structure.

AB Today's Russia is characterized by a great diversity of moral discourses expressing institutional and individual moral concepts, which come into conflict with each other over almost all socially significant issues. This research sets out to demonstrate that the intention of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) to dominate the sphere of morality highly correlates with the attempts of Russian political powers to make the Church responsible for the moral atmosphere in the country. To this end, firstly, the article compares the ROC hierarchs' concept of morality with the Soviet and post-Soviet views and argues that, despite some obvious differences, they share much in common. Thus, morality is interpreted as something originating 'ab extra', as an act of obedience of one's will to the rules of action established by a higher authority. Secondly, the article analyses the moral discourse of recent events, which have aroused serious disagreement between the ROC and the wider public, e.g. the restitution of the ROC property, construction of new church buildings and cases of the 'insult of believers' feelings'. The author demonstrates that, in public debates, individuals tend to abandon 'traditional' morality and express moral principles arising 'ab intra' in contrast to morality imposed from 'above'.

AB The article proposes a new version of the history of the famous Byzantine political treatise De Administrando Imperio. The text of this treatise was written after 952 and before November 959 personally by Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus for his eldest son Romanus II. The emperor worked in tandem with an "Anonymous Collaborator". The text of the treatise was based on the private notes and excerpts of emperor Constantine VII and various other historical and geographical data. Such a scheme of cooperation of Constantine VII himself and a second "Anonymous Collaborator" was described in the title of Vita Basilii Imperatoris. The same mode of compiling was mentioned in Constantine VII's private letter to Theodoros the archbishop of Cyzicus. The original codex of the treatise was kept in the emperor's palatial library, where one of the readers made a few marginalia on its pages; one of them is dated to after 979. Between 1059 and 1073 a scribe Michael Roizaite made a copy of this text for Caesar John Ducas. Apparently, John Ducas needed it as a handbook for future emperors Michael VII and Constantine X, whom he taught together with Michael Psellos.

The author analyzes the Commission's and the Council's strategic documents, the Visegrad leaders' joint statements, the European political parties' election manifestos in order to identify new ideas that can bring the migration policy to a new level in accordance with modern challenges. The analysis of the programme settings shows that the EU leaders, the member states and the political parties continue thinking in traditional terms, while demonstrating unanimity in the main directions: strengthening the protection of the EU external border and outsourcing migration problems. Indeed, the author considers attempts to renationalize the migration and asylum policy as a new trend, which its supporters understand mainly as a violation of the principle of solidarity and the EU legal discipline.

DE ecosystem services; economic assessment of ecosystem services;
   definition of ecosystem services; classification of ecosystem services;
   payments for ecosystem services
AB Over the past 10 years the problems related to ecosystem services have been reflected not only in scientific developments but also in official conceptual documents of the leading international organizations, including the United Nations (UN), the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Community (EC). Ecosystem services and payments for these services have become important in the economic and political parts of these documents. This is related in many ways to the awareness of the rapid degradation of nature, which also damages human well-being and the economy. This article analyzes the existing definitions and classifications of ecosystem services by international organizations and in the scientific literature. It concludes that the term "ecosystem services" remains controversial and that there are a number of approaches to its definition. Common in these approaches is an attempt to link eco-services with benefits for human well-being. The most recognized approach is the methodology of the UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which defines ecosystem services as those benefits that people receive from ecosystems. Particular attention in this article is paid to identifying the economic value of ecosystems and their services, which is the most difficult and urgent task for economic science. Due to the latent nature of many benefits from ecoservices and their diffusion among consumers/beneficiaries, they largely serve as public goods and are seen as free. Thus their importance is greatly underestimated, which leads to their degradation. Without a solution to this problem, the transition to a new economy for humanity is impossible. It is necessary to level out the risks of over-exploitation and depletion of ecosystem services, which requires that the environmental factor is adequately taken into account when making economic decisions.
   In Russia the economics of ecosystem services has been poorly developed both in economic research and in legal and policy documents. An important step in resolving this problem should be the implementation of the Russian president's Orders to the Government of the Russian Federation (January 2017), which envisage the development of an international environmental agenda for the formation of a system of compensation (payments) for ecosystem services with Russia as an environmental donor. Such a system needs to be formed within the country to support regions with large ecosystem capital.

AB This paper analyses the determinants of national student mobility under the unified system of admission in Russia and evaluates the barriers which still limit educational mobility. It is argued that even with the Unified State Examination (USE) and the decreased transaction costs of applying to universities, student interregional national mobility is directed towards more developed regional educational markets and richer regions, but is still limited due to the financial constraints in the absence of the additional student support. Russia is an interesting case, because it consists of regions with highly variable socio-economic development and it represents local higher education markets with different levels of competition between universities, which may influence the decision to move. USE was intended to mitigate against these differences, and for political reasons under USE such differences are not considered the main barriers of access to higher education. However, this study takes into account the importance of the institutional characteristics of regions in student mobility.

AB Citizen engagement is seen as a way to address a range of societal challenges, fiscal constraints, as welt as wicked problems, and increasing public participation in political decisions could help to address low levels of trust in politicians and decreasing satisfaction with political parties. This paper examines the perceived impacts of an experiment by the Austrian People's Party which, in response to reaching a historic low in the polls, opened up its manifesto process to public participation via digital technology. Analysis of survey data from participants found that self-efficacy is positively associated with participation intensity but negatively related to satisfaction. In contrast, collective efficacy is related to positive perceptions of public participation in party politics but does not influence levels of individual participation. Future research is needed to explore the outcomes of political innovations that use digital technologies to enable public participation on voting behaviour, party membership and attitudes to representative democracy.

AB The primary elections of the United Russia party serve as a tool for party organisation and voter mobilisation. In this study, we employ United Russia's capacity to mobilise voter turnout in the 2016 primary elections as an indirect indicator of the strength of party-controlled regional political machines. Our analysis of the results of the 2016 Duma elections in 83 regions of Russia demonstrates that voter turnout in the spring 2016 party primaries of United Russia to a significant extent explains cross-regional variation in party success.

SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE world economy; foreign policy; China; USA; "trade wars"; "One Belt, One
   Road"
AB At the end of 2018 - in the first half of 2019, a trade rivalry between the People's Republic of China and the United States has been having a significant impact on China's ideological and political component, socio-economic and military development, as well as its foreign policy. The U.S. - China "trade war" has entered a new, ambiguous phase of development. On the one hand, there is an internationalization of confrontation, in which the countries of ASEAN, APEC, etc. are directly or indirectly involved. The fields of confrontation are expanding - these are not only the economy itself, but also the military-political sphere. On the other hand, on December 1, 2018, at the G20 Summit in Argentina, the leaders of the United States and China agreed on a 90-day "truce". For one part, Beijing continues to demonstrate readiness for economic compromises, for the other part, there is unacceptability of "trading" by basic ideological and political interests. On the one hand, Washington is increasing its pressure on China, criticizing it for its "unlawful" naval activity, for the ambitious plans to create modern rocket and space troops announced by Beijing in November 2018. On the other hand, Trump shows that he is ready for trade reconciliation with Beijing, but under the terms that meet American interests and "the interests of the American taxpayer and the voter". Against this background, Xi Jinping is trying to strengthen his "rear" by appointing representatives of the "young" generation to leading positions in the party and the army. The Chinese authorities are taking a series of steps to support economic development. The impact of the "trade war" on China's economic development remains moderately negative, but at the same time, the "survival potential" of the country's economy is quite strong. Coincidently, the "development potential" of China may suffer substantial losses if the United States continue to maintain a tough restrictive line - not so much on tariff topics as on the expansion of the Chinese capital into the U.S. market and China's access to a new American technology.

AB This article investigates the links between religious beliefs and capitalist mentalities-namely devoutness to Islam and hierarchic self-interest (HSI)-and violence-accepting attitudes among the young Muslim migrant population in Germany. Following a situational perspective, these links are analyzed under different individual conditions structured by (socioeconomic) precariousness and education. Based on framing approaches and concepts from socialization theory, we derive the following hypothesis: The links between religious beliefs and capitalist mentalities and the attitudinal acceptance of violence are stronger among individuals with low levels of education and a precarious economic status (compared to high education/nonprecarious status). The strongest link is expected for a negative status inconsistency (high education/precarious economic status). Structural equation models for data from a random probability sample of 350 Muslims (aged 14-32 years) in Germany indicate that attitudinal acceptance of violence among young Muslims is not predicted by devoutness to Islam but by economic precariousness and by acceptance of capitalist values of the HSI belief system.

AB The article is a summary of the results of the study of images of power and politicians carried out since 1993. This unique project provided a vast array of empirical data on the state of political consciousness of Russian society, presented in the new book "Power and Leaders in Perceptions of Russian Citizens. A quarter century of observations. (1993-2018)". In the article, which is a journal version of the Conclusion of the book, the author tries to rise above empiricism and find answers to a number of complex theoretical questions that are debated in modern political science, such as the nature and prospects of democratic transit in Russia; the problem of overcoming the value split of post-Soviet society; most important contradictions of the mass political consciousness. 25 years of participatory observations allowed the author to offer her own interpretation of the theory of political perception, test the author's methodology of analyzing political consciousness and show possible vectors for its further development.

ID TRUTH
AB The article addresses the question whether Yablo's paradox is self-referential or not. Yablo himself claimed that the paradox is free from self-reference. Priest challenged this claim by showing that a self-referential predicate must be used both in the description of paradoxical sentences and in deriving contradiction from them. Some objected to Priest. Bueno and Colyvan suggested a derivation of contradiction that allegedly makes no use of Priest's self-referential predicate. Yablo modified paradoxical sentences intending to preclude the circular reading thereof. The author examines those replies and argues that they are both erroneous, since (a) Bueno and Colyvan's derivation is incomplete, and (b) Yablo's modification of his paradox remains subject to the circular reading. He concludes that, from the formal point of view, the paradox is self-referential in the sense that there is no way to present paradoxical sentences and to derive contradiction from them without using circular devices like Priest's predicate. The author also examines Sorensen's informal argument advocating the view that Yablo's paradox is free of self-reference and Beall's informal argument in favor of the opposite view. The result is that none of these arguments achieves its goal but they jointly show that there is no definitive informal solution to the problem.

AB A shift from social media being a medium of communication to being a voice of the people is underway. Nations have experienced a fair share of the use of social media in raising the awareness on certain cankers in society - some successful and others barren. Recent social media activism moves have instigated a general uprising on the issue which has been plaguing Ghana's natural resources and health of residents of illegal small-scale mining communities. Our study analyzed approximately 11,000 tweets made between 1st March 2017 to 1st March 2018 on Twitter with the hashtag - #StopGalamseyNow. Our results reveal an insight into the reactions of Ghanaians and the level of outrage expressed which led to the raising of awareness by the media, and government acting swiftly to curb the menace. Ghana's action is a testament to the fact that social media is a potent agent in political action (keeping government on its toes) in order to bring about national growth and establishing the true meaning of democratic governance. This study presents the use of social media as a vehicle for positive activism in bringing socioeconomic development coupled with the traditional media in amplifying the cries of citizens.

Important works in the field of solving problems of cultural integration and the development of culture and education in the world at the level of intergovernmental cooperation have been created within the framework of the so-called concept of "concerts" and "concert diplomacy", including the use of advisory and mediation technologies and institutional diplomacy at the highest level in the field of culture and education, as well as in other areas. Integration creates additional dynamic capabilities for the development of enterprises in these countries, including educational organizations. The joint mutually beneficial use of which will give an integration effect, expressed in the additional economic benefits and advantages for integrating countries, the achievement of which is impossible (or less effective) without integration interaction. Differing greatly in their socio-economic and cultural-political development, the BRICS countries seriously differ from each other in their academic traditions, forms and trends (trends) in the further development of higher education. But they are united by a common main task of achieving a balance between the desire to achieve global recognition, to take a significant place in the global market of educational services and the need to preserve the national and regional culture of education.

AB The article aims to compare the conditions of migrants from Central Asia into Russia with that of migrants from the Maghreb into France. Despite many similarities in conditions (related to the experience of social exclusion), there are deep differences. The precarious legal status of the majority of Central Asian newcomers in Russia has prevented them from embarking on an effective struggle for public recognition; this is in sharp contrast with North African newcomers in France who have been engaged in such struggle since the 1980s. In addition, Islam plays different roles in the migrants' perceptions by host societies and in identification of the migrants themselves. Whereas Islam has become a marker of overarching collective identity among the Maghreb migrants' descendants, this is not the case with Central Asians in Russia, for whom Islam remains part of their individual identity, rather than the basis of social consolidation and political mobilization.

AB In connection with some assessments about the state of crisis in which modern political science finds itself, the author considers the development of one key area of the discipline - political comparative studies, including its methodological dimensions and methodological tools. In order to make a reasonable assessment of the state of this subdiscipline, the author reconsiders its methodological measurements and its methodological tools. This analysis, as undertaken in the article, of the evolution of these comparative studies shows that the current stage is characterized as 'multiparadigm pluralism', but unlike the period of the beginning of the 21st century (which was regarded as a sign of crisis for this subdiscipline), this pluralism is productive. The author does not consider the current state of comparative studies to be a state of crisis, but characterizes it as requiring substantial updating; further, they suggest considering it, rather, as a phase of 'normal science' (according to Kuhn's terms thereof). The key problem seems to be finding a methodological algorithm of comparative studies that is adequate to the post-non-classical dynamics of politics. An examination of the currently-used comparative methods shows that the key task in this area is to refine the effective algorithm for using quantitative methods, in connection with the simplified procedures for their application that have become widespread. This determines the relevance of the 'comparative' version of the Great Debates for structuring the subject field, as well as updating the methodology and methods of this subdiscipline.

DE Michel Foucault; gouvernementalite; governmentality studies; analysis of
   power relations; state; liberalism; the government of self and others;
   ethical subject; Russian Foucault; contresens in Foucault's translations
AB Gouvernementalite is a neologism that was coined by Michel Foucault in 1978, and soon followed by "governmentality" in English. It has become one of the key concepts in the social sciences. Those terms both refer to the novel perspective that Foucault arrived at to understand and analyze the phenomenon of power or, more specifically, various types of power relations typical of different cultures and political communities. Over the past several decades, that perspective has provided the methodological basis for an emerging interdisciplinary field called Governmentality Studies in the English-language social sciences. One purpose of this approach is to reassess the genealogy and specific features of modern societies and modern states without conceptualizing "power" through the "state" as traditional political philosophy has done. However, contemporary social science in Russia has largely been deprived of the opportunity to use Foucault's conceptual instruments and research methods because of problems with translation among other barriers.
   The article 1) summarizes the Foucauldian critique and analysis of power embedded in the concept of gouvernementalite and compares that approach with traditional paradigms in political philosophy, 2) highlights how that concept has been used over the years in Foucault's works dealing with power relations and the topic of the ethical subject, 3) demonstrates that current Russian translations of Foucault's primary texts incorporating the term gouvernementalite are not merely imprecise, but exemplify what the French call contresens- interpretations that directly contradict the essence of the original. As a corpus, the available translations do not convey Foucault's thought, but rather bar Russian-speaking readers from his conceptual and exploratory perspective.

The rural settlements of the mountainous areas in the republics of the North Caucasus Federal District could not fit into market relations and lose their socio-economic purpose catastrophically in the sphere of agrarian relation organization and implementation, which threatens with unpredictable consequences not only for the socioeconomic, but also for the political sphere.

DT Article
DE Arms control; nuclear weapons; limited nuclear war concepts; nuclear
   escalation; strategic conventional arms; dual purpose systems;
   hypersonic weapons; space arms; cyber warfare; remote control systems
AB Against the background of the comprehensive crisis of the nuclear arms control treaties three new principle schools of strategic thinking have emerged and are affecting the governments of the great powers. One of them is "neo-hawks", who are claiming that disarmament agreements are detrimental by hindering the development of new nuclear arms, which have once again become an effective tool of policy and war after deep reductions during the last thirty years. These experts advocate new programs of nuclear, conventional, and dual purpose weapon systems and elaborate strategic concepts of limited nuclear warfare, controlled escalation, and victory in a nuclear war. Another school - "idealists" who call for ending with nuclear weapons by a single grand treaty of the kind they managed to promote in the UN in 2017 - the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The third school is "revisionists" who argue that nuclear multipolarity, proliferation and new military technologies (hypersonic missiles, cyber warfare, long-range armed drones, space weapons, etc.) have made traditional arms control outdated. They propose to revise the notions of parity and strategic stability, the practice of nuclear arms reductions and limitations, numerical ceilings and meticulous verification procedures. As a replacement they promote the idea of various multilateral dialogues with the goal of enhancing mutual nuclear deterrence, predictability, and trust among nations. A closer scrutiny demonstrates extreme danger of the first type of thinking which is leading to a nuclear war. The second school's idea, for all good intentions of its authors, is impossible to implement. It mistakenly treats nuclear disarmament as a technical issue, while it is an extremely complex political and strategic problem. The third group may do still more harm by persuading state leaders and public opinion that the collapse of the arms control is not dangerous: allegedly it is possible to enhance security without long and exhausting negotiations and complex agreements. In contrast to the above ideas, provided political will of the leaderships of the major nations, it is still possible to save or revive some important treaties and move forward addressing many novel weapons and technologies by aims control talks. Dynamic changes of the world order, military hard- and software, and strategic thinking - all these are making arms control more vital for the Russian and international security than ever before.

AB The cyclical character of the formation and development of confessional spaces as affected by competition between religions has been established. As a result of a weakening monopoly and growth of religious competition, a once prevailing religion is gradually ousted either by another religion (the R-cycle of religious competition) or-which has become a distinctive feature of the 19th-21st centuries-by secular ideologies (in the case of social secularization, the S-cycle; political secularization, the SP-cycle). In addition, considerably long intercyclic stages of religious saturation have been identified. The common property of the three types of cycles is their aperiodicity. Characteristic of R- and SP-cycles are also intermittence, reversibility, and the ability to develop in parallel to one another and to R-cycles. The territorial expansion of the cycles is wavelike but is differentiated within the structure of the confessional space: R-cycles are confined to countries and their administrative territorial units, and SP-cycles, to the world's macroregions. Note that the S-cycles have no limitations.

AB The article offers an analysis of historical politics and political use of the "historical statehood" concept in the unrecognized republics of Transnistria and Donbass. It traces the use of the"historical statehood" by the Transnistrian and Donbass separatist leaders for legitimizing their cause, in their political struggle and expansionist pursuits, and in the appeals to the population of territories under the control of the central governments. A specific strategy of self-legitimization and self-representation, emphasizing multiethnicity and declarative rejection of ethnic nationalism, influences the way these separatist regimes employ historical politics and instrumentalize their "historical statehood." I suggest naming this approach "internationalist separatism."

   investment; global competitiveness; digital economy; global economic
   governance; protectionism; trade wars
AB After the crisis of 2008-2009, dynamics and structural characteristics of the global economy experienced profound changes. Instead of shifting to a 'New Normal' of any kind, it presented both developed and developing economies with a set of strategic options involving technological, institutional, and economic policy trade-offs. Most resource-and technology-related 'forks in the road' are relatively growth-friendly, as the choice among the available strategic alternatives can rely on efficiency-maximizing economic calculus (although in some cases, as with the labor-saving technological change, social costs can be rather sensitive). This applies also to the dynamics of institutional change, with different economic and social institutions having proved their compatibility with positive GDP growth. On the contrary, economic policy trade-offs are much more challenging, as efficiency-improving policy reforms often bring opposition by vested interests and/or electoral risks. As for global economic governance, these risks are complemented with nationalist temptations inviting political decision makers to sacrifice global norms for country-specific benefits. In this sense, recent trends in global trade are especially warning, as proliferation of trade barriers can further reduce growth in global trade and downgrade the role of export demand as the engine of global development. Thus far, both markets and most experts considered new US protectionist initiatives as elements of the bargaining strategy used by the Trump administration, which will more likely result in concessions by the affected country partners rather than in retaliatory measures. However, the scenario of full-fledged trade wars should not be ruled out. The history of the global economy presents numerous cases when political ambitions and conflicting trading interests generate outcomes leaving all the parties worse off. Preventing the collapse of the existing regimes and institutions of global economic governance appears one of the key factors responsible for keeping growth rates of global GDP above 3 per cent in short-and medium-run perspective.

AB This article examines one aspect of the life of the evangelical communities of the USSR (Baptists and Pentecostals) which found themselves gathered into a single prayer space, as a result of state religious policy that aimed to neutralize and unify them. The authors explore the internal history of this association. Forced to unite under pressure from the Stalinist regime (indeed, Pentecostals were declared an unacceptable movement by the authorities and experienced particular discrimination), the leaders of both denominations hoped, as a result of the August Accord of 1945, to receive certain benefits: the Baptists aimed to neutralize the Pentecostals' proselytizing, while the Pentecostals hoped for convenient opportunities to preach at Baptist gatherings. Within congregations, the "victims" of political repressions and discrimination on the part of the leadership of the All-Union Council of Evangelical Christians-Baptists could be perceived as either "wolves in sheep's clothing" who stole "Baptist sheep," or as true "spiritual Christians." Drawing on oral histories and archival documents, including unique evidence for popular religion in the postwar period such as letters and memoirs, the authors analyze the argumentation of "ordinary" believers who encountered the ecstatic practices of the Pentecostals, which either frightened or delighted them, and their consequent behavioural strategies.

AB The world is sleepwalking to a fundamentally new stage in the state of international security life in a nuclear and other arms race without any restrictions, rules and exchange of military information. The denunciation of the Treaty on the elimination of intermediate-range missiles (INF) is almost inevitable; START III Is likely to expire in 2021 without extension; and the next review conference of the Treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons (NPT) in 2020 is almost doomed to failure. However, the important experience of the past half-century is that the renunciation of treaties in this area has never enhanced the security of States, but has always weakened it. During the same time, the history of the arms race has given many examples of how the primacy in the creation of new weapons subsequently turned out to be a loss, not a gain, for the security of one side or another The most important lesson is that nuclear deterrence can be a guarantee of peace only when combined with the maintenance and expansion of the nuclear anus control system and regimes. Today, the first priority is to save the INF Treaty, which is still possible. Then the agreement on the extension of the START Treaty after 2021 or the urgent start of negotiations on the follow-on strategic treaty. After that, measures to strengthen the NPT. Only consistent disarmament steps in parallel with positive changes in the international political and strategic environment can enhance universal security in the coming century.

DE Lamansky; history of the Slavic studies; Saint Petersburg University;

AB On the basis of the archival sources and memoirs of the contemporaries, the authors of the article reconstruct the university career of an outstanding Russian Slavic scholar V. I. Lamansky (1833-1914): from the period when he served as an officer in the administration of St. Petersburg Governorate to the time when he made a decision to resign from the university in protest against the government's actions during the 1899 student unrest. It is noted that the foundations of Lamansky's scholarly methodology was formed by Slavophile philosophy, since we can consider Lamansky the representative of the movement of so called academic Slavophilism. Lamansky' orientation towards philosophical approach with regard to Slavic history and culture enabled him to become a founder of an independent historiographical school, with which a number of renowned Russian scholars can be associated. The authors underline that Lamansky realized himself more as a political thinker and philosopher of history than a researcher; however, this fact did not prevent him from contributing to Russian Slavic studies as an independent discipline with its own subject and method. Exploring Lamansky's correspondence, the authors analyze Lamansky's perception of 1884 University regulations and 1899 student unrest. It enables to demonstrate the specificity of Lamansky's political views and some features of his personality. Therefore, contrary to the accepted viewpoint, prevalent in historiography since the Soviet period, according to which Lamansky was inclined to political conservatism and reactionary movement, we can argue that Lamansky's political position was of liberal nature.

AB Media is one of the most important social institutions that mediates the attitude of citizens to other institutions of society. Thus, one of the key features of the contemporary society is the trust of citizens in basic social institutions. The article considers the issue of public trust in the Russian media and focuses on the question to what extent the trust of Russian citizens in the mass media depends on the trust in other state and public institutions. The authors' conclusions are based on the comparative empirical studies in the metropolitan region conducted in 2016-2018. The data show that people do not really trust in media: about a half of respondents do not trust this institution. This is a common trend for the post-Soviet period in general. The authors used binary logistic regression, and found out that distrust in media is significantly correlated with distrust in other institutions such as the president, State Duma, law enforcement agencies, political parties, church, banks and businesses. Moreover, according to the statistical model, the lack of trust in media is determined by social-economic problems, general dissatisfaction with political system, and negative attitudes to media content and its role in the society. When studying trust in media one should take into account the ongoing transformations of media landscape: today the most trusted media are Internet and television (practically the same level of trust). There is also a clear age differentiation: trust in media generally grows with age, although the situation is opposite considering trust in the Internet. The development of media technologies and online services and networks makes it increasingly difficult to assess the level of public trust in media and other institutions.

AB The article presents the results of a study of Russia's the perception by its citizens, implemented at the Chair of Sociology and Psychology of Politics, Faculty of Political Science, Moscow State University. The research was devoted to the Russia's in the minds of residents of different regions. The research technique of the study included methods of semi-structured interviews and projective tests. To interpret the data, the authors used both qualitative and quantitative methods, in particular, coding and scaling of answers to open-ended questions and statistical analysis. The article presents the results of a comparative analysis of images of their country among residents of 11 regions of Russia. This analysis is also complemented by 3 case-studies from Moscow, Smolensk and the Tyva Republic. The image of the country in the minds of Russians was tackled on two levels of perception: rational and unconscious. Authors focuse of the most important structural elements of the image: territory, people, authorities, leaders and the geopolitical role of the country. The study made it possible to interpret the peculiarities of Russia's perception in regions by different federal status. The conclusions highlight the problem of the formation in Russia of nation-state identity and the construction of consistent images of the past and the future, in which images of the country should find their place. The basis for the formation of a congruent image of the country is seen, above all, in moral determinants, which have not only high, but priority importance in political perception of their country.

AB The issues related to the transformation of Slavic languages at the turn of the 20th - 21st centuries are considered. Special attention is paid to the tendencies of enrichment of Bulgarian and Russian languages with phraseological units. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that for the first time a comparative analysis of dictionaries containing phraseological neologisms is made. The results of a comparison of the sources of phraseological units and their areas of functioning are presented. The author proceeds from the fact that the enrichment of phraseology is subject to two trends - borrowing and updating at the expense of its own reserves. It is established that borrowed phraseological units are represented by calques, semi-calques and units that preserve the original sound appearance. It is emphasized that they function in technical, political, financial, military, sport and other spheres of communication. The author dwells on the differences between Bulgarian and Russian neologisms: Bulgarians have mainly folk and folklore units; Russians have many expressions from synthetic genres of art. The higher productivity of such "suppliers" of neologisms as international political discourse, military and slang spheres in the Russian language, and financial and economic sphere in the Bulgarian language is proved. The relevance of the study is proved by the need to create the Russian-Bulgarian and Bulgarian-Russian dictionaries of phraseological neologisms.

DE social bots; political communication; manipulation; public opinion;
   electoral practices; methods for revealing bots
AB In political communication, social bots are a new phenomenon of using automated algorithms that imitate behavior of real political agents in online social networks. The article presents a review of foreign and Russian approaches to the study of social bots. The authors identify three main thematic fields in the study of social bots: 1) types of social bots, 2) the use of bots in election campaigns, and 3) methods to detect bots. The article considers different types of social bots and concludes that in the political communication social bots' typologies are based mainly on characteristics of their use (goals, functions, ways), which is determined by the aims of political agents that control social bots. The authors identify six key areas of using bots in the political communication: soft information wars; propaganda of pro-government position; astroturfing as a technology to create artificial public opinion; changing public opinion by constructing agents of influence or false public opinion leaders; delegitimization of government systems, support of opposition forces and civil society actors; setting agenda and political debates. The authors summarize the results of the analysis of bots' usage in election campaigns (in the USA, Great Britain, Venezuela, Japan and other countries) and identify three main communication strategies based on bot-campaigns: 1) attracting supporters, 2) constructing a positive politician's image, and 3) discrediting a political opponent. The comparative analysis of bots' detection mechanisms showed that researchers use the same automated algorithms based on static and behavior characteristics but in different combinations. As bot accounts get more sophisticated and complex, the mixed method approach combining programming and social science methods will be developing too.

AB Under the system of presidential appointments of regional governors, which existed in Russia from 2005 to 2012, gubernatorial loyalty to the central government and particularly governors' ability to deliver satisfactory results to the ruling party in national-level elections were crucial to their likelihood of being reappointed to the next term. In this paper, we argue that governors, anticipating the relationship between loyalty and reappointments, attempted to deliver additional votes to the ruling party, and show that those attempts were subject to regional political cycles. Exploiting variation in the starting and expiry dates of Russian regional governors' terms of office, we find that the winning margins for a pro-government party across Russian regions in national-level elections held between 2007 and 2012 were substantially higher when elections were closer to the beginning or to the expiration of a regional governor's term. The effect is driven almost exclusively by the governors serving their first terms. However, for elections held between 1999 and 2004, when governors were subject to direct votes by regional constituencies, no similar effect is found. The results can be explained by, e.g., first impression and recency biases in appointment decisions. We then implement several exercises to identify the sources of the additional votes for the ruling party and demonstrate that governors, while unlikely committing electoral fraud, likely exerted effort to stimulate turnout among ruling party supporters.

AB Theories and concepts developed and empirically tested in the context of North American and Western European countries do not always easily transfer to another political landscape. The concept of "policy advisory system" is not an exception. On the one hand, policy processes and policy styles are not unique for each country; therefore, some generalizations can be made. On the other hand, studding particularities of policy process in a specific country can enrich theories, developed for general cases. Applying existing theories to a new context also goes a long way in verification and potential falsification - the fundamental requirement for a scientific process. This article aims to contribute to the debate on the topic of policy advisory system by comparing the development of three policies in Russia, each involving policy advisors to some extent. Based on this analysis, lessons are drawn regarding the conditions under which policy advisors can impact policy changes in an environment, alternative to "western."

   United States; China; international competition; growth strategy
AB The so-called "golden decade" (2003-2013) in Latin America, marked by relatively high GDP growth, a build-up of foreign trade volume, expanding domestic market and rising living standards, rapidly became history thanks to years of recession, sluggish growth and deterioration of economic conditions for the majority of the population. After the failures of neo-liberal experiments of 1990s, the populist projects that established the matrix of social development in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Ecuador and other countries of the region in the first decade of the 21st century also failed. Those who ruled these regimes demonstrated incompetence which caused an economic stupor and a serious social trauma to people of the Latin American republics. To these negative phenomena there should be added the domestic political turmoil, particularly, loud corruption scandals and the removal of acting heads of State from power, as well as increased foreign competition in the region. In addition, on the outer perimeter, the complexity of the situation is compounded by the fact that Latin America (with a few exceptions confirming the rule) has not been able to receive a maximum dividend from the globalization process, as China, India, the Republic of Korea, South-East Asia and some European States did, but fully suffered the shock of external effects: drops of prices on world commodity and food markets, financial disasters, consequences of "trade wars". For nearly two decades, Latin America has been living under conditions of structural crisis of varying intensity, the essence of which is characterized not only by strong fluctuations in the rate of GDP growth and sharp changes on commodity and financial markets, but also by a deep transformation that has engulfed the economy, politics, social sphere and the scope of external relations of the regional countries. However, the process of these changes is not of a steady character, is marked by bends and intermittent periods of stagnation, weakening the region's position in the global economy. In an e f fort to reverse this situation and take the path of steady growth, the search for opportunities to give an impetus to the socio-economic development has intensified in Latin America.

TI PERSPECTIVE DIRECTIONS OF PATRIOTIC EDUCATION

   military-patriotic education; identity; forms and methods of work;
   citizenship; media education; perspective directions
AB Introduction. Nowadays, patriotic education is a strategic reference point of the Russian education system. However, in the modern sociocultural situation, characterised by diversity, discrepancy, multi-vector nature of development of society and polystylicity of culture, it is necessary to revise the forms of patriotic education in order to adjust them in accordance with the requirements and mental features of new young generation - so-called generation Z, which is considerably different from the previous generation of peers.
   The aims of the research were the following: to identify promising areas and vectors of patriotic education, to demonstrate its resources and to highlight the most relevant means and possibilities, which are appropriate to present-day realities.
   Methodology and research methods. The work was based on the method of discursive analysis, which allows the dependence of patriotic education practices on modern realities and socio-psychological characteristics of adolescents and youth to be revealed. In the course of the research, the methods of comparative analysis, systematisation and classification were employed.
   Results and scientific novelty. The conceptual and category-based framework of patriotic education and its structure are specified. Patriotism is considered as the most important component of the value-normative system of a personality. Patriotism is based on a positive cultural identity. Patriotism is distinguished by an active character-readiness and ability of a person to transform his or her feelings towards homeland into deeds and acts, which are necessary for the good of the country.
   The analysis of practices of patriotic education in different countries allowed the authors to allocate two basic directions - civil-patriotic and military-patriotic education, which act as the complementary components of integral system.
   Civil-patriotic education is a purposeful, consciously carried out pedagogical process of organisation and management of learners' activities for mastering socio-cultural, socio-political, economic, moral and ethical experience of democratic relations through media education and participation in socially approved projects, civil-law campaigns and charitable events, which foster tolerance for various categories of fellow citizens. Military-patriotic education implies the formation of necessary qualities and skills for performance of a military duty in ranks of the Russian Federation's Armed Forces and, furthermore, for understanding and awareness of the personal role and place in service to the Fatherland. This direction involves education towards military traditions, museum pedagogics, participation in historical reconstructions and specially designed computer games related to military-patriotic issues.
   The list of educational practices, outlined in the present publication, does not purport to be complete and exhaustive. The task of authors consisted in the search for and choice of those, which, on the one hand, fill an ideological construct "patriotism" with live contents, attract teenagers and youth, and, on the other hand, answer the requests of society for education of a socially responsible personality with sustainable value system.
   Practical significance of the research is determined by the appropriateness and efficiency of applying the described forms and methods of educational work into teaching practice.

AB Integration processes as the highest level of integration, in the formation of a common security and defense policy, have traditionally been - and remain to this day - the most difficult area of life of the EU. Firstly, it has always been especially difficult for EU member states to sacrifice a part of their sovereignty in the field of foreign policy and security. Secondly, the existing disagreements in the European Union on these issues have reflected the dichotomy of the EU member states that are trying to reconcile traditional atlantism with the security interests of the EU. The article analyzes the evolution of the military component of European integration at the current moment both in the context of international political changes in the field of global and regional security, and through new imperatives for the EU to gain strategic autonomy. In particular, special attention is paid to objective deep-seated changes in transatlantic relations after the end of bipolarity, primarily the crisis of allied relations in NATO, which in modern conditions inevitably leads to a structural demarcation of allies. The article proves that the European Union's adoption of the Global Security Strategy (GSS), and subsequent EU initiatives in the development of the GSS, opened a new period in the formation of the military autonomy of the Union.

AB Interstate military alliances have long been in the lens of theoretical and empirical research of international relations scholars. The classical view of alliances treated them as a tool for balancing amongst roughly equal players in a multi-polar anarchical environment. Meanwhile, the practice of international relations at least from the second half of the 20th century testifies to the rise of asymmetrical alliances as a new major type of military-political institutions. In such formations, a hegemon, characterized by an overwhelming preponderance in terms of its aggregate material (primarily military) capability cooperates with one or several largely inferior players from the standpoint of their comprehensive power. Traditional balancing theories are not in a position to satisfactorily account for the motivation and dynamics of the parties' behavior in alliances of this type. In the present study, based on an analysis of voting data in the UN GA and on the record of supporting U.S. actions against both Iraq in 2003 and ISIS in 2014-2017, the authors offer their theoretical explanation of the logic of participants' conduct in asymmetric alliances. They hypothesize and evidence that in exchange for military security guarantees, small and middle countries provide legitimization of unpopular foreign policy actions of the hegemon. The exchange of different types of goods represent the second type of asymmetry in the studied institutions. There is also a third dimension to it: whereas commitments of major powers are formally recognized in alliance establishing agreements, political obligations of its weaker partners remain mostly informal. However, this lack of legal expression of the allegiance to the hegemon could, the authors argue, turn out in the latter's own interests, as it increases the legitimating effect of support from the allies. In addition, a side effect of building a global client network of junior partners is the cementation of hierarchic structures under the patronage of the United States. The latter is an attempt by Washington to limit and ultimately transcend both the anarchic nature of the international environment and the ensuing low predictability of the global security environment,

AB The following paper aims to engage recent reconsiderations of Gibson's theory of affordances and Goffman's concept of copresence in the context of the material turn - especially in the form expressed by Bruno Latour's actor-network theory. The paper's central claim is that microsociology cannot avoid engaging material turn theory. It will be argued that contemporary attempts to reconceptualize classical microsociological frameworks set out on a path that invariably leads to problems investigated by thinkers like Latour: as communication technology advances, the importance of mediated interaction grows, prompting attempts to update interactionism for non-face-to-face interactions such as teleconferencing, social networks and virtual reality. These new social situations are then made sense of in terms of the way these technologies have a transformative effect on interaction. This effect be it a modifier of the temporal structure of the interaction, or of the interactional capacity of the agents is argued to always lead back to a central question of the material turn: if technology is a static transformational effect, where is its agency? Or, conversely: if a technological object's effect is uniform across all external factors, how is that not a form of technological determinism? The paper investigates whether attempts to avoid determinism manage to keep Latourian metaphysics at bay. The paper concludes by suggesting that contemporary social theory must work towards a middle way that does not gloss over important contributions of material turn theorists whilst also not ignoring the importance of considering human political responsibility.

AB The article analyzes drawbacks of the methodology behind the project "Manifesto", which make it reveal the structure of party documents over issue dimensions and political cleavages. These drawbacks are: its emphasis on issue salience instead of parties' issue positions; bringing the content of party manifestos under broad categories formulated at the beginning of the project and little adapted to situations in non-Western countries; a somewhat inappropriate technique for factor analysis. An alternative methodology is proposed that shifts the focus to parties' positions on issues which cause the biggest polarization. It also expands the range of studied documents at the expense of interviews and transcripts of debates, limits the study to a single election campaign, and makes adjustments to the procedure of factor analysis. As a result, it allows identification of the structure of issue dimensions, not of manifestos. In order to reveal political cleavages inside these dimensions, starting from so called electoral cleavages is proposed; these are detected by a factor analysis of the vote shares received by parties in different territorial units. Factor loadings of parties in the electoral space are compared through correlation analysis with their factor loadings in the political space; for more accurate results parties' issue positions in separate issue domains are analyzed. The proposed methodology is applied to the analysis of the elections to the Russian State Duma (2016) and German Bundestag (2017). It revealed that the Russian political space is structured by three conflict dimensions: systemic, authoritarian-democratic, and socioeconomic; the German one, however, is structured by only two: systemic (GAL/TAN with dominance of the transnational cleavage) and socioeconomic. With all this, the electoral space of Russia is dominated by the authoritarian-democratic cleavage, whereas the second electoral cleavage has a combined nature (socioeconomic + systemic). In Germany, the first electoral cleavage is systemic while the second one is socioeconomic.

AB The article deals with the reflection of the Polish problem in the pages of the journal "Bulletin of South-Western and Western Russia," which enjoyed a reputation as an odious and radical propaganda edition. The main attention is paid to the history of the magazine in 1862-1864 - the first years of its release before the editorial office moved from Kiev to Vilna, coinciding with the aggravation of the Polish problem on the eve and during the January uprising of 1863. The author dwells on the polemic articles that belonged to the editor K. Govorsky, publicists A. Voronin, I. Kulzhinsky, S. P. Shipov and other, often anonymous, employees of the journal. The relevance of the study is due, among other things, to the appeal to the polemics of "Bulletin" with F. Dukhinsky's ideas about "the Moscow Turanism" experiencing a second birth in some Eastern European countries. It is shown that, with rare exceptions, polemic attacks of the journal were directed not against the Polish nation, but against the "Polish" class model of social order, which was proclaimed archaism to be eliminated on the pages of "Bulletin." It is proved that the journalism of "Bulletin of South-Western and Western Russia" was not so much nationalist, but anti-class one. It is indicated that, not being a standard of good taste and conceptual novelty, it was a part of the confrontation between the two branches of Russian political culture: national and class directions.

The so-called "hypermodernism" turned out to be one of the most demanded versions of post-postmodernism. Using historical and philosophical methodology, critical analysis, contextualism, as well as the methodology of contemporary social theory and theory of culture, the author identifies the goal of the paper in determining whether the social theory of hypermodernism can be an adequate alternative to postmodernism. To accomplish this goal the author considers three versions of hypermodernism in the order of their chronological appearance, conducts a comparative analysis of each of them (since "hypermodernism" was understood in different ways at different times) and, finally, critically examines the most popular concept of hypermodernism. The first version of hypermodernism was proposed by two Canadian political theorists, Arthur Kroker and David Cook, who understood it as an alternative to postmodernism in the mid-1980's. Under the influence of the ideas of Jean Baudrillard, they focused their attention on the transformations of aesthetics in the new era (hyper-aesthetics of "excrements" against anti-aesthetics of postmodern). Later Arthur Kroker and Marilouise Kroker used the term "hypermodernism" in the context of "Theses on the Disappearing Body in the Hyper-Modern Condition". The second version proposed by a British media theorist John Armitage attempted to describe the "dromology" of the French social philosopher Paul Virilio as "hypermodernistic". However, neither the first nor the second concept of hypermodernism became popular. The third and most popular version of the "time of hypermodern" (hyperindividualism and hyperconsumerism) was the theory of the French social philosopher Gilles Lipovetsky. His understanding of hypermodernism is developed today by a number of sociologists in France and even in the English-speaking world. However, even this version of hyper - modernims did not gain a wide enough influence. The author concludes that hypermodernism is a "weak alternative" to postmodernism.

DT Article
DE civic participation; democracy; activity; authority; civil society;
   institutional confidence
AB The author argues that the rise of civic activism and formation of the public demand for social change convert the problem of the prospects of the Russia's democracy into another context, than it had been a few years ago. The change of vector of public moods and expectations as it is stated in the article coincides with the emergence of multiple social groups and strata that do not need any goverment care and are interested to expand the borders of freedom and individual self-realization. These both factors open a window of opportunity for the development of diverse forms and practices of civic participation. The author interprets the above concept as a way that citizens and either formalized or not formalized social associations are expressing self-manifestation in different social spheres. The problem of interaction and co-influence between such two key components of civic participation as the political and social ones is the central problem of the article. The author argues that the convergence between the political and social components of civic participation should occur (and to some extent it is already going on) through both the politicization of socially oriented public associations and the socialization of political parties and movements. The author applies sociological data collected by Federal Center of Theoretical and Applied Sociology of Russian Academy of Sciences that demonstrate that the level of direct involvement of Russia's citizens into various forms of political and social participation is low. Wherein there is a rather significant segment of the activist periphery that under certain circumstances is promising for more intense involvement. It is emphasized that the increased importance of civic participation in contemporary Russia is determined not so much by its mass character as by ability of the active part of society to form institutional matrix of new forms and practices for political representation and public participation. This process is intensifying under the influence of confidence crisis both to existing power and government system and to most institutions of representative democracy.

AB YWhy, and under what conditions, are regimes formed where, in one case, the focus is on the dominance of one actor, capable of changing the "rules of the game", whilst in another, the possibilities of political actors are limited? The study is aimed at studying power groups in the urban community, considered within the framework of the concept of urban political regimes, which are a composite of formal and informal norms of interaction that develop between actors having access to institutionalized resources and forming a coalition for management of community. Initially, the focus was on the formation of a regime in a large industrial center, where a monopoly on power and personality were the main characteristics. Next, the hypothesis was formulated about the external (scale of the city, the projection of business interests and the specialization of enterprises) and internal (leadership strategy) factors in the formation of various regimes. The method of testing the hypothesis is a comparison of opposite cases: the regime in the industrial center was compared with the regime of the Siberian megalopolis. Further comparison was carried out in two areas of the same city with opposite socio-economic characteristics with the subsequent analysis of power in Siberian cities. A common characteristic of urban regimes is the limitations and motivation of participants. The independence of the actors depends on the requirements of the federal (in both cases) and regional (to a lesser extent for the metropolis) centers. The system of existing informal rules largely coincides with the characteristics of the "political machine" and is based on the personal interests of the coalition participants, and not on the dominance of political principles and ideologies. The differences in the strategies of the actors are the following: traditional leadership with an explicit program, concentration of resources, and an invasion of coalition members for the realization of declared goals in monopolistic, personified regions, and in "polyarchic" regions "sustainable action", built on maximum secret and uncertainty of the goals of leadership and conclusion of a lot of alliances with different forces.

AB The paper deals with the critical analysis of the narrative and ideational "turns" in economic research. Based on the research findings of information science, social psychology, decision-making theory, cognitive science, anthropology, and other fields of research, the author shows that perspectives on "the power of ideas" and its impact for economic policy are greatly exaggerated. First and foremost, the scholars ignore the fact that only ideas that respond to the concerns of economic and political actors are accepted by them and transform into their beliefs. Further, to put belief into action, the actor must have the appropriate resource capacity including sufficient level of self-efficacy, as well as the internal locus of control. Finally, the actor must have appropriate incentives for action: his expected benefits ought to exceed the expected costs. For all these reasons, neither the spread of a new idea is synonymous with its acceptance, (transformation into belief), nor it is identical to the implementation of the ideas. Narratives represent the meaningful unit of content. Being similar to the structure of a decision-making situation, the narrative structure mirrors causal connections between actions and their effects. Human brain is evolutionary wired for narratives, so narrative communication has high persuasion capacity regardless of is content. This does not mean that narrative research in economy is not an important field. Narratives are part of economic culture; thus, narrative research could help reveal wrong decisions regarding economic policies.

ID HISTORY
AB The article focuses on little-known pages of the northern frontier history - the Russian-Norwegian borderlands, specifically the description of the ethnic and cultural space of the Eastern, Orthodox Sami (Skolts) group in the XVIII century. Through the wide range of sources, from the Russian and Norwegian archives, the authors reconstruct the boundaries of the territorial possessions of Sami groups, and the demographics of the Skolts' pogosts. The authors explain that the status position of the village headman, as the administrative and political leader of the pogost among the skolts from the 18th century was growing. The headman served as the executive and judicial authorities of the pogost, which was encouraged by the Russian county administration. Economic activities of the Skolts could be wider than the administrative borders of the Siyits and vice versa. In this regard, the described boundaries of the pogosts in Norwegian and Russian sources is only a representation of local and regional authorities on the presence of fixed administrative and economic boundaries of collectives. This difference is due to the asymmetry in the perception of space by the semi-nomadic Sami population of the borderland and the Russian administration. The reconstruction of the demographics of the skolts demonstrates that during the XVIIIth century, there was a constant decrease in the population with the reduction of the fishing capacity, the elasticity of the economic borders and the gradual settlement of the skolts' territories by the Norwegian Sami.

AB The article examines the criticism of relativism in modern epistemology in comparison with studies on logic and the philosophy of mathematics. Frederic Fitch's idea to limit the use of Bertrand Russell's theory of types is discussed. The author of the article claims that Fitch's idea relates to the problems of the philosophy of mathematics, but it cannot be applied in the field of epistemology. The results of Carl Kordig's studies are critically evaluated. In order to demonstrate the inconsistency of relativism in modern epistemology Kordig tries to rely on Fitch's works on the philosophy of mathematics. The inconsistency of some modern relativistic concepts using the reductio ad absurdum argument based on the self-reference phenomenon is shown. Fitch's idea of limiting Russell's theory of types was to apply this theory to self-referential reasonings that lead to paradoxes but not to apply it to other reasonings containing self-referentiality. This idea may well be used in the field of the philosophy of mathematics. However, difficulties arise when we try to transfer this idea from the field of the philosophy of mathematics to epistemology. If we continue to apply Russell's theory of types in relation to paradoxical self-referential reasoning, then this theory will justify the relativistic type of thinking. The author of the article claims that if we want to criticize relativism using the reductio ad absurdum argument based on the phenomenon of self-referentiality, as Kordig does, then we must completely abandon Russell's theory of types.

AB The article considers a topical issue of political socialization of youth. Protest moods, mass demonstrations and specific actions show that currently, in many countries, young people are becoming more active and focused on "criticism by action" of traditional political institutions. On the other hand, these institutions lose youth support in the elections and in the party building process. Classical ideologies and the ideology as a form of mind control fail in the clash with modernity. Thereby, there is a need in an underlying cause to nominate and theoretically substantiate new sociopolitical phenomena, such as populism, post-truth, fake news, and others. According to the author of the article, this cause is a change in the public paradigm, which was considered by Zygmunt Bauman, Nikita Moiseev, Krzysztof Nawratek, Manuel Castells and Emma Kiselyova, Philip Cooke, Guy Standing, et al. The article reveals the difference and constructs general provisions of the new social world. The place of youth in this future is traditionally associated with the mechanism of socialization, in which political relations, as one of the areas, always occupy pride of place. The author recalls the basic theories of political socialization, noting that all of them were connected with institutions that performed a systemic function. By this, in theoretical and methodological terms, he tests various theories of political socialization for the possibility of their integration in the design of a new society. To verify it, in the summer of 2019, the author and his research team conducted a survey among students of Tomsk, one of the four Russian university cities in the Top 100 of the QS Best Student Cities ranking. They also developed and conducted an expert survey of theorists and practitioners of political socialization in all four Russian cities from the QS ranking (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk and Tomsk) on the effectiveness of existing institutions of political socialization. The results of the empirical studies complement each other, correlate with the theoretical assessment of the current state of society, and have a significant scientific and practical value at both the federal and city levels.

DT Article
DE academic diplomacy; Dartmouth meetings; Pugwash movement; educational
   exchanges; University diplomacy
AB The article analyses the historical aspects and current features of academic diplomacy. The author emphasizes the scholars' lack of ideological contamination, which allows them to treat the problems of society more objectively. Consistency of scholarly knowledge, the integrity of academia as a social system, and scholars' high degree of accountability for their research achievements form the ground for the successful functioning of academic institutions of diplomacy. This gained an impetus after the world found itself standing at the brink of military actions involving weapons of mass destruction. One of the most effective institutions of academic diplomacy was the Pugwash Conference, when Soviet scientists, trapped behind the "Iron Curtain" and without contacts with colleagues abroad, convinced the government of the need to engage in a wide-ranging international dialogue to discuss the dangers that nuclear weapons pose to the world. Another effective form of academic diplomacy at that time was the Dartmouth Conference, an informal dialogue of Soviet and American intellectuals. Currently, academic diplomacy is experiencing an extensive upsurge - the list of issues and problems discussed is getting longer, the number of participants is growing, new formats and discussion platforms keep appearing. Academics now routinely participate in international conferences, get published in international journals, and not only scholars but also students are involved in academic mobility nowadays. The role of a university has also changed; it has become a discussion platform where scholars, politicians, representatives of business and civil society interact. Whereas previously academic diplomacy was accessible to and carried out by only a limited number of distinguished scholars, now it finds its ways onto various levels. Therefore, the issue of coordinating efforts at these levels is vital. Another urgent issue is the accountability of scholars for the results they achieve. Unreliable data has not only academic but also political significance these days. Like never before, the development of science and education and implementing emerging technologies is capable of critically influencing global processes. Scholars can make a lot of the things happening in the world today beneficial or, at least, reduce their possible negative consequences. It is academic diplomacy that can assist in achieving it.

Most obviously, Solov'ev's rapid ascent into the party nomenklatura during the interwar years exemplifies the dramatic trajectory that many in party service enjoyed during this period. Once in office, Solov'ev promptly embraced the Stalinist political culture that had promoted him there, at times even emulating the general secretary himself. Finally, Solov'ev's postwar disgrace and ruin reveal much about the broader functioning of this political system, particularly in regard to Joseph Stalin's concerns about the USSR's emergent party elite.

The authors examine it in the frame of discourse of "Gayropa" that represents the EU via changes in gender order of the West European societies. The pro-Kremlin media coverage of the "Rape of Europe" contributes to positioning Russia in the world, maintaining power legitimacy in the country, and supporting gender order in Russian society. The media discourse treats it as an evidence of decline of the European civilization. (C) 2019 The Regents of the University of California. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   ideologies; national-state identity; political consciousness; political
   behavior; projective methods; distant assessment
AB The article presents the conceptual and methodological foundations of the political-psychological analysis of political values developed by the author. Their necessity is due to the complexity of the phenomenon under study, its dual social and psychological nature and multiplicity of manifestations in political practice, on the one hand, and due to the lack of an integrated approach to its study in modern science and the availability of theoretical and instrumental potential of political psychology, on the other. The author proceeds from the understanding of political values as semantic determinants in the sphere of politics, offers a conceptual analysis of the concept of "political value" and an original definition revealing the psychological nature of the phenomenon under study. The concept justifies that political values have the following features: they are few in number, hierarchically ordered and systematically organized, they manifest at the level of mass and individual consciousness. They are resistant to changes in the socio-political context, are symbolic in nature, are associated with the needs and attitudes of people and regulate their political behavior. Political values are expressed in abstract categories, the semantic content of which is revealed in political representations. Political values in society change in the process of sociocultural crises caused by political and socio-economic transformations. The methodology of the study of political values, which develops the conceptual provisions of the author's approach and determines the possibilities for the operationalization of theoretical positions for an empirical study, is based on the provisions of cognitive psychology and the theory of social cognition. Methodological principles presented at different levels of the methodology (general scientific, specific scientific and methodological) are normative in nature and are prescriptions for research activities, both in the field of theoretical developments and in the field of empirical studies of the problem of values. The generalization of the methodological tools developed in the framework of various sociological and psychological approaches allows identifying the most effective diagnostic techniques. The complex of the political-psychological methods is formed on the basis of two basic research strategies - contact diagnostics, allowing to study a person in direct interaction with him or her, and distant assessment, involving the identification of psychological characteristics of a person at a distance through the study of the products of his or her activity. The concept and methodology formulated by the author form a new segment of political and psychological knowledge - the psychology of political values. Diagnostic tools and interpretative schemes developed on its basis allow filling in the existing methodological lacuna and open up new methodological possibilities for further empirical studies of political values in Russian society.

AB The paper examines the potential role of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) in implementation of the UN-initiated 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular; the Sustainable Development Goals relating to combining long-term growth of global economy with protection of the Earth's environment, i.e. the creation of low-carbon (colloquially "green") economy. By definition, such a transition is highly capital-intensive, thus demanding mobilization of all available sources of financing. SWFs as state-run investment vehicles are among the most prospective ones. In recent decade, they noticeably strengthened their role in the world economy. SWFs proved to be the fastest growing group of institutional investors. Their cumulative AUM was estimated at around 7.4 Billion US dollars as of early 2018. By now, the world's leading SWFs from Norway, China, Singapore, Persian Gulf and some other states evolved into full-fledged market-driven investors with an active portfolio management strategy. In the conditions of current economic and geo-political turbulence SWFs show growing interest to the opportunities of "green" financing while seeking for viable alternatives to the increasingly fading traditional fixed-income instruments. However, the scale of SWFs' involvement in the creation of global "green" economy is still rather tiny as compared to the needs of respective investments, the activities of private business, as well as to the state funds' own financial capabilities. While considering the reasons of current situation and the prospects of its improvement the author argues that a massive "greening" of SWFs' investment strategies can (and should) be triggered by powerful political push from the respective national governments, namely, by major legal re-formatting of their mandates in the light of the Sustainable Development Goals. It can be expected that, with such push in place, in the upcoming years the state investment vehicles may change the rules, as well as the whole landscape, of the global "green "financing system.

AB Ataman Nikolai Ivanovich Svyatopolk-Mirsky came under harsh criticism, targeted by his contemporaries from the liberal camp, as a persecutor of enlightenment who "has failed to completely abolish science, but not thanks to the lack of enthusiasm." On the other hand, today's historians urge the academic community to re-assess the figure of the ataman who contributed to opening several new educational institutions on the Don. In our paper, we tried to throw light on the situation by deliberately focusing on the policy of N.I. Svyatopolk-Mirsky in education. As a result, we found out that numerous close-downs of gymnasiums, initiated by the ataman, and reduced number of students can be explained not so much by political considerations but by criminal and educational reasons, and the process began after 1885, when a gymnasium principal fled Novocherkassk following an attack by his students. At the same time, instead of closed gymnasiums, N.I. Svyatopolk-Mirsky established technical and vocational schools that were long urgently needed. Our primary conclusion is that although N.I. Svyatopolk-Mirsky pursued a logical and reasonable educational policy in general, he made a number of mistakes - he excessively cut enrolment in gymnasiums and failed to provide the region with graduates from the network of vocational schools he created.

AB A The article considers the etymology of the word "teleology", its meaning in philosophy, knowledge management, history of ideas and biophilosophy, law and constitutionalism. The teleological principle is considered as a necessary ontological prerequisite for understanding reality in general, and legal reality in particular. The author explores the theoretical foundations of teleological constitutionalism as a legal phenomenon, the interrelationship of teleology, modern constitution and constitutionalism in modern science of constitutional law, the ratio of the methodological, normative foundations of teleological constitutionalism, as well as questions of the goals of developing and improving Russian constitutionalism in political and legal practice. The author discusses the scientific approaches to understanding the nature and characteristics of Russian, comparative constitutionalism in the scientific works of Russian and foreign researchers. The article analyzes the problem of psychological constitutionalism, which forms a request for the promotion of public interest in the activities of public authorities in the state. This article substantiates the scientific and legal-political significance of the matrix of constitutional goals and values in Russia, examines the influence of teleology and axiology on the formation of a constitutional matrix of goals and values of the development of the state and society. The author believes that it is necessary to take into account Russia's participation in international and European integration, the practice of official interpretation by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation of the provisions of the Constitution on the foundations of the constitutional system, the principles of Russian constitutionalism, fundamental rights and freedoms, duties of a person and citizen in constitutional and European space. Such a matrix can be created with mandatory reliance on the ideology of Russian constitutionalism and the constitutional identity of the Russian state and society, the constitutional principles of legal order. The article uses the methods of comparative and system analysis, the method of constitutional design, concrete historical and formal legal methods of analysis. The article identifies the difficulties and shortcomings of Russian constitutionalism, formulates some directions and proposals for the development and improvement of constitutionalism. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the constitution as an environment for legal innovation, public morality and constitutional identity. The study analyzes the theoretical foundations and comparative experience of constitutional identity, the problem of interpreting the constitution from the standpoint of progressive and actualized development in the context of ensuring not only the interests of the state and its head, parliament or government, but also citizens and their associations, which should be perceived as a constitutional community participating in the security of the viability of the constitution.

AB The article began life as, and retains the character of, spoken argument for not allowing the neurosciences to shape the agenda of the history of the human sciences. This argument is then used to suggest purposes and content for the journal, History of the Human Sciences. The style is rhetorical, even polemical, but open-ended. I challenge two cliches about the neurosciences, that they intellectually challenge other areas of knowledge, and that they are reconfiguring the human with the notion of 'brainhood'. The suggestion is that the real challenges lie elsewhere; specifically with understanding the relations of different forms of knowledge and making it conceivable by political action, or simply mode of life, to implement one way of being human rather than another. The conclusion re-asserts the value of the heading, 'history of the human sciences', and of the value of the journal with this name, as a forum in which to reflect on the identity and relations of forms of knowledge about 'the human' in all their variety.

DE globalization; world economy; international trade; transborder financial
   flows; foreign direct investments; international production; digital
   globalization; international management
AB Globalization of the world economy became the most apparent since the second part of the XX century. The article explores the present peculiarities of this process and the subsequent macroeconomic transformations, as well as various political perturbations in the today's world. The author makes an attempt to investigate in details the influence of the above mentioned factors on the traditional aspects of globalization. They are international trade, transborder financial flows (bank loans and deposits, international debt securities, foreign equity issues), foreign direct investments defining the volume and the structure of global international production. The author makes emphasis on the two most evident changes in the dynamics of globalization conditioned by the world macroeconomic developments, namely, the sharp reduction of transnational bank lending and the relative stability of the world foreign direct investments flows. The conclusions are based on the use of a large volume of the corresponding statistical information. Since the beginning of our century, a rapidly growing role in the world economy is played by the so called digital economy. It constitutes one more channel of globalization, known as digital globalization. According to majority of the economists' views, nowadays this technology makes a heavier contribution to the support of the world growth rather than trade in goods. At the same time, the author shares the opinion that digital international financial instruments play conflicting roles, encouraging globalization process and, correspondingly, economic growth, on the one part, and creating new potential risks, on the other part. The fact that globalization involves contradictionary consequences entails the use of political and legal instruments for defending the interests of consumers, facilitating innovations and raising effectiveness of the economy. The author supports the view according to which the key to settlement of the above described contradiction lies not in fighting against globalization, but in elaborating smart political measures in order to maximize the advantages of new technologies and at the same time to minimize inevitable short-term distortions. The analysis of statistical data, the study of the corresponding scientific literature and also taking into account the influence of the rapid development of the digital economy bring the author to the conclusion that globalization is not coming to an end or even permanently moving backwards. At the same time, there's no ground to believe that it would have evenly progressive character. Taking into account impetuous diffusion of various technological innovations, one can expect further transformation of structure and mechanisms of the world economy's globalization.

DE Turkish Republic; ideas; values; foreign policy; neo-ottomanism;
   neo-panturkism
AB The article considers the role of ideology and values in the formation and implementation of the current foreign policy of the Republic of Turkey. Taking into account the increasing role of regional actors such as Turkey in international politics, studying their tactics and mechanisms of influence on the global political environment is necessary to explain the further transformation of the international system.
   The study reveals the strengthening role of the ideology and values in world politics in general and in individual states, such as Turkey, in particular. Under the rule of the Justice and Development Party headed by the current President R. T. Erdogan the country began a gradual transition from "Kemalism", which includes the preservation of secularism, ProWestern democratic values and a gradual departure from the Ottoman heritage, to a more conservative domestic and foreign policy, characterized by the strengthening of Islamist and nationalist sentiments, as well as the transition to the policy of "neo-Ottomanism", "neo-pan-Turkism". The return of the idea of "aggrandizement" of the country to the official political discourse has affected the conduct of Turkey's foreign policy towards both the regional states and the world arena as a whole.
   The Republic not only began self-restoration as an autonomous actor of international relations in the eyes of the key world powers, but also started to spread its own values and ideas among the population of both the Middle East and among the states which constitute a national interest for Turkey (Russia, the post-Soviet space, etc.), thus influencing them at various levels and involving them in its orbit of influence-both politically, economically and from a humanitarian point of view.
   Using "hard power" abroad no longer meets the current Turkey's policy. Instead it relies on forging humanitarian ties, combining initiatives in the cultural, educational and scientific fields to achieve a long-term influence. The Republic of Turkey is trying to spread the following values among the world community:
   "Justice". International relations must be just and fair. For Turkey it means conformity with its national interests.
   "Religious fatalism". Government actions both at home and abroad are legitimized through references to religion and fate.
   "Democratic values". The Republic of Turkey considers itself the most democratic state in the world and contrasts itself with "Western democracies", which, according to the Turkish leadership, are spreading hegemony rather than democracy.
   "State-centrism" and collectivism. The interests of the state, society, and especially the Muslim Ummah, are placed above the values of the individual.
   "Traditional values". Given the Islamization and conservatism of Turkish society as a whole, traditional values also begin to play a major role in the general political discourse of the state.
   "Culture". Turkey also makes adjustments to the concept of "culture" in very inclusive terms, presenting its culture as a "melting pot" that can turn anything into Turkish.
   "Respect". In the eastern tradition, it is customary to show respect to elders, as well as neighbors and guests. Turkey uses a demonstration of respect in foreign policy instrumentally and pragmatically. An example of this is the address of the President of Turkey in relation to the leaders of other states: Nursultan Nazarbayev - "aksakal" of the Turkic world, Vladimir Putin is a "dear friend".

AB This paper clarifies whether representatives of the Orthodox clergy impact the electoral choices of believers, focusing on the case of agitation by the clergy. Empirically the study draws on a sociological survey conducted 2014-2015 via the social network "Vkontakte" among people identifying themselves as Orthodox believers (N=2,735). The study reveals that 18.4% of respondents witnessed Orthodox priests speak about political issues during religious services. 14.5% of respondents reported relying on the opinions of priests in making electoral decisions, and the intensity of church attendance was positively correlated with the incidence of such accounts. 6.6% of respondents did not report any political recommendations by priests, but in their electoral preferences they nevertheless relied on the opinion of Orthodox community members. The results allow us to conclude that religion has a non-trivial effect on the electoral preferences of believers in modern Russia. At least 21.1% of respondents could be identified as being exposed to the direct political influence of priests and Orthodox community members.

DT Article
DE Leningrad Affair; late Stalinism; political repressions; purges;

AB This major campaign of repression that developed in the USSR between 1949 and 1951 remains obscured by myth and speculation to the present day. The present article analyzes how Stalin planned the show trial and what sort of a "signal" it was to send to his inner circle and lower-ranking officials. To that end, this article publishes the official criminal indictment for the "Leningrad Affair," as well as commentary and an analysis of the crimes that were attributed to A.A. Kuznetsov and his comrades-in-arms. The criminal indictment is published in its totality here for the first time. This is an important historical source, insofar as it depicts the case in the way that the dictator intended it to be viewed. Its inconsistencies and poor argumentation testify to the authorities' failure to successfully organize this political show trial and develop a persuasively constructed indictment. The article also investigates the process according to which the central "Leningrad Affair" show trial was prepared. The authors track the early versions of the indictment and show how Stalin altered the court case in an effort to make it more persuasive. The article also demonstrates the bankruptcy of the accusations within the indictment, which could have been leveled against any regional strongman in the USSR but were instead made against the leadership of only a single party organization. The text of the indictment is rendered here without ellipses and furnished with biographical information about the people named within the context of the criminal case It contains more information than the already published sentence of the court in regard to the "Leningrad Affair," allowing for an array of new conclusions to be drawn about the nature of this case.

AB This case study is an example of interdisciplinary research, which couples the linguistic aspects with the study of public political discourse in social media. The purpose of the study is to identify how "realism" terms and national/global agenda are represented in Twitter discourse of leaders of countries which claim to be global powers today. Obviously, it is impossible to claim a high status in the modern world without participation in global discussions (including the level of influence on public opinion in Twitter). We collect data from official accounts of the U.S. President Donald Trump, France's President Emmanuel Macron, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, and Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Then we propose a research method developed by us which contains 5 stages. The main method of research is traditional content analysis, not only selective (under this or that theory), but also "frontline" one. We are interested in the subject matter (key, most frequent vocabulary) that dominates the considered texts. We separate the same amounts of text (approximately 33 000 words) in the content of the Twitter pages of Trump, Macron, Putin and Medvedev. Then we quantify the words and identify the key concepts which are specific for political realism and political idealism. We perform a "frontal" general analysis of all the most frequently used concepts. We make a quantitative assessment of the nature of the use of political leaders' key concepts (this stage of analysis is divided on several sub-stages). Finally we compare the frequency of concepts' use by leaders of the West and Russia.
   Putin-Medvedev pair has obvious coincidences with Trump at the external level, but a significant divergence in the base level, i.e. this is another picture of the world, another choice of subjects, in contrast to Trump-Macron pair. Russian leaders are focused on domestic problems of the country. Global agenda is not sufficiently represented in Twitter accounts of Russian leaders. Trump and Macron discuss common (global) themes herewith they have different ideological preferences.

AB The Victorian era is a unique historical period of turbulent political, economic and social changes. These changes also touched upon science: the emergence of new theories and experimental data, new discoveries and inventions, the growth of the number of scientific societies, the debate about teaching methods in universities and the significance of science and scientists for the state laid the foundations for the institutional structure of the modern sciences. In addition, it is the Victorian era when a fundamentally new theoretical discipline, the philosophy of science, was born. At the heart of the article, there is the personality and social circle of its founder, William Whewell, the author of the fundamental work "The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences founded upon their history". The author reconstructs the making of the philosophy of science as an independent discipline, considering it, on the one hand, as a product of the Victorian era, and on the other - as a tool for the formation of the modern sciences in all their diversity.

AB The article analyzes the impact of the Arab Spring on destabilization processes in Eastern Europe. The authors show how the success of the Arab revolutions influenced the rise of protest activity in Eastern Europe in 2011. The similarities of the protests in Eastern Europe with the protests of the Arab Spring period are demonstrated. We also analyze ways of borrowing patterns of destabilization. The wave of protest activity after 2011 is compared with the previous wave of protest activity initiated by the global financial-economic crises of 2008-2009. In addition to the external factor of the Arab Spring, the article examines the internal factors of the protest activity of the second wave of the economic crisis associated with the economic crises in Portugal, Italy, Spain, and Greece. The authors define the most typical forms of destabilization for Eastern Europe: anti-government demonstrations, riots, terrorist actions, and guerrilla warfare. The contribution of the Ukrainian Revolution in 2014 to the dynamics of the most violent forms of protest in Eastern Europe is also analyzed. In explaining the special case of Ukraine which breaks with the general trend of Eastern Europe, the authors show that Ukraine experienced a transition from less-violent forms of destabilization (anti-government demonstrations and riots) to more violent ones (guerrilla warfare and terrorist attacks) in 2013-2014. The reasons for the growth of terrorist activity and guerrilla warfare as well as the role of the war in Donbass are discussed. It is shown that though the case of Ukraine is unique for Eastern Europe in the period under study, it has many parallels on a global scale.

AB The strategic development of the agricultural sector in any region should focus on the effective use of production and resource potential to achieve the long-term visualization of "desired" future in the context of global economic, technological, social and political challenges. Current socio-economic conditions (urbanization, globalization, digitalization, innovativeness, etc.) require a revision of traditional strategic planning for the development of the agricultural sector in the light of new innovative ways to design regional strategies. The purpose of the study is to improve the methodology of strategic planning in the regional agro-industry based on innovative approaches and its practical testing on the example of one of the regions. The study is conducted on the basis cluster, scenario and project approaches in designing a strategy for the region's agricultural sector. The study solves the following tasks: analysis of methodological approaches and best practices of regional planning; development of a methodological model to design regional strategy for agriculture; testing the proposed methodological approaches and development of possible scenarios for agriculture to achieve the "desired" future on the example of one of the regions. As a result of the study, there is a comprehensive methodological model of regional agro-industry strategy, containing a logical sequence of the strategy designing process and justification for the use of variable approaches at each stage. The practical significance of the research results lies in the possible application of the proposed methodological model to design the agro-industry strategy in any region worldwide with similar conditions of development..

DE sanctions; sanctions policy; unilateral restrictive measures; Eurasian
   Economic Union; Eurasian integration; Russia; Belarus; Kazakhstan;
   Armenia; Kyrgyzstan
AB This article deals with the political and economic implications of sanctions against Russia for the functioning of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), which became operational in 2015.
   Assuming that the political conduct of EAEU states is based on political pragmatism, the author concludes that in spite of the fact that they provide official support to Eurasian integration, they also have an interest in acceding to alternative projects that strengthen their sovereignty. Therefore, the major challenge to the Union derives primarily from the political sphere since the number of alternatives to Eurasian integration is gradually increasing, disrupting relations between members and Russia.
   In this respect, the correlation between western sanctions and the EAEU's economic growth rate is of great importance. The principal purpose of sanctions is to limit a country's ability to pursue its independent and active policy, including the development of foreign economic projects. Consequently, anti-Russian sanctions must have influenced the EAEU and its key members. In 2016, Russia demonstrated a decrease in gross domestic product (GDP) which had an even greater negative impact on Belarus and Kazakhstan. Nevertheless, they have not only managed to regain lost ground on economic performance, but also to achieve some growth in GDP. Such dynamics confirm the author's hypothesis that the members of the EAEU have room for manoeuvre if some external player influences their political and economic development.
   However, the EAEU's internal capacities for dynamic development should not be overestimated. The Union faces problems such as weak aggregate GDP in comparison with the leading world economies, low GDP growth rates in the member states and a relatively low rate of EAEU population growth. In this context, the Union definitely needs to expand its economic influence in the global arena.
   Although EAEU states might have divergent interests, the author concludes that a pragmatic assessment of the benefits from participation in the Eurasian integration project, including the preservation of their identity and greater room for manoeuvre in their foreign trade and economic activities, remains the principal factor maintaining the integrity of the Union.

AB This article analyzes the results of the all-Russian sociological surveys that, in recent years, were realized by the Federal Center of Theoretical and Applied Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The main purpose of this article is to identify important shifts in the mood and expectations of Russians, from the point of view of the future of the state. The authors pay special attention to the reasons requests for changes have become actualized in the public consciousness, as well as its main components and its potential actors. According to the authors, the actualization of this request was the result of a sharp change in the vector of public priorities that represents a reaction a significant part of Russian society has to the authorities' inability to ensure their obligations, under the so-called "paternalistic consensus", which for many years remained the basis of the request for stability. It is shown that this request, firstly, is still of an intrasystemic nature and focuses the authority (more likely, through wishes rather than requirements) on the evolutionary change of society, not on the radical institutional transformation. Secondly, this request is very amorphous, both in its ideological content and in its social base, and focuses mainly on the today's socio-economic realities. Thirdly and lastly, the youth is its main bearer and the most obvious beneficiary; however, sociological polls demonstrate that other social groups and strata are also interested in overcoming the existing status quo and in initiating constructive changes. The request is focused substantively on such basic ideas as a) the minimization of various social inequalities; b) social justice, c) democracy, d) the greatness of the state. At the same time, the majority of the citizens who took part in the sociological polls consider that Russia should base its state's greatness and status as a key international player on its inclusion in the most economically developed and politically influential countries of the world, not on building up its military power. It talks about the public reevaluation of the state's role and the dissolution of state values as a key tool for the realization of the common good. The vast majority of Russia's citizens today support demands for the authority's openness, providing opportunities for citizens to influence authority through legitimate democratic procedures. A growing number of "selfsufficient" Russians are striving to orientate themselves in their daily lives, not on assistance from the authorities, but on their own forces. However, the readiness of such "self-sufficient" citizens for collective action is low, they consider themselves as supporters of change, but not as the actors of social change.

DT Article
DE Cameralism; Justi; translations; 18th century; Russia; police
ID NOBILITY
AB Cameralism as a doctrine and practice corresponds to the era of mercantilism - the 16th-18th centuries - the period when economic thought ceased to be medieval but has not yet become political economy. Recently, this direction in economic thought, the corps of texts about the art and science of management and economics, have become more actively revised and updated. The subject of the article is the translation into Russian in the second half of the 18th century of the books of the most famous cameralist of this period - Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi (1717-1771). Revealed translations of Justi on cameral and police sciences, on industry development form a vast array of texts of more than three thousand pages. Justy is the most translated Russian economist of the 18th century, and it was also possible to show that not French, but Russian translations turned out to be the hugest for Justi himself. In addition to comparing the texts with the originals, identifying the terminological strategy of the translators and paying close attention to any abbreviations, additions and introductions, special attention was paid to finding information about the translators themselves, about the circumstances associated with the organization and payment of the translation. Books were prepared at two major academic centers - Moscow University and St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Their translation was distinguished, with rare exceptions, by its completeness and literalism. Basically, they lacked scientific elaboration, i.e. they were only translations without controversy, informative forewords and additions. Large circulations and a luxurious type of publication indicated that they were oriented towards the general public and carried out the symbolic function of "enlightenment". The term Policei shows the strategy of translators who rightly tried to give the "police" a broader meaning and translated as good order, good organization and good morals, which made the translation text even more normative.

AB Modern socio-political discourse on various layers of communication exploits the notions of post-truth, post-truth politics and fake news, which became topical in the wake of the Brexit referendum and US Presidential Campaign of 2016. These events, as well as many others, caused a shift in political science and exposed a need for the reconsideration of the impact of online space on the development of socio-political systems all over the world. Besides, these events exposed a research need for political content studies in the online space at micro and macro-levels. The online processes are complex and non-linear, thus, require complex and hybrid analytical methods - for example, a combination of network analysis, mathematic analysis and linguistic and discourse analysis - the tools used by the authors of the article to study the political content produced during the Trump's US Presidential Campaign 2016. The purpose of the research was to identify the peculiarities of political content production and the impact it could have on prospective voters (such as shaping public opinion, agitation and construction of a required expected behavior). The empirical foundation of the research is metadata of the social networks, required for a network analysis; likewise, the text corpus, a set of messages produced by D. Trump's team during the US Presidential Campaign 2016 in the same social networks, was the empirical base for linguistic discourse analysis. The network analysis, which originates from the theory of complex networks, was applied to study of the process of political content consumption by online users (prospective and active voter groups), and in particular, how the production capacity of social network users, as regards the produced or spread political content, can determine their roles (the opinion leaders, the sensors, the implementers, the readers, the reputation players). The linguistic discourse analysis allowed to identify the key peculiarities of the researched political content, produced as a part of a successful marketing campaign (aimed at promoting a candidate for the presidency) in social networks and online space as a whole. The study of the Trump's US Political Campaign 2016 revealed that the online dominance, acquired via social network marketing (which is a result of communicative strategies exploitation), can convert into a political dominance in the offline space.

The positions of the mainstream parties - democratic Christians, conservatives, social democrats - have weakened. Parties of political alternative - nationalists, social populists, regional separatists - increase their electoral possibilities. Western European political old-timers and their colleagues in the European Parliament from the Eastern Europe constantly disagree with each other. The process of change of political elites is obvious, and all this does not contribute to the normal functioning of the European Union.

   theoretical sociology; ontology of social reality; sociological realism;

AB Author reviews the Warsaw period works by Leon Petrazycki and his logical and methodological studies in order to reconstruct his project of sociology based on them. In his intention, sociology should have become the common foundation of the whole set of social sciences (theory of law and morality, political economy, etc.). However, according to Petrazycki, sociology does not yet exist as a strict science, and he considers contemporary sociological concepts as exhibits of the Scientific Pathology Museum. The author denies traditional identification between Petrazycki's sociological project and the empirical tradition in sociology. Petrazycki constructs sociology as theoretical science and uses following methodological tools: 1) the principle of adequacy of the theory, 2) the theorem on n + 1 theories; 3) the doctrine of positions (atomic elements of judgments) as the basis for classifying sciences. In Petrazycki's interpretation, the subject of sociology is evolutionary processes of behavior motivation. Sociology of Petrazycki, known from the summaries of his disciples, does not fully correspond to his own logical and methodological criteria: it is reduced to the theory of genesis and evolution of ethical (moral and legal) motivation. At the same time, he considers sociology of law to be a superfluous discipline. Probably, this incompleteness of the sociology project is a reason why Petrazycki has refused to publish the finished manuscript on sociology. Finally, author discusses how Pitirim Sorokin had used some logical and methodological ideas of Petrazycki to develop his own system of sociology.

AB In this article, we aim to analyse the research discourse in the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) as regards Russian soft power, which is considered as hard power, and to compare the theses that dominate this discourse with the actual interactions between Russia and the three states in media, education, and culture. Each Baltic country has built a system of political and legal restrictions to diminish the effect of Russian soft power, which is considered in terms of hard power, i.e. as a threat to national security. The current forms of Russian soft power are becoming less productive in the region and their use in the negative political context of bilateral relations has the opposite effect for Russia - the country loses in reputation and image. The main factor at play is the information content of the Russian-language media space. At odds with the historical and political views of a significant part of the Baltic States' ruling class, it is becoming the target of counteraction. At the same time, Russian high and mass culture and, partly, educational services are in demand from both Baltic Russian speakers and ethnic Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians. Our analysis shows that the views of Baltic researchers that Russian soft power is politics-driven and foreign to the region are exaggerated and biased. In its turn, Russian soft power in the Baltics retains the potential to aid the country's foreign policy, being a complement to the latter rather than its direct tool.

   Social Networks; Digital Reality; Big Data; Information
AB The spread of digital marketing technologies has become a global practice that significantly improves the quality of life and facilitates realization of individual consumer strategies. However, implementation of these technologies also has certain socio-anthropological risks which are discussed in the paper. Marketing manipulation can be very effective, sophisticated and implicit in digital reality which is stated on the basis of socio-anthropological and economic phenomena analysis.
   The authors offer to highlight the most significant social and anthropological threats caused by an active and often unethical use of digital technologies. The first threat is a real danger of person's personal profile deformation, his cognitive and psycho-emotional abilities, partial dissociation of his identity and dominance of clip forms of thinking in digital tagging environment that often permeates an entire cyber-space. The second threat is digitalization of banking and trading sphere and their combining on the basis of scoring and screening interests. This happens when banks begin to collect information about the client base of potential borrowers not only on social networks but also on clients' consumer basket in order to determine complete personal profile of a possible borrower. In such a way, more complete information is obtained using transaction data of payments by a bank card in cinemas, pharmacies, medical institutions, train stations. The authors outline that not only social and psychological profile but also problems of health, cultural and political preferences and other facts of personal life could be easily restored after an extended screening, violating ethical norms of invasion in private life of any person and can cause total control of citizens. Finally, the third risk is the possibility of personal data leakage from BIG DATA databases of large banks and trading networks, including details of private life or sale of this information by banks to other corporations, such as collecting agencies, in order to solve their problems.
   The social survey "Modern social technologies as a tool of identity management" was undertaken by the authors in 2019 to study the perception of manipulation by the citizens in Russia. In particular, the results of the survey show that 43.4% of the respondents are absolutely negative about personal database collecting based on the use of personal bank cards, and only 3.1 % are positive. Answering to the question "How do you feel about the leakage and sale of your personal data from banks, shops, medical institutions?" 87.9% show negative emotional attitude, and only 3.5% - the positive one.
   The authors conclude that private data collected semi-legally through banking and marketing screening increasingly become a commodity, which cannot but cause a sense of protest and necessity for legal and ethical assessment and development of social and state regulators for harmonious development of digital marketing which serves citizens, not harms them, becoming a means of control and suppression of freedom.

AB The article touches upon the process of transformation of a socio-political organization in the legal system, caused by integration of digital technologies and autonomous algorithmic systems. It is justified that the development of machine education and artificial intelligence systems can result in human suspension from taking important social and political decisions. Impermeability and fluidity of modern digital technologies provides hidden functioning mode of the latter, whilst their specificity is not included in the formulated agenda, creating and taking managerial decisions or planning everyday life activity. The article proves that the aftereffects of the fourth technological revolution claim for returning of the human rights standards, freedoms and legal interests as the leading form of a reference point in the global digital rivalry and in the development of certain social systems, also the necessity to establish a distinct system of human rights guarantee and human safety in the era of developing principally new digital relations is proved. Meanwhile, digital information legislation needs systematization and a strict consistent state.

AB The article is devoted to the study of the conceptual and technological foundations of the development of a national branding strategy based on the innovative competencies of the defense industry complex. It has been determined that the strategy of national branding in the domestic policy is correlated with the task of increasing public confidence in the institutions of government and reducing transaction costs in the process of political management. It is noted that in the foreign policy aspect, the design of the national branding strategy in the context of the rapidly changing global world order is connected with the need to respond to the global challenges Russia is facing in the modern world. It is revealed that effective national branding includes significant competitive competences of the state through the development of key sectors of national industry, culture, art, education. Innovations in the composition of the Russian economy and politics contributes to the fullness of the national brand. The implementation of the innovation policy by innovative enterprises and universities as key subjects of national branding and the diffusion of innovations in the social and political spheres contribute to the formation of the national brand. The article shows that the innovation activity of the military-industrial complex can be a subject field in the design of the national branding strategy. Innovative enterprises, universities and research institutions of the military-industrial complex, assuming their effective activity and its communicative representation, form territorial brands. The "innovation belts", which are formed with the participation of innovative subjects of the defense industry ensuring the security of the state, promote territorial and national branding. The communication strategy is aimed at supporting the innovation policy in the military-industrial complex and its representation in relation to target groups. It is concluded that, ultimately, effective national branding is aimed at strengthening the global competitiveness of the state, its international political influence and domestic political stability.

AB The problem of capital outflow from the Russian economy is considered in three aspects: export of capital, flight of capital and drain of capital. Permanent net capital outflow through private and public channels allows the state to devalue the ruble and create a favorable environment for export-oriented mining industries. This circumstance, firstly, inhibits the qualitative growth of the Russian economy, and secondly, is a sign of its peripheral nature in the global capitalism.

AB Against the background of new US-Russia and US-China political confrontation and the comprehensive crisis surrounding nuclear arms control treaties, there may be little immediate hope for successful talks on the non-weaponization of space. Even so, if and when political preconditions change and serious arms control negotiations resume, the non-militarization of outer space will inevitably return to the disarmament agenda. The United States and Russia, as a minimum, have an obvious common security interest in space - limiting as much as possible the dedicated anti-satellite (ASAT) systems that threaten the satellites that are designed to warn each nation of a ballistic missile attack by any state. A focus on the verifiable ban on the testing of such anti-satellite systems would give the United States and Russia a practical starting point for further negotiations on the non-militarization of space.

ID PHILOSOPHY
AB The starting point of the study is the question of the origin of evidence in cognition. On the example of the concept of pure logic by Edmund Husserl, the role of evidence in the foundation of logico-theoretical knowledge is considered. The advantages of this concept are demonstrated in opposition to the relativistic interpretation of cognition. The principle of the analytic truth of identity sentences with a problematization of the distinction between pure rationality and real conditions of rule implementation is criticized. The connection between language and thinking in the context of the relativistic argument of the "late" Ludwig Wittgenstein is discussed. The results of the research show that the universalistic interpretation of cognition in Husserl's sense resolves the problem of relativism, but does not answer the question about its own foundations. The assumption of a necessary correlation between the logico-theoretical and logico-psychological content of thinking in cognition turns out to be fictitious. When applied to its own principles, the apriorism of Husserl's type demonstrates formal limitations and epistemological incompleteness. This is confirmed by an attempt to explicate the epistemological foundations of logico-theoretical principles within a formal self-definition. Then the question of the existence of universal principles in cognition is reduced to the rule-following problem. The interpretation of Wittgenstein's skeptical argument points to the irreducibility of logic.-theoretical knowledge to universal principles of thinking. From this, a conclusion is made about the incoherence of universalistic views.

TI Universal Basic Income: The Political Economic Aspect
SO EKONOMICHESKAYA POLITIKA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE universal basic income; social welfare; labor market; social benefits
   administration; paternalism
AB The idea of universal basic income first emerged in the Late Middle Ages. In the second half of the 20th century, it began to be actively discussed as a political alternative in the U.S., European countries, and some others. Lately this notion has become very popular. In a number of countries, such as Canada, Finland and the Netherlands, local experiments involving basic income have been taking place. This article addresses the main arguments for and against basic income. Some authors regard basic income as a populist and paternalist policy, which is an incorrect judgment, as its adequate implementation could lead to budgetary savings, reduce the size of government, and lower state interference in the lives of citizens. Another objection is that basic income would discourage labor and stimulate social dependency; however, local experiments in partial introduction of basic income and similar benefits have not confirmed this statement. The claim that basic income is too expensive of a measure does not consider that it is supposed to replace numerous other social benefits and would therefore most likely result in reduced administrative costs. Basic income is a social welfare measure most compatible with the nature of labor and the labor market under the technological revolution that has begun, where labor has been getting increasingly distributed and aimed at the workers' self-realization rather than their survival. In practice, basic income is to be implemented gradually, only covering selected groups of individuals at first and expanding the range of recipients over time. In basic income administration, a certain role can be played by municipal governments.

DE Dostoevsky; Poland; Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth;
   Polish question
AB The article addresses the problems of positioning the Polish state on an imaginary map of the world of the outstanding Russian writer, philosopher and journalist Fyodor Dostoevsky. This publication is an analysis of Dostoevsky's statements and judgments about the place of Poland in Russia and in the world from fiction and journalistic literature, criticism, letters and diary entries. The work is divided into three parts. The introduction formulates the reasons for Dostoevsky's attention to the Polish problem, substantiates the relevance of the study on the basis of reference to the historiography of the issue, determines the subject and method of research. In the main part, the author examines the image of Poland that was formed in Dostoevsky's works. The features of the writer's approach to determining the place of Poland on an imaginary map of the world are identified. The emphasis is placed on the heterogeneity of the definition of the term "Poland", for which the epithets used by the writer are given: old and new, aristocratic and folk, Latin and Slavic, Catholic and Russian. Dostoevsky's approach to the possibility of the existence of Russia and Poland within the framework of a single state is analyzed; the approach consisted in the perspective of creating the Pan-Slavic empire, including the West Slavic Catholic peoples. In the final part of the article, the author concludes that Dostoevsky's position on determining the place of Poland on the world map seems to be rather contradictory. On the one hand, the writer points in many ways to the complexity and even impossibility of the coexistence of Russia and Poland within one state due to the existing contradictions between the two civilizations which can be overcome only by assimilation, that is, by the destruction of the remnants of Old Poland. On the other hand, Dostoevsky regards the Polish lands as an integral part of the empire, although their inclusion, which happened in an "artificial" way, was ahead of its time. Only after the formation and the development of a united Orthodox empire would Western Slavs have been able to naturally integrate into the common Pan-Slavic empire.

AB The article is dedicated to the analysis of three dimensions of the post-Soviet "frozen" conflicts - internal, post-imperial / post-Soviet and international, the dialectics of interconnection of these dimensions in relations between Russia and the EU / West, as well as to the prospects for resolving these problems. The formation of new independent states as a result of the collapse of the former Yugoslavia and the USSR gave rise to separatism of national minorities, large enough to count on their own statehood, which caused many intrastate conflicts. Despite economic, political, cultural and ethnic specifics of such conflicts, as well as their differences in terms of geopolitical position, they all have certain common essential features. These are: the bitterness of the dominant titular ethnic group defeated in the quarrel with separatists as a result of the external forces' intervention, the refugee factor (with the exception of Transnistria), the loss of territorial integrity, and the fact that in the new independent states communism was replaced by nationalism. The exception during the collapse of the USSR was only Russia, where the communist system was defeated by the revolutionary democrats, while Russian nationalists stood for the revival of the Soviet empire. However, this period was very short. As contradictions between Russia and its Western partners ripened and escalated, conflicts in the post-Soviet space became a mirror reflection of their rivalry and a threat to international and regional security. This was fully demonstrated by the Ukrainian conflict. The battle for the post-Soviet space between Russia and the West cannot be stopped without rethinking their strategies in the region, which will undoubtedly require some courage in admitting the mistakes made. It seems, the NATO leadership must recognize that the Alliance's expansion strategy to the east has outlived itself and is not bringing anything but clashes with Russia. The European Union should think about the need to reformat the Eastern Partnership and offer Russia a new cooperation project in the post-Soviet space, based on specific functional projects in different areas and built on the principle of flexible geometry including everyone. Russia, in turn, must recognize that the main thing in ensuring its national security is not to create enemies in its immediate environment and beyond. Today, many politicians and experts in both the EU and NATO complain that there is no trust in relations between Russia and the West. The settlement of "frozen" conflicts in the CIS can serve as the beginning of the revival of trust, which arises only in the process of joint problem solving.

   "educated class"; Saudi foreign policy; Iran; United States; Russia
AB The period after 2015, when Salman bin Abdel Aziz came to the throne of Saudi Arabia, became the era of deep changes in the system of Saudi power as well as in the spheres of economy and policy. The attempt to overcome a "vagueness" of power, which was connected with a big number of fractures in the ruling family, promoted the rise of Prince Salman who occupied the leading positions in the national "ruling class" and began to control uniformed services. The project of socio-economic transformation "Vision: 2030" proposed by the Prince as "a reform of power", was supported by the national "educated class" considering it as a possibility to realize their own aspirations connected with diversification of economy, elimination of addiction to oil, expansion of the private sector's activity, amelioration of life quality, women's emancipation and reduction of religious establishment influence. This support strengthens Mohammed bin Salman's positions in the ruling dynasty, which was confirmed during the anticorruption company and by consequences of international scandal around "Jamal Khashoggi affair" inside Saudi Arabia. The support mentioned above was not shaken by cruel methods against those who stand for more freedom of speech inside Saudi Arabia. The article also analyzes the reasons of the Saudi foreign policy "tightening" explained by the Saudi political establishment as a result of the "Arab Spring", Iranian expansion policy, the task to oppose regional terror and ineffectiveness of President Obama's policy. For Riyadh, the development of relations with President Trump's administration is "a reanimation" of relationship with its strategic partner and "an instrument to curb the Iranian regime", despite the contradictions with this administration appearing on the question of Jerusalem in particular. In its turn, Saudi-Russian relations, in spite of the mutual interest in its development, are not able to overcome the existing differences concerning the most burning issues of the Middle East. The amelioration of economic relations which was marked during King Selman's visit to Moscow in October 2017 is fragile because historically it is not based on a diverse system of bilateral contacts as in the American case.

DE Neo-Kantianism; axiology; individual; freedom; solidarity
AB This paper is devoted to the analysis of the notion of solidarity in Sergius Hessen's philosophy. He applies macrosociology of the Southwest School of Neo-Kantianism to determine the principles of interaction between an individual and a culture. The axiological method allows one to understand reality as the opposition of value and fact. A culture is a process of improving the realization of values. According to Hessen, values exist independently of any individual. In this case, any person is free, he or she is not a mechanism for the formation of culture. Freedom is a necessary condition for the creativity of an individual, which makes it possible to contribute to the development of this culture. However, there is no unambiguous interpretation of freedom. Freedom is a value, like science and art, so its content is revealed in different ways in different cultures. Any individual realizes his or her freedom in creativity. But creativity is possible only as making a personal contribution to the embodiment of a cultural value. According to Hessen, a person can understand the logic of embodying a value in a certain culture due to Hegel's dialectic. The dialectical method is a scheme for understanding the dynamics of the embodiment of cultural values. Thus, through the dialectical method, every person can understand the specifics of the development of culture and determine the directions for self-actualization. Solidarity allows each individual to assess the current system of communities and institutions of a certain culture, and determine what needs to be changed to achieve personal freedom. Solidarity creates the possibility of correlating the tasks of cultural development and individual freedom ensuring. A common will is formed in society; this will determines whether the current system of communities and institutions corresponds to the potential for realizing personal freedom. Solidarity allows us to evaluate cultures in terms of tolerance as equivalent phenomena, each of which has its own specificity of freedom development. Therefore, the interpretation of the freedom of one culture is not suitable for determining freedom in another culture. Summing up, this paper proves that it is possible to determine the degree of freedom in a particular society only as a result of an analysis of the obstacles to personal creativity in the context of the system of communities and institutions in a certain culture.

AB Introduction. In Byzantine historical and hagiographic texts of the 9th-10th centuries reporting on events that took place in Crimea, the Klimata were repeatedly mentioned (tau alpha epsilon lambda iota mu alpha tau alpha is a plural number of tau omicron kappa lambda iota mu alpha - klimata) Kappa lambda iota mu alpha in Greek means a district in a city or part of a province. Methods. For justifying the boundaries of the Klimata, it is necessary to analyze all references to the toponym in written sources and materials of archaeological excavations in the South-Western Crimea. Analysis. During the entire period of its existence, the Klimata (archontitai) did not have autonomy. In the 7th century Cherson and Klimata were a Byzantine border province. Since the early 8th century until 841 Mountain Crimea belonged to the Khazars. Kagan united the Klimata (archontitai) of Cherson to the province of Gothia with its capital in Doros. Kagan retained the previous administration and appointed archon Klima Doras as the ruler of Gothia (Klimata). Kagan subordinated to him the archons of other fortresses and entrusted to him the collection of tribute. From 841 to the third quarter of the 11th c., the Klimata of Gothia were included into the theme of Cherson. Seals of the Turmarch of Gothia of the end of the 10th - the early 11th centuries prove the creation the Turma of Gothia within the theme of Cherson, which was ruled by a Byzantine officer-turmarch. In 1204, the province submitted to Trebizond. Results. In written sources, the toponym Klimata called only the region neighboring Cherson with the fortresses of the neighbouring peoples of the city "castris gentium ibidem adjacentium" (the Goths and the Alans). In the 7th century the Klimata of Cherson were localized on the territory of the country of Dori. In the 8th the first half (?) of the 13th centuries Gothia or the Klimata of Gothia were put there.

AB Last transformations of the innovation policy have revealed problems, connected with an effectiveness of involvement of young scientists and inventors in cutting-edge research areas (particularly, within the local experience of the institutes of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (UB RAS)). The purpose of this research consists in tracing the ways of realization of the political strategy of a breakthrough in the technological and industrial development of the country on the level of involvement of the young scientists in innovations within UB RAS institutes. An empirical sociological survey included two stages. Carried out with the heads of post-graduate Departments and with the chairpersons of Councils of Young Scientists (CYS) from 22 institutes (N=31), a series of in-depth interviews allowed hypotheses to be formulated and key problems to be revealed. The second stage involved questioning of 217 young researchers from 28 UB RAS institutes and scientific centers. The sample included young scientists mainly under 36 years old, primarily from Yekaterinburg. According to our results, the problems tend to obtain financial character as well as socio-psychological one. Increasing of basic wages of young scientists and funding of research instrument and equipment renewal along with managing an effective system of advanced training and travel grants, as well as finetuning of every young researcher autonomy from the conditions of his/her structural subdivision seem to allow the powerful youth potential of the Ural academic science to be used in a more productive way. Our results and recommendations may be extrapolated on the Russian academic science, in general, due to the similarity of administrative structures and traditions of the science community of RAS.

DE Tatarstan; Tatars; Soviet national policy; history of the Tatars; Golden
   Horde; Communist ideology; Decree of the All-Union Communist Party of
   Bolsheviks of August 9, 1944
AB Objective: To reflect on the increasing significance of the decree of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks of August 9, 1944 "About the Condition and Measures of Improving Mass-Political and Ideological Work in the Tatar Party Organization" for the development of Tatar history and culture.
   Research materials: This article is based on the documents from federal and republican archives, along with academic publications on the subject.
   Results and novelty of the research: The analysis of the development of the historiography of the Middle Ages in the Tatar ASSR and the work of Golden Horde specialists demonstrates that in post-Soviet historiography, the significance of the August 1944 Decree for the development of Tatar humanities is exaggerated. The official attempts to channel the development of the Tatar historical school were, in many respects, of the nature of formal rhetoric. Among the Tatar intelligentsia, academic discourse persisted even during the period of late Stalinism, not to mention the period of the "thaw". This was convincingly evidenced by the unfolding in the early 1950s of the discussion taking place in the pages of the journal "Voprosy istorii" (Questions of History), and the achievements of M.G. Safargaliev, Sh.F. Mukhamedyarov, M.A. Usmanov, and A. G. Mukhamadiev in the study of Golden Horde issues. However, the work of humanities scholars was of the nature of a chamber, and it did not have a wide outreach to the public. Mass consciousness was formed by Moscow-produced textbooks, which were printed in millions of copies. The medieval history of the Tatars was presented in the form of an ominous yoke, an absolute evil. In this regard, the effectiveness of the influence of the August 1944 Decree should be associated not so much with the development of the humanities as with the formation of stereotypes in the public consciousness, in which the assessment of the Golden Horde was a negative one.

ID INSCRIPTION
AB Introduction. In the Early Middle Ages, Crimea was in the sphere of influence of the Eastern Roman Empire. In the material culture of the Early Medieval population of Crimea imprinted with archaeological monuments "Byzantine components" are quite clearly visible. The group of jewellery that clearly demonstrates the Byzantine influence includes bronze finger rings with the image of Archangel Michael originating from the Gotho-Alanian burial grounds of the South-Western Crimea and from the necropoleis of the Kerch Peninsula. The article substantiates the attribution and dating of the finger rings, reveals a circle of analogies, interprets the meaning of the images, and also considers the peculiarities of wearing this type of jewellery. Methods. The author determines dating of the Crimean findings by the accompanying inventory in the graves. The paper reveals a circle of analogies for the attribution of the finger rings, analyzes findings from the territory of the Eastern Roman Empire and from areas with political and economic ties. Analysis. In the late 6th-7th centuries bronze finger rings with the image of Archangel Michael imported from Byzantium and produced in local workshops on imported samples were popular in Crimea. The signet ring of variant A of the late 6th - the first quarter of the 7th cc. with a profile portrait of the Archangel and the monogram of his name, undoubtedly, refers to Byzantine products brought from Asia Minor. The two finger rings of variant B engraved with the face and the almost full-length figure of the Archangel were made by Bosporan artisans in the 7th century on the Byzantine samples. The finger rings from Crimea depicting the Archangel belonged to young women who had a high social status. They were worn on hands, as a rule, on the right forefinger and in breast necklaces that connected fibulae. Christian symbols and plots placed on signet rings, in the view of the ancient Christians, should have given the jewellery the properties of an amulet which protected the person wearing it from all sorts of troubles. Results. The presented finger rings depicting Archangel Michael are an important source for studying the early stage of the history of Christianity in the South-Western Crimea and the Bosporus. Findings of this kind testify to the unity of culture in the Christian world and are a good example of close economic and cultural ties between the region and the Byzantine Empire in the Early Middle Ages.

LA English
DT Article
AB Since May 2016 Russia-Japan relations have entered a new stage characterized by the unprecedented activity aimed at improving relations in a comprehensive way: political and security dialogue, confidence building measures, new economic projects and people-to-people contacts. However, apart from the old problems, new limitations and asymmetries have emerged that hinder the development of bilateral relations against the background of power shift and changing strategic environment in East Asia. The article seeks to assess how deep is Russia-Japan rapprochement, what are the motivations of the two countries, major limitations, both domestic and external, expectation asymmetries and misperception gaps. It discusses the developments after the agreement between Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in November 2018 to facilitate negotiations on a peace treaty and territorial issue based on the Soviet-Japanese Declaration of 1956, and how tangible is a breakthrough. The article concludes by providing an argument for forging stronger Russia-Japan partnership and discusses the potential of bilateral relationship.

AB Introduction. The main purpose of the publication is to recreate members of the Boyar duma and palace administration, to reconstruct the high-ranking structure of the top of the Sovereign court during the period of Boyar rulling on the basis of all published and archival documents. Methods and materials. The method of genealogical analysis and the method of prosopografical investigation are applied to the research of the duma and palace composition. The author uses information from various editions of genealogical books, Gosudarev rodoslovets of 1555, lists of noble families of the late 17th c., charge and ambassadorial books, acts on land, chronicles, supplementary books of monasteries. Analysis. The author reveals the features of the highest appointments, dynamics of appointments to the Boyar duma and palace administration during the political crisis of 1533-1547.
   Results. The author notes that new appointments in the Boyar duma and palace administration depended not only on the developed political environment, but also on the patrimonial order of inheritance of the highest ranks in a narrow circle of boyar clans notable and close to the throne. One more important conclusion received as a result of the research is that during the studied period powerful aristocrats possessed two ranks of boyars (okolnichy and dvoretsky) at the same time. The explanation of this can be found, perhaps, in the process of bureaucratization of management noted by M.M. Krom, which was expressed in isolation of government from the carrier of the supreme power and formation of the professional group of managers which concentrated the most significant administrative functions in their hands.

ID GENERALIZED TRUST
AB This article is focused on analyzing dynamics of levels and issues of developing trust within modern Russian society, based on data from the RLMS-HSE. The main objective was evaluating peculiarities in the formation and distribution of generalized trust, which have been observed throughout the last decade of crisis. While performing the analysis, certain new positive shifts were revealed in levels of generalized trust, which have been observed within various socio-demographic groups, despite an increase in uncertainty in all areas of social life. The authors emphasize factors which contribute to and hinder the spread of trust. It is stressed that the most critical factor which contributes to Russian people's increasing trust towards others is an increased sense of personal security. Analyzing a vast range of empirical data leads to the belief that generalized trust appears to be the most important condition necessary for consolidating the foundations of democratic life and further developing civil society. However, participating in the activities of democratic institutions and voluntary organizations of civil society do not necessarily become a source of increased trust towards other people.

AB In the focus of this article is one of the main directions of topical philosophy - posthumanism. The author distinguishes it from the concept of "transhumanism" and traces its origin, development and current state. If posthumanism was originally concerned with culture (the concept of Ihab Hassan's criticism), then later he adressed a new ontology. At this point posthumanism approaches such areas of modern philosophy and social theory as actor-network theory and object-oriented ontology. From the last two posthumanism differs in not being satisfied only with the new ontology, which proposes to move away from the traditional anthropocentric concepts such as "man" and turn to "individuals", and offers an ethical and political program (Donna Haraway, Rosi Braidotti). The author comes to the conclusion that posthumanism is an alternative to cultural postmodernism, which excluded nature from the object of its attention. Posthumanists insist that the concepts of culture and nature should be reconsidered. In this sense, posthumanism can be considered as one of the versions of "postmodernism". However, many researchers in the XXI century, referring to posthumanism, describe it directly through the products of popular culture, thereby weakening the program of posthumanism. But, despite this, the emphasis on the era of "anthropocene" allows posthumanism to abandon postmodern as a historical category, that is involved exactly in culture, and move to the discussion of completely new topics such as ecology, earth, etc.

AB The article discusses the issues that arise at various interpretations of the terms 'inclusion' and 'inclusive education' and in assessing the inclusive process from the point of view of the requirements of quality education, which leads to different consequences not only for the methodology of scientific research, but also for political decisions and educational practice.The analysis of scientific approaches and international regulatory documents shows that opposing inclusive education to special education in linear logic outside the context of the education system development results in the denial of the resourcefulness of special education for inclusion.The article explores the key principles underlying the idea of inclusion and the practice of inclusive education, and it is shown that these principles do not interfere with the application of approaches and methods of special education both in joint and, if necessary, separate education.The potential of inclusive education in reforming the entire educational system, including special education and the training of teachers and other specialists, is also considered.

AB This article is devoted to the study of images of authorities during a new stage in the development of the Russian political system, which began after the presidential elections in 2018. The article is based on the research project implemented at the Department of Sociology and Psychology of Politics, Faculty of Political Science of the Lomonosov Moscow State University. The research methodology included surveys, in-depth interviews, as well as projective tests. The interpretation of the results was carried out using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Having theoretically substantiated the direction of the analysis, the authors focused on the objective, subjective, and temporal factors of political perception.
   The article analyzes cognitive and emotional, visual and verbal components of the image of authorities. The authors described in detail the context of the perception of authorities that changed after the 2018 presidential elections, which led to an alteration of the mass consciousness of the Russian citizens. The psychological characteristics of Russians that affect their perception of authorities are revealed.
   The study conducted by the authors indicates volatility of the psychological state of the Russian society, which is fraught with increased instability in political life, which may result in both increased political apathy and cynicism, as well as increased protest sentiments. There is a request for democratization, participation and closer interactions with the authorities in the Russian society. Since the authorities fail to handle this request, they lose people's trust. The recent shifts in mass consciousness are caused both by the political context and deeper processes associated with the generational change and resocialization.

ID BANK RUNS; DISCIPLINE; LEGACY
AB The case of deposit insurance introduction in Russia may suggest that institutional change in transition economies was partly driven by subjective factors, and the choice of imported institutions was rather random. The circumstances under which explicit deposit insurance emerged in Russia might explain its subsequent (mal-)functioning and social costs. Material and institutional pre-conditions were missing at the time the topic of deposit guaranteeing came up in the parliament. The key actors (large banks controlling most household deposits and their depositors) did not demand hard a formal scheme of deposit protection. The advantage of an explicit protection scheme over the existing implicit one was unclear because of the prevalence of state-owned banks. I suggest that the introduction of deposit insurance was driven by a combination of factors such as: genuine good intentions of its proponents; demonstration effect of western experiences; the desire to disrupt the monopoly of Sberbank and boost the competitiveness of privately-owned commercial banks, probably stemming from ideological bias in favor of private ownership; and, last but not least, search for a new field of activity for deposit insurance initiators themselves. Despite the random selection, the institution of deposit guaranteeing fit well in the Russian setup because it was consistent with the long tradition of state paternalism.

DE native language; the Komi-Zyryans; Russian Orthodox; religious practices
AB Introduction. Over recent decades we can observe an increase of the interest of people, researchers and politicians in the field of ethno-religious problematics, especially in the context of study of religion's role in the cultural identity of Finno-Ugric people living in the Russian Federation. Much attention is paid to such problems as the influence of the Orthodox tradition on the culture of Finno-Ugric people, its interaction with traditional religious beliefs and their mutual influence; missionary and translational activities of the Orthodox Church, its influence on the formation of the national intelligentsia and literary languages. The article is devoted to the study of the significance of Orthodox worship and education in native languages for ordinary believers, the influence of the language environment on the formation of local religious practices among the Komi-Zyryans.
   Objective: to study the role of the Komi-Zyryan language in the Orthodox religious practices during 1900-1930 at institutional and individual levels.
   Research materials: the article based on archival and published documents: reports of Orthodox congregations (Brotherhoods) and missionary societies, files from Vologda spiritual consistory; reports prepared by Joint State Political Directorate during 1920s; ego-documents.
   Results and novelty of the research. The article considers the influence of the Komi language on the formation of Orthodox religious practices of the first third of the XX century. Analysis of published and archival documents allows us drawing conclusions about the decisive importance of language both for the activities of the parish clergy and old believers' leaders and for the religious life of the Komi peasantry.

DT Article
DE institutional economics; professional dynasties; natural state; crony
   capitalism; special interest groups; institutional rent
AB Dynasties matter as a factor affecting social and economic development in various social orders. In the framework of this article, professional dynasties are considered as an institution that structures interactions associated with professional activities, the reproduction of human and social capital based on kinship, and group identity. The constructive or destructive influence of dynasties on social-economic development depends on the type of capitalism and its institutional structure. Social orders in this paper are considered through the prism of the natural state evolution concept. Among the forms of capitalism related to a natural state are considered: political, public, crony capitalism, and the economic order of modern mercantilism. Crony capitalism as a form of social order has developed due to the specific features of the institutional environment - a low intergroup trust level and trust in social institutions. Crony capitalism describes an economic system in which the government controls the economy with deformed market institutions, through support to different types of monopoly to provide the dominant groups with the institutional rent. In those conditions, the professional dynasties as a social institution implies activities of special interest groups which exist due to strong family ties and benefit from the institutional rent. The groups that make up professional dynasties, explicitly or implicitly, seek to create and maintain local professional and administrative monopolies. Constructive approach, in turn, treats professional dynasties as the channels to transfer and preserve the human capital in specific areas, related to culture and generation of the new knowledge, which do not imply significant institutional rent. Under Russian conditions, the problem of the institution dynasties acquires significance as a reflection of institutional inertia in the crony capitalism evolution, which ensures the stability and continuity between the elites.

ID YABLOS PARADOX; SELF-REFERENCE
AB Three epistemic puzzles are analyzed in the article: the puzzle discovered by Williamson (the puzzle of visual measurement), Fitch's paradox (the paradox of knowability), and the surprise exam paradox. It is demonstrated that an essential part of each of them is the assumption that agents can have negative reflexive knowledge, i.e. knowledge of one's own ignorance. In Williamson's scenario, an agent tries to visually estimate how tall a tree is. Negative reflexive knowledge ascribed to the agent in the scenario is to the effect that he knows that, for any natural n, if the tree is n inches tall then he does not know that it is n - 1 inches tall. In Fitch's setting, the possibility of knowing one's own not-knowing a state of affairs is considered. Finally, in various versions of the surprise event puzzle (such as the surprise exam puzzle), it is presupposed that people expect an event but know that, a day before the event, they will not know that it is going to take place next day. These observations can be generalized to the claim that negative reflexive knowledge formally, assumptions of the form ...K(...K...) - are an essential part of many (if not all) epistemic puzzles. It is shown that negative reflexive knowledge plays the same role in epistemic puzzles as alethically negative self-reference plays in semantic paradoxes, namely the Liar paradox and Yablo's paradox (the latter is taken in the interpretation proposed by Priest). Alethically negative self-reference is the fact that paradoxical sentences ascribe to themselves the property of being untrue. Both negative reflexive knowledge and alethically negative self-reference, produce (within relevant settings) unwelcome effects: paradoxicality in semantic paradoxes and counter-intuitive consequences in epistemic puzzles.

AB The paper evaluates Russia's increased naval presence in the Asian-Pacific region, considering the naval interactions with China, India, Vietnam, the Philippines etc., an important component of Russia's national strategy and maritime policy in the region. By strengthening cooperation with the navies of these countries in different parts of the world, Moscow demonstrates its political preferences and military capabilities by checking the combat readiness of its own Navy, as well as modernizing its strategy and tactics, taking into account the modern experience of combat operations among the other fleets. It then presents a valuable opportunity for Russia to defend its national interests while remaining a non-aligned and predictable actor. By analyzing the dynamics, metrics and substance of Russia's naval activities, the author tries to clarify the strategic goals of the Russian and other countries' navies, and also to define some qualitative characteristics, such as the level of interaction between the Russian Navy and each of its partners, operational tasks of the exercises, etc. In addition, Russia's joint maneuvers not only maintain its status as a great maritime power and raises its international authority but also may serve as a balancing factor for the U.S. and Chinese navies to improve the security situation in the Asia-Pacific.

AB The article makes an analytical review of approaches to creating ultra-radical communities identifying tools for social media. The formulation of the radicalization process, as a transition from nonviolent forms of expression to violent actions, is indicated. Radicals should be seen as committed to decisive action, which may not be extreme. Extremists should be considered as supporters of using extreme means to achieve their goals, even if it is possible to achieve the goal legally, without using violence. Terrorists are those who use ideologically motivated violence. The measure of the legal assessment of the actions of each category is the assessment of the level of danger of the methods they use for society and the state. The prefix "ultra" means that the radicals accept the idea that violence is necessary to advance an ideological goal. They justify, propagandize this idea, express readiness to proceed to violent actions, and also undertake a moral obligation in defense of groups that promote this idea. Key characteristics and ideological platforms of ultra-right extremist communities, threats and risks of online radicalization are described. The fundamental idea of ultra-right communities is the belief in the superiority of some individuals and groups and the inferiority of others. It emphasizes the importance of software algorithms that allow diagnosing various kinds of threats in the information space with high speed. Creation of new technologies for the identification of extremist communities in social media is possible in interdisciplinary research teams consisting of sociologists, computer science specialists, linguists, psychologists, criminologists. The "background characteristics" and "background analytics" are used as the basis for creating software algorithms. Problems with the creation of research tools and services are indicated, the authors' classification and description of the strengths and weaknesses of approaches to create tools for identifying extremist communities are given. The following categories are indicated: autonomous, additive, hybrid, multi-level. A description of the authors' method of calendar-correlation analysis is proposed for detecting the target ultra-radical group on the characteristic change in the group's activity in the "neighborhood" of key events. Currently, the team of authors is testing the prototype.

TI Ecological Organisations in the Post-Soviet States as a Tool for Meeting
   Environmental Challenges (Based on the Example of the Russian Federation
   and the Ukraine)
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE state and environmental science; environmental organisations of the
   post-Soviet space; environmental problems and challenges
AB The aim of the study was to analyse the key historical milestones of the development of environmental organisations in the post-Soviet states based on the example of the Russian Federation and Ukraine, which influenced the modern dynamics of the development of environmentalism. The sources for the study are statistical data from the official websites of the bodies of authority (Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation), results of sociological surveys of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and the Higher School of Economics, data presented on the official websites of environmental organisations in Russia and Ukraine. The use of historical, systematic and institutional approaches allowed identifying the causes of emergence, the main problems and features of environmental organisations' development. The main reason for environmental organisations' emergence in the Russian Federation and in Ukraine was the environmental disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, which contributed to the development of environmentalism and at the same time showed its extremely weak positions in terms of creating political parties and participating in policy- making. Among the range of problems, the author of the study focuses on the lack of funding sources and difficulties in the interaction with representatives of various levels of government. Particular attention is paid to the specific features of Russian and Ukrainian environmental movements. Similar features of their environmentalism include the insufficiently effective model of interaction between national and regional organisations, the already formed environmental consciousness of the population. At the same time, the point of difference between the ecological organisations of Russia and Ukraine is different models of interaction with the authorities. In the Russian Federation, a model of active state intervention in the legislative process has been developed. This is reflected in the limited impact of environmentalists on decision-making and the strict control of the state through the regulatory and legal acts on the issues of environmental organisations' accountability and funding. Ukraine has developed a moderate model of state intervention in the legislative process: the state actively supports environmentalists' initiatives and the establishment of new public organisations. Summing up, the author notes that the identified similarities and difference between the environmentalists of Russia and Ukraine, however, do not have a significant impact on the importance of reducing environmental threats and the importance of solving environmental problems. It is necessary to continue work on improving the regulatory framework, to promote the expansion of opportunities for public activists to influence political decision-making, to form mechanisms for civic participation to involve the population at large in solving environmental problems.

ID INNOVATION; CRISIS; MARKET; HELIX
AB The knowledge economy has come a long way before becoming one of the fundamental concepts in scientific and political discourse. The World Bank and the OECD analyze the level of development of the knowledge economy at the global level. However, the transformation of the economy at the regional level is also very important, largely because of the general tendency towards regionalization. This issue is particularly acute for emerging and post-communist countries (including Russia), which are in the process of transition to a market economy. Grounding on the World Bank's Knowledge Economy Index indicators, the authors developed the Russian Regional Knowledge Economy Index (Russian RKEI). The authors allocated the leading and lagging groups of regions regarding the knowledge economy development as well as the fastest-growing regions. The authors identified critical success factors in the modernization of regional economic systems. Besides, the authors marked the negative trend in the development of the knowledge economy in more than half of Russian regions. On the one hand, this is due to the economic crisis and a reduction in investment; on the other hand, institutional problems continue to restrain economic development. The results can be used in further theoretical and applied studies for both Russia and other transition economies.

This includes changes in the balance between Pro-European and Eurosceptic forces and its impact on the future of the EU itself Based on the results of the elections and the results of the appointment of the new European Commission leadership (the European Parliament and the European Council), the author concludes that, although at the moment the Pro-European forces retain their dominant position in the leading political institutions of the EU, the dissatisfaction of a large part of citizens in the EU member States with the undemocratic and non-transparent formation and operation of the EU institutions persists, and even grows in a number of leading countries (Germany, Italy, France, etc.), this in the future may threaten the stability and efficiency of the EU functioning.

DT Article
DE the UK; Scotland; Brexit; separatism; the Conservative Party; the
   Scottish National Party
AB The article analyzes the political aspects of the independence movement that the Scottish government led by Nicola Sturgeon organized in response to the idea of the UK withdrawal from the EU. The background of Scottish separatism and the negative economic consequences for the region in case of its separation are considered. Scotland plans to hold a new independence referendum until 2021, and according to opinion polls, the proportion of those ready to support leaving the United Kingdom is growing steadily, especially in view of the struggle of PM Boris Johnson with the UK parliament. Under the 1998 Scotland Act, which legislated devolution in the region, local governments pledged to be responsible for complying with the EU standards in the areas of economic development, the rule of law, local governance, fisheries and agriculture, environmental protection, transport and climate change. Close cooperation between Scotland and the EU has contributed to the fact that the region receives investments from the European Union to develop university education, healthcare, small and medium-sized businesses support and employment programs, while representatives of the region are actively involved in the work of the European Parliament. The risk of losing previous economic and political ties with the EU in view of Brexit has reinforced centrifugal tendencies again, putting the independence of Scotland at the top of the agenda of the ruling Scottish National Party.

AB The article analyzes the trends emerging in the framework of the World Climate Agenda. The Genesis of the Climate Agenda is described, the degree of its relevance to the real climate problem is revealed. The author studies the regularity of the transition in global priorities from substantial environmental issues to the emphasis on virtual threats, which are hypothetical in nature, but formulated in the form of categorical imperatives of immediate action. The analysis reveals general functionality of the Climate Agenda from the point of view of ensuring the interests of the leading world powers. The political, economic and social potential of the Climate Agenda, its main beneficiaries, performers and ways of implementation in the world community are analyzed. Economic motives and basic financial schemes that support the interest of world players in the promotion of the Agenda are defined. Particular attention is paid to the risks arising under this agenda for the national sovereignty of countries and methods of erosion of this sovereignty at the global level, including the UN Paris Climate Agreement. Global climate constructions are evaluated from the viewpoint of the Energy Security Doctrine of the Russian Federation approved by the President of the Russian Federation.

AB The Russian government has programs to assist Russian companies with financial and organizational support. Award of procurement contracts may also serve as assistance to companies. This paper uses data from a survey of Russian companies to draw inferences about the motivation behind the choice of recipients. Possible motivations are an intent to foster economic development, successful rent-seeking by recipients or simply corruption. The evidence is mixed. There is support for both the economic development motive and rent-seeking in the analysis of financial and organizational support. A role for corruption is most evident in the procurement contract results.

DE Russia; peace initiatives; the Gulf; the Middle East and North Africa;
   conflict resolution
AB Russia's recent thundering 'return' to the Middle East is first and foremost an obvious result of the effective use of hard power, rather than the tools of soft power such as economics or diplomacy, which played important but secondary roles. The most visible symbol of this return is the establishment of two permanent sovereign Russian military bases in Syria. Indeed, Moscow has extensive experience in employing hard power to protect its interests, but political, financial and security costs and risks of its application are aplenty, which will dictate Russia's more cautious policy on this matter in the future. Having gained a military foothold in the region, Russia now seeks to augment its influence in the MENA region further, and increasingly through the use of soft power, particularly diplomatic initiatives. The Astana-Sochi process is the format that Russia has moulded for this purpose. The study seeks to provide, first, an analysis of the Astana-Sochi process for Syria, its theoretical foundations and practical implementations, evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses, and then explore its applicability in the MENA region considering both objective features of the format and more subjective implications of the wider Russian involvement in the region against the backdrop of rising tensions between Moscow and the West.

AB To illustrate the role of organizations of lawyers in social changes we analyze the process of transforming legal and socio-political institutions in Russia over the past 30 years. We combine the theory of legal mobilization with the concept of violence and social orders proposed by North, Wallis and Weingast to describe the general logic of this process. Russian case shows that exogenous shocks stimulate collective action of criminal defence lawyers which, in turn, compel the government to respond. The state can promote the passivity of the legal community and stop legal mobilization by providing certain preferences for the profession. Even though in the 2000s, Russia took the path of destroying legal institutions, legal profession in certain circumstances could again act as an agent of social change. We conclude that the efficiency of collective action depends on the institutional capacity of legal association and on the position of the professional elite standing at its head.

AB Currently, the main source for the reconstruction of the most ancient history of humankind is archeology, which almost by definition makes it possible to restore only just a few elements of the most ancient human culture (naturally, almost exclusively - material culture). A mere introduction of comparative linguistic data makes it possible to significantly refine our reconstruction of a respective culture. If a certain linguistic Urheimat may be localized in space and in time within the area and lifespan of a certain archaeological culture, this suggests that we may have an idea of the language spoken by respective population, as the application of comparative linguistic methods allows us to reconstruct the vocabulary of the carriers of the respective protolanguage, that makes it possible to identify a set of terms denoting the realities of family organization, political attitudes, beliefs, etc. A very important part of the reconstructed vocabulary is constituted by the kinship terminology. As is well known (and as is demonstrated in this article again), the kinship terminology displays rather strong correlations with respective types of kinship organization, which could allow to reconstruct important features of clan and family structure of the respective populations. This reconstruction can be further verified by using archaeological and genetic data. It is demonstrated that the papers presented at the International Workshop 'Murdock and Goody Re-visited: (Pre)history and evolution of Eurasian and African family systems' that was organized in April 2015 by the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology suggest that we are close to having all the necessary ingredients to undertake such a program of a deep historical reconstruction.

TI FIGHT "FOR" AND "AGAINST" IDENTITY IN INNER POLITICAL PROCESSES: A
   CONFLICT between "NEW LIBERALS" and TRADITIONALISTS

DT Article
DE liberalism; traditionalism; antitraditionalism; problems of indentity;
   nationalism; right populism; gender problems
AB The article analyzes the withstanding of two worldviews - traditionalism and antitraditionalism - in the context of the conflict between the "right populism" and the modern liberalism. The authors define the ideology of the modern liberal order as antitraditionalism because it differs from the classical liberalism and should not be mixed with neoliberalism. Its basic feature is the intention to overcome every identity, because the identity, according to the antitraditionalist ideology, chains humans with narrow frames of stereotypes imposed from outside. The overcoming of identity opens the world of new possibilities and new values. In the chapter on the basics of antitraditionalism, the authors distinguish two ideological sources of this worldview. Firstly, it is Christianity that claims the principles of equality. The second source is Marxism where "being defines conscience", and both the "discriminated conscience of the exploited" and the "suppressing conscience of the dominating class" exist. The progress of the new ideology is described in the chapter on the revolution of antitraditionalism. The influence of the struggle between two trends on inner political processes is analyzed in the chapter on the party delimitations and political discussions. It is stressed that Russia was a pioneer of antitraditionalism in the Soviet period but now counters the new "liberal" values. The traditionalist wave in Europe and USA was provoked by immigration crisis, discussion around issues of gender and perception of nationalism. The authors conclude that the beginning of a new ideological and political fight in the modern world as well as the occurrence of the traditionalist reaction to a peaceful antitraditionalist revolution (which has been taking place since the second half of 20th century) is a regular process.

   War Victims
AB During WWI, prisoners of war representing different states and nations were held in concentration camps in Siberia. The Provisional Siberian Government, Komuch (The Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly) and the Russian Government of A.V. Kolchak applied the principle of "ethnicization" and were dividing the prisoners of war into "allied" (Slays and others) and "hostile" (Germans, Magyars, etc.), following the policy pursued by Russian authorities since the beginning of the war. The Slavic and Romanesque prisoners of war were held in special national camps with the right to enter national armies. However, national organisations not only formed military units, but also excersised the consular functions to represent prisoners of war, refugees and displaced peasants, which entailed conflicts among prisoners of war due to their different state and national-political identification. There was a struggle for the right to represent the interests of the natives of Subcarpathian Rus between the Central Carpathians Council (CCC), which aligned with Russia and therefore was supported by the Kotchak administration, and, on the other hand, the Omsk Branch of the Galician-Bukovinian Committee of Assisting War Victims, which assisted to the prisoners of war from Galicia and Bukovina and formed Ukrainian military units.As a resutt,the Galician-Bukovinian Committee was disbanded, white the CCC was granted the '`exclusive right" to register the natives of Subcarpathian Rus. They could also form military units for the Kotchak army and represent the interests of Carpathians at the Paris Conference. Thus, the policy of "ethnicization" and division of prisoners of war into "hostile" and "allied" resulted in a split among the prisoners of war and undermined the unity of Anti-Bolshevik front and decreased the chances to achieve the strategic goat of the Russian governments, which was the victory over Bolshevism and re-establishment of the one and undivided Russia.

TI Japanese Regionalism IN the Era of Shinzo Abe Through the Pr ism of
   Value Approach

LA Russian
DT Article
DE East Asia; Shinzo Abe; Japan; open regionalism; "Asian values"; "Arc of
   freedom and prosperity"; like-minded democracies; "free and open
   Indo-Pacific region"
AB The article analyzes the value component of Japan's approach to East Asian regionalism in the period of Shinzo Abe's cabinets. After the end of the Cold War, Japan has taken several institution-building initiatives in the sphere of multilateral regional cooperation in East Asia, including ASEAN plus Six, East Asian summit, TPPCP, etc. All these institutions had different underpinning in terms of their origin, structure, membership or functional mission. Yet, a characteristic feature of Japan's approach to East Asian regionalism lies in its "value orientation". Abe became the first Japanese leader after Koizumi to widely use the rhetoric of "democratic values" for substantiating Japan's formula of institutional up-building in East Asia. Japan's vision of "open regionalism" is based on the principles of democracy, mutual trust, transparency and inclusiveness. A special emphasis is put on the principle of functional relevance, which in the eyes of Tokyo should be indispensable for combating non-traditional threats, promoting economic development, expanding cooperation to different areas such as health, environment, finance, etc. The functionality of such cooperation should be provided by the spillover effect. The value-based approach adopted by Japan in reality was intended to "dilute" China's influence in the multilateral regional structures through the admission of new "like-minded" members, such as India, Australia and New Zealand, which shared liberal economic values and were faithful to the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law (like Japan). The Japanese vision of regionalism, from the value point, does not constitute a coherent doctrine, because of the mutual incompatibility of different values accentuated in Tokyo's rhetoric. For example, Abe's phraseology combines "universal" and "Asian" values, open and closed regionalism, future-oriented approach to regional relations, the desire "to draw a line" under Japan's post-war past, etc. Yet, skillful combination of these slogans in Abe's rhetoric gives him an additional diplomatic leverage against China, as many of Japan's Asian neighbors are wary of the phenomenon of "China rise". While remaining on the same side of the barricades with the United States in the paradigm of the "new bipolarity in Asia", Japan relishes a freedom of maneuver for putting forward various political initiatives in East Asia and even providing a counterweight to Washington.

DT Article
AB The reconstruction of the ancient nomads' social organization based on archaeological materials reveals a number of objective difficulties. However, mass material evidence and developed methodological approaches allow, based on the experience of predecessors, presenting the level of the social complexity. The reflection of this situation is demonstrated by the history of studying the world famous Pazyryk culture. A substantial amount of objective information allowed the authors of the article to consistently solve problems of social interpretation of the existing data set and consider the consistency of the selected signs of statehood in relation to the unification of the Altai nomads in the Scythian-Saka time. Based on the several basic indicators (spatial-territorial-geographical factor; population size and density; economic and cultural types; craft activity; presence of large population consolidation centers; social stratification (including management apparatus), taxation; foreign policy contacts, sign-communicative system; worldview, etc.) it is concluded that the population of the Pazyryk were in the process of socio-political complexity formation of the indicated level.

DE ballistic missile defense systems; ballistic missiles intercept systems;

   defenses; START negotiations
AB For many decades, in terms of strategic stability, ballistic missile defense systems developed and deployed by the Soviet Union/Russia and the United States have been seen as potentially destabilizing. However, although significant technological progress has been achieved in creating ballistic missile interception systems and global information network, over 60 years of experience in the development and flight testing have confirmed the impossibility of protecting the countries' territory from massive nuclear strikes. It is possible to intercept only a single missile or an extremely small number of them. An objective analysis of the state and effectiveness of existing and potential future characteristics of missile defense systems suggests that their impact on the nuclear deterrence capability of Russia and the United States is virtually absent and does not hinder the negotiation processes aimed at limiting strategic of fensive arms. That being said, missile defense systems have a potential to significantly affect regional stability and, depending on the situation, have both stabilizing and destabilizing effect on the military and political landscape. It is therefore incumbent upon the UN Security Council and other international organizations to continuously monitor regional stability in order to be able to react promptly and prevent negative development of the situation.

AB This article considers the "territoriality" of civic institutions. Is the "frontier thesis" - according to which areas of new settlement exhibit higher levels of individualism, political activism, and civic organisation - a description only of the western United States, or is it a manifestation of a more generalisable phenomenon found in other global frontier regions? In order to do this, we examine data on the nature of civic institutions in frontier zones in four countries: Brazil, Russia, Canada and the USA. Taking a wide range of survey items, we find that voluntary activity, social trust, tolerance of outgroups, and civic protest are not unique to the American historical experience, but generalised legacies of frontier life. We suggest that the experience of settlement is conducive to the formation of norms of community solidarity and cooperation, and this observation should encourage a new wave of comparative frontier studies.

DE paradox; contradiction; self-reference; truth; Liar; Yablo; Priest;
   Bueno; Colyvan; Borisov
AB The concept of paradox is discussed in the article. A distinction between a strict paradox and a non-strict paradox is made. The author formulates the non-strict finite liar paradox. This paradox is not self-referential, since no sentence in its formulation refers to itself. The result of the research can be considered as a critical argument in relation to the classical method of solving paradoxes which implies a ban on self-reference. A hierarchical approach to solving paradoxes going back to the studies of Bertrand Russell and Alfred Tarski suggested a complete blocking of self-reference in order to prevent the possibility of contradictions in thinking and in language. Russell and Tarski regarded self-reference as the reason for the formation of any paradoxes containing contradictions. Accordingly, using a hierarchical approach, it was possible to solve not only strict paradoxes such as the Russell paradox but also non-strict paradoxes such as the Epimenides (the classical liar) paradox because, as it was supposed, the prohibition on self reference would block even the likely appearance of contradictions. A non-strict liar without self-reference formulated in this article cannot be resolved with the help of Russell's and Tarski's hierarchical approach by imposing a ban on self-reference since no sentence in this paradox refers to itself.

DT Article
DE political construction of reality; media reality; political
   communication; political socialization
AB The author's theory, continuing the tradition of social phenomenology, addresses political phenomena and emphasizes that reality is politically constructed. It means that the political power has a creative potential and acts as a constructor of reality. However, political power requires the media; therefore, the communicative aspect begins to play not only a connecting role but also an essential one. Political being depends on sign exchange: the political world is perceived as a subjective semantic world, secondary socialization is organized in the form of inclusion of symbolic meanings into the world of an individual, the political power is maintained as a communicative construct, etc. More importantly, one constructs a politically legitimate world, in which it is the "correct" political reality that becomes a world which "means". According to the theory of the political construction of reality, communication should be understood phenomenologically - it is the political power that is concerned about understanding meanings and that offers interpretative frames. Based on the political-constructivist scientific approach the author developed, a political media reality is defined in the article. Firstly, it is an artificial mediator between a person and political institutions. The person perceives media images and completed political constructions, discovers, evaluates and represents the political order. Therefore, a media reality is both a reality created by the media and a medium. Secondly, this is a sign and symbolic space, it was politically and purposefully developed to affect the political consciousness of society. The influence lies in the fact that this reality is perceived as the actual reality. The term "media reality" means the quality of being inherent in the media phenomena. Thirdly, a media reality simulates, virtualizes and acts as a kind of a hyperreality, without representing authentic being. Political power as a mediacracy constructs a political media reality through modeling. In this reality, the archetype and the proto-model is a mythic-and-heroic scheme that determines the main political roles, the hero and the antagonist, sets the scenario (the hero's path and the punishment of evil), develops the essence of the political reality starting with the making of the image of the foe. The myth model relates to the media agenda model that contributes to the development of nodes in political communication (these nodes allow discussing "topics" and forming "public"). However, the postmodern political communication forms a "new media reality", a certain cult of communication regardless of semantic consensus. Politics is deconstructed: semantic frames do not find an adequate replacement and signs are not re-signified. Currently, a discussion of political brands provides a communication alternative to the erosion of meanings.

DE structure of science; disciplinarity; interdisciplinarity;
   transdisciplinarity; technoscience; methodology of complexity cognition
AB The article analyses the structural changes in the contemporary science and research methodologies at the new stage of social dynamics and in connection with the development of a new scientific paradigm - technoscience. Significant changes in the contemporary science are characterized as a shift of the scientific rationality paradigms. The observed changes involve both substantive and structural aspects of scientific knowledge. It is shown that disciplinarity, interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity are forms of the structural organization of knowledge associated respectively with the classical, non-classical and post-non-classical paradigms of scientificity. Within the framework of the classical paradigm, scientific knowledge is disciplinarily structured. In the non-classical paradigm within the structure of science, an independent layer of knowledge is designated - interdisciplinary knowledge. Informatics, general theory of systems, cybernetics, synergetics have an interdisciplinary status. The post-non-classical paradigm of science corresponds to a new level of knowledge integration - transdisciplinarity. The development of science is also characterized by changes in the methodological research strategies in the three considered paradigms of science. The classical methodology of science sought to combine knowledge about activity and thinking with knowledge about the objects of this activity and thinking. In disciplinarily structured scientific knowledge and in interdisciplinary research, the horizontal movement of thought in the plane of the object is maintained, despite the extensive expansion of boundaries and connection between the disciplines. The methodology of interdisciplinary research can be characterized as uncovering the horizontal connections of reality. When human-dimension systems become the subject of cognition, parameters that characterize not only the object, but also the sphere of its social functioning are included in the constructed model of reality. It is post-non-classical rationality that encounters a different type of objectivity (not an objective one), but it affects the human world; therefore, post-non-classical scientificity is associated with a stage defined by the term "technoscience". Technoscience forms a model of interaction between knowledge and society, in which knowledge is socially and practically conditioned, the production of knowledge is provided by the digitalization of science, the coalescence of science and production. Transdisciplinarity entered the practice of science and is particularly relevant in connection with technoscience and convergent technologies. In transdisciplinary studies, the reductionist methodology is complemented by approaches such as holism and emergentism, and cognitive activity is characterized as a complex systemic thinking. The cognition methodology of this kind of reality (complex self-developing systems involving a human) is called the methodology of complexity cognition.

The Dmitry Karamazov case shows that the formal view of the truth suffices for deciding a case, but it cannot prevent judicial errors when the epistemological ideal of the material truth falls into oblivion.

DT Article
DE "soft power" policy; China; Southeast Asia; economic expansion; economic
   dependence; political risks; anti-Chinese sentiments; overseas Chinese
AB The Southeast Asia is of special interest to China and, therefore, attracts its enhanced attention. The countries of the region possess a lot of benefits for the PRC as for sustaining its economic growth and promoting its geopolitical ambitions. To achieve these goals, Beijing has to encourage their support by forming its positive image of a responsible regional actor, which raises the importance of conducting the policy of "soft power" with the aim to raise its attractiveness for them. For this purpose, China combines traditional "soft power" instruments - such as culture, education, values, public diplomacy - with economic resources that can promote its attractiveness the most. The question is to what extent the Chinese "soft power" policy meets the interests of the Southeast Asia countries in achieving their economic prosperity, political stability and guarantying their national security. The point is that these countries alongside with deriving benefits from extended ties with the PRC face considerable risks - economic, political, social and strategic. The economic expansion of China into the region brings not only new investment and increase in trade exchange, but results in losing competiveness by national business, in indebtedness and political dependence, in deteriorating social problems. In countries with authoritarian regimes, the economic rapprochement with the PRC leads to strengthening the political position of existing power, while in democratic countries it causes the increase of anti-Chinese sentiments in society, which is used by opposition forces in a political struggle. Cultural expansion of China for all its positive directions towards improving mutual understanding also leads to implicit political threats coming from Being's attempts to form an "extinctive" elite and increase of anti-Chinese sentiments in local public. The mulls of public opinion polls indicate that the possibility to raise the PRC's attractiveness for the Southeast Asia countries by means of "soft power" resources remains limited. They do not perceive the growth of China's economic power as being solely beneficial for them. And the more Beijing seeks to dominate the region using the tools of "soft power", the stronger will be a public demand for maintaining a distance in relations with it.

DE Mithridates of Pergamum; Caesar; Mithridates Eupator; Deiotarus;
   Bosporus; Galatia; Brogitarus; Adobogiona; Trocmi; Tolistobogii; Egypt;
   Pharnaces; Mithridates III of Bosporus
AB The article offers a comprehensive study of the life and political activity of Mithridates of Pergamum, whose political rise as a friend of Caesar and Rome occurred between the Alexandrian war and the battle at Zela in 47 BC when Caesar fought with Pharnaces II. The chronology of his life can now be constructed more precisely with the help of a golden stater, discovered in the course of archaeological investigations on the site of Artesian in East Crimea. This unique coin was minted at Pergamum and bears a portrait of Mithridates of Pergamum in the image of a Roman noble, his royal title, name and the year Gamma M = 43 = 46 BC which, in the author's view, indicates the Pergamene "liberation" era of Mithridates VI Eupator, used also on the latter's coins struck at Pergamum in 89-85 BC. The use of this era on the coin of Mithridates of Pergamum was motivated by his claim to be a descendant of the great Pontic king. The reverse of the coin with a great deal of probability gives a head of Deiotarus the Elder with lituus, symbol of his interest in the Roman augures. Deiotarus was the predecessor of Mithridates of Pergamum on the throne of the Galatian Trocmi and presumably of the whole Galatia. The year 46 BC - the year of the third consulate of Caesar - is also marked on the coin in the ligature Y Gamma = nu pi alpha tau omicron sigma Gamma, i.e. "consul for the third time". In 46 BC the Roman dictator proclaimed Mithridates the king of the Trocmi (and arguably of the whole Galatia), and the king of Bosporus and other countries (evidently the part of the coast between Pharnacia and Trapezous along with Colchis) and gave him an opportunity to start a campaign against Asander who usurped power in Bosporus in 47 BC. The date on Mithridates' commemorative coin - 46 BC - allows to establish the date of this military venture, defeat and death of Mithridates of Pergamum more precisely: it happened not earlier than the late 46 - early 45 BC. After his victory, probably in a sea battle, Asander started minting coins with naval symbols in commemoration of his victory over Mithridates, while Caesar had refused to recognize him as king of Bosporus.

AB The author explores the progress and results of the parliamentary elections in Sweden, which took place in September 2018. However, the government was formed only after more than four months - an unprecedented fact for this country. The forces of the political blocs were almost equal (144 deputies of the Red-green bloc and 143 of the bourgeois Alliance). The third force was the nationalist party of the Swedish Democrats, which strengthened its position. Unlike other Nordic countries, both blocs refused to cooperate with this party, trying to create new coalitions. The article considers drama of negotiations, the reasons for the split of both blocs, the forced collaboration of Social Democrats with the centrist parties and the refusal to cooperate with the Left party, the transition of the Moderate coalition party and Christian Democrats to the opposition.

DE thinking; process; structure; creativity; communication; activity;
   abstract thinking; objective thinking; reflection
AB In the introduction part of the article, the authors give a proof of the issue's topicality, defines the aim and formulates the problem of the research. During the preparation of this article, methods of analyzing and synthesizing information from open sources, including articles of the national and foreign experts in the field of philosophy of creativity and methodology of thinking, were used. To determine the relationship between creativity and thinking, and to substantiate a philosophical understanding of thinking, the result of which is a unique product necessary for society, the authors give a categorical characteristic of thinking and denotes its ontological principles. Solving a problem is a thinking process. Consequently, the study of problem solving processes largely coincides with the study of mental processes. The essence of mental activity is to reflect the essential properties and relationships of things. The authors do not deal with numerous and diverse studies of such entities as reasoning, which is not always the essence of problem solving, as well as rational dispute. Problem solving involves thinking as a practical activity aimed at achieving specific goals set within the framework of a problem situation. Actual thinking is like an ideal world, a "private form" of thinking, subject to the laws of logic, and expressed in symbols (charts, tables, graphs, etc.). In the main part of the article, the authors reveal the relationship of thinking and creativity in the process of solving problems through such categories of thinking as process and structure. Thinking as a process is ontologically characterized in the context of an act of communication and in the context of activity. From the position of communication, thinking acts as an operational objective selection or creation of content and its expression (or fixation) in the simultaneously and parallelly created sign form of the text. Thinking in the communicative aspect is focused on the creation of ideal entities through language and symbols. The authors consider thinking as a process in terms of activity in the context of problem solving. Such mental activity is formed on the basis of practical, objective activity. Thinking, which results in a creative product, involves the reflection of the diverse properties of objects. This is confirmed by the abundance of "big ideas" at the generation stage. Particular emphasis in studies of thinking as an activity is made on the processes of substitution. As for the process itself, the formation of a communication idea, or a "big idea", is carried out in several stages: focusing, processing, selection and evaluation. The fundamental difference of the thinking process, as a result of which new unique products are created, is that, at the first stage, the focus is not so much on the object (context, assessment of current barriers), but on the person's attitude to the object (functional and semantic load). Moreover, at this stage, abstract ideas are formulated rather than objective ones.
   When problem situations arise that require resolution, a certain pattern of mental actions is built, as a rule. Namely, it is necessary to get answers to the questions of how these situations are realized as "task-oriented", and which means and systems of co-activities ensure the transfer of means and the whole experience of solving problems to new situations. How, in fact, can the transition from an abstract and conceptual representation of the whole to an objective one go given that it is generally during this period of transition that the above-mentioned shift occurs, and the connection between abstract and objective thinking becomes elusive? According to the author, reflection becomes such a connecting element. On the one hand, reflection is associated with abstract thinking. On the other hand, by organizing our space and time, by defining the structure of our vital activity, reflection is extremely concrete and directed to the objective world. The meanings of the ideal world exist eternally and are not subject to change, they are a kind of ideal categories, whereas meanings of the objective world are meanings of a physical reality, with their own physical laws, time and space. In turn, transition between the practical activity of thinking and the field of ideal thinking is possible, because thanks to this a new idea is formed. On the one hand, there are provocations and paradoxes, modeling the situation and going beyond. On the other hand, there are barriers, norms, regulations. The result is an opportunity to get a new unique product. The qualitative characteristics of thinking are complemented by elements of creativity, which are revealed at the level of the expansion of cultural senses and their focus, analysis, generation and filtering in the field of objective and ideal activity. The phenomenon of creativity is closely intertwined with the concept of reflection in a broad sense as the ability of natural thinking, especially in the transition from objective to abstract thinking. From the position of structure, the relationship of thinking and creativity is determined based on the types of problem solving and depends on the subjective abilities of individuals, their knowledge and skills, which lead to the emergence of a new composition of activities, and, in our case, to a new unique product corresponding to the spirit of the times. At the end of the article, the authors summarize the findings and makes conclusions.

TI NEW STAGE IN CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT AMID THE "TRADE WAR" WITH THE U.S.
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE world economy; China; USA; "trade wars"; foreign policy
AB By the middle of 2018, there are signs of China's entry into a new period of development, characterized by alteration of the old model "market reforms - intraparty democratization - moderate foreign policy" to another: "market reforms - Xi Jinping personality cult - offensive foreign policy". The latter contains a risk of the arising contradiction between economic freedom and political-ideological rigidity, which can lead to destabilization of political life. However, in the light of the current positive economic dynamics, such risk may rather come out in the mid-and long-term perspective. Today, the political situation in China remains stable - despite growing dissatisfaction in scientific, expert and educational circles - due to a tightened control over the intellectual sphere by the government. The need for a new redistribution of power between central and provincial authorities could potentially disrupt political stability in the medium term, but, at the moment, is not a critical negative factor. The economic situation is positive-stable. Forecasts indicate a possible increase of China's GDP in 2018 by 6.5%. At the same time, there are negative expectations in connection with the Sino-U.S. and potentially Sino-European "trade war". In its foreign policy, as a response to Western pressure, China progressively uses the Russian direction of its diplomacy in the expanded version of "Russia + SCO". The nuance here is seen in China's adjusted approach to the SCO: first of all, not as a mechanism for cooperation with Russia, but as an organization that allows using Russia's potential for pressure on the U.S. in the Sino-U.S. strategic rivalry. In the second half of 2018, the Chinese economy will continue to develop steadily, albeit with unresolved traditional problems (debts of provinces and state enterprises, ineffective state sector, risks on the financial and real estate markets). In politics, discontent with the cult of Xi will accumulate, but without real threats to his power. Weakening in economic opposition between China and the United States is possible due to Beijing's search for compromises on tariffs, intellectual property, trade deficit. To find such trade-offs, Xi Jinping will use a so-called "personal diplomacy" of direct contacts with Donald Trump.

AB The article discusses the activities of members of the Siberian commercial elite and public figures, known collectively as the "Zealots of the North," aimed at formulating and promoting the economic interests of their region in the 1860s. People such as the gold mine owners V. N. Latkin and M. K. Sidorov strove to draw the attention of the government, business circles, and the educated public to the problems of the Russian Empire's "northern borderlands." They were doing this by politicizing economic concerns and concealing their own business interests by using the rhetoric of patriotism and national security. By denouncing their foreign competitors as agents of anti-Russian foreign policies in Britain and other countries and criticizing the government for a lack of protectionist measures, the Zealots of the North found themselves in the camp of conservative and nationalist critics of the Great Reforms. The hopes of Latkin and Sidorov to convert their propaganda efforts into commercial profit turned out to be futile. However, the discourse of economic protectionism and antiforeign suspicions that they had fostered would become popular with supporters of various scenarios of Russia's economic and political isolationism.

AB There has been a call for a "second wave" of scholarship on policy advice to expand our understanding of the relational dynamics within a policy advisory system (PAS). In this article, we use a case from Brazil to address two key gaps in the PAS literature - the lack of attention to systems of network governance and the current predominance of "Westminster" empirical cases. To better understand the impact of policy advice within a system of networked governance, we apply the frame of "metagovernance" - the steering of governance networks. We then introduce and employ the concepts of funnelling, political brokering and gate-keeping to better understand how policy advice is shaped, modified and then either rejected or accepted. The contribution of the article is that, while much of the existing PAS literature describes the contours and key actors within an advisory system, we develop new conceptual scaffolding to better understand the trajectories and impact of policy advice, and the interplay between actors and agents, within a broader system of metagovernance.

ID POWER
AB This article examines the ability of the two leading theoretical perspectives in international relations (IR) - realism and liberalism - to explain various aspects of sanctions implemented against Russia after 2014, as well as Russia's countermeasures. Following arguments developed by Robert K. Merton, the author underlines the importance of middle-range theories in studying phenomena that lie at the confluence of economics, legal studies and political science, e.g. international sanctions. Moreover, the author points out the evident and pressing need to integrate sanctions within a broader theoretical context which would contribute to rethinking the nature of contemporary political interactions.
   The author consequently tests liberal and realist paradigms and concludes that sanctions fall into the grey zone of their explanatory capabilities. Finally, the author concludes that scholars should either abandon the idea of studying sanctions in terms of big theories and return to an instrumental understanding or they should reconfigure international realist and liberal explanatory principles - which would probably change the paradigms significantly. A third option is to develop a new ontology of international relations.

DT Article
DE situation analysis; world order; international studies; methodology;
   analytics; sanctions; decision-making
AB The article discusses the method of situation analysis of international relations, developed in the 1960s in the Primakov National Research Institute of World Economy and International Relations by Academician Evgeniy Primakov. It has incorporated many elements of existing problem-solving methods such as "brain storm", "Delphi", and others. Its key innovation is understanding the international political situations under analysis as integral dynamic subsystems of international system. It proceeds in three stages: first, building a scenario of a situation development; second, getting a large number of expert assessments representing various fields of social sciences; third, producing a final document with critical summary of the assessments. Primakov encouraged organizers of situation analysis to have experts focused on the issues of practical importance, and then prepare the results of the situation analysis in a concise, understandable form to make them useful in the decision-making process. He viewed the method as an effective means of communicating expert knowledge to decision makers. The article reviews the method as it has been practiced in the Primakov National Research Institute of World Economy and International Relations. It gives the intellectual roots of its development, which include "grounded theory" by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss; systems theory by Talcott Parsons and a variant of its application to international relations by Thierry de Montbrial. The more direct roots of the method are various problem-solving techniques practiced in world's leading international relations think-tanks such as RAND Corporation. The article also overviews the major principles of situation analysis: 1) participants must have high level of expertise; 2) situational analysis is multidisciplinary; 3) situational analysis allows focusing on key aspects of a problem when there is no clear, unambiguous understanding of it and when the views of experts vary widely; 4) to obtain significant analytical results, it is necessary to move above the situation under analysis in search of wider generalizations; 5) situational analysis is opposite to propaganda, it must be averted to conformism and partisanship; 6) situation analysis should be aimed at realizing national interests; 7) situation analysis is directed towards future. In addition to the general principles of situation analysis, the article gives two specific examples of its application. The first example is the phenomenon of the extreme-right political movements in the European Union. In this case the situation analysis gives a balanced assessment of what is happening in Russia's neighbourhood. The second is Russia's adoption of trade restrictive measures in response to the "sanctions" from Western countries because of the Ukrainian crisis. The situation analysis shows contradictory effects of the sanctions for the Russian economic development. These cases are small but important illustrations of global changes in both the internal life of sovereign states and the relations between them. The post-bipolar world obviously goes through a transformation, which many assess in terms of a multipolar or polycentric world order. The configuration of future polycentricity is not defined in advance and will depend on decisions of leading global players. Situation analysis can contribute to understanding and forecasting them.

DT Article
DE la famille; le menage; the family; the household; la republique; Bodin
AB The article examines the tradition of formation of the concepts "family" (famille) and "household" (menage) in the political theory of the French lawyer, Jean Bodin. The article looks into different editions of Six Books of the Commonwealth to explore the connotations of the key concepts and the meaning that Bodin ascribed to them. As secondary sources, Bodin uses the works by Xenophon, Aristotle, Apuleus, and Marcus Junianus Justin, as well as the Corpus Juris Civilis. Bodin examines three different traditions, those of Ancient Greece, Ancient Hebrew, and Ancient Rome. Each of these traditions has its own history of the concepts of the "family" and of the "household". Bodin refers to ancient traditions for polemics, but eventually offers his own understanding, not only of the concepts of "famille" and "menage", but also of the term "Republique", defined as the Republic, a term that (with some reservations) refers to the modern notion of state. The very fact that these concepts are being used signifies the division of the political space into the spheres of the private and the public. Furthermore, the concepts of the "family" and of the "household" are key to understand the essence of sovereignty as the supreme authority in the Republic. The author concludes that the difference between Bodin's concepts of the "family" and the "household" lies not only in the possession of property and its legal manifestation, but also in the fact that the "household" is seen by Bodin as the basis of the Republic, the first step in the system of subordination to the authority.

DE Switzerland; intemational cooperation; subnational regions; cantons;

AB The author examines the Swiss model of the division of powers between the federal center and the regions in the sphere of international relations. The delimitation of responsibilities leads to the optimization of the political process, to the development of an efficient foreign policy. This problem is highly relevant and requires political research. Based on the relevance, the main goal of this work is to analyze the delimitation of powers in the international sphere between the Confederation and the cantons of Switzerland. The objective of this study is to show how regions of states can participate in international cooperation and influence foreign policy. In the course of study, the author used the system methodology, in which the object of study appears as an integral, complexly organized system of international relations; methods of induction and deduction and comparative analysis were used. The following results were reached: the powers of domestic bodies of external relations of Switzerland and its regions in the field of international relations were analyzed, and it was shown that foreign policy in the Confederation and cantons is constructed from the bottom up, based on the civil society, that fundamental issues in international life are resolved by referendums, this takes into account the opinion of not only the people, but also the regions. The work shows how regions of states can participate in international cooperation and influence foreign policy. The study of the case of Switzerland allowed to summarize its experience, which may be useful to other states. The author shows that the regions are expanding the political and spatial influence of states, increasing their openness. In the course of the study, the author came to the following conclusion: the powers of the Confederation and cantons in the sphere of international relations are determined by the constitutions of Switzerland and the cantons, the laws of the Confederation and its regions. A major role in resolving important issues arising in the country, including in the field of international relations, is played by referendums held regularly in Switzerland, the constant policy of neutrality, as well as constant monitoring of the efficiency of government measures in the field of international cooperation.

   between South Korea and Japan
SO JAPANESE STUDIES IN RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE collective memory; comfort women; Japan; relations between Japan and
   South Korea; Republic of Korea; wianbu
AB The article analyzes how the "comfort women" issue influences current relations between the Republic of Korea and Japan. In the early twentieth century Japan annexed Korea, and the memories of colonial-era humiliation are vivid in Korean collective consciousness. As a result, issues of the past often sour bilateral relations even today. Recently, Seoul has been actively pressing the issue of sexual slavery in Japanese military brothels, and differences over this seemingly irrelevant issue have impeded political and military cooperation.
   Articles on former sexual slaves (also called wianbu in Korean) have resurfaced time and again in Korean press throughout the 1940-80s, but the problem internationalized only in the 1990s, when broad public discussion started. Although Japan maintains that the 1965 bilateral normalization resolved all issues of the past, Tokyo has several times offered official condolences and compensations to the victims, however Seoul found these steps or the tone unsatisfactory. Most recently, in 2015, Abe Shinzo and Park Geunhye signed an agreement to close the wianbu issue, but the document irritated South Korean public and opposition, so Seoul abandoned it. President Moon Jaein, who came to power in 2017, continued this course and added pressure on related historical problems, such as Korean forced laborers in imperial Japan. As the crisis deepened, Tokyo introduced economic sanctions against South Korea (technically on unrelated grounds).
   Conflicts stemming from collective memory are a characteristic feature of North East Asian political culture. They are a popular tool in foreign and domestic policy of many countries. This, coupled with irrational nature of nationalism and imperfection of regional security, makes issues of the past a very real threat to the present.

TI Russia's Foreign Policy Evolution in the New Balkan Landscape
SO POLITICKA MISAO-CROATIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Balkans; Croatia; EU; NATO; Russia; Serbia
AB The article reflects on the issue of the foreign policy strategy of modern Russia in the Balkans region. One of the most significant aspects of this problem is the difference in views between Russia and the West. Authors show how different interpretations of the events in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s predetermined the sense of mutual suspicion and mistrust which spread to other regions such as the post-Soviet space. Exploring differences between the Russian and the Western (Euro-Atlantic) views on the current matters, authors draw attention to fundamental differences in terminology: while the Western narrative promotes more narrow geographical and political definitions (such as the Western Balkan Six), traditional Russian experts are more inclined to wider or integral definitions such as "the Balkans" and "Central and Southeast Europe". Meanwhile none of these terms are applicable for analysis of the current trends such as the growing transit role of the Balkans region and its embedding in the European regional security architecture. Therefore, a new definition is needed to overcome the differences in vision and better understand significant recent developments in the region. Conceptualizing major foreign policy events in Central and Southeast Europe during the last three decades (the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s), authors demonstrate the significance of differences in tools and methods between the Soviet Union and the modern Russia. Permanent need for adaptation to changing political and security context led to inconsistence in Russian Balkan policy in the 1990s. Nevertheless, Russia was able to preserve an integral vision of the region and even to elaborate new transregional constructive projects, which in right political circumstances may promote stability and become beneficial for both Russia and the Euro-Atlantic community.

AB The article is devoted to the problem of political authority that is viewed as a fact of a social reality. The author regards authority as a sociopolitical institution rooted in the biological nature of a human being and evolving throughout the history. The article suggests a framework for a holistic theory of political authority and highlights four stages of its development. The first stage is (political) authority in its pre-human version. These are the forms of leadership generated by the need to solve the functional problem of cooperation among social animals and imply a mobile structure that is based on trust in the leader and is responsive to changes, rather than a rigid hierarchy. The second stage is the emergence of a functional replication of the "animal authority" within the first human communities, formation of the institution of authority and its mergence with religious ideas, the emergence of faith in supernatural agents and supernatural punishment. The third stage is the development of political authority as a religious authority, which led to the establishment of the institution of delegating power from someone who lacks physical properties - God, Gods or state as a "mortal God". The fourth stage is the demystified political authority, which is established in a secular modern society, but retains some elements of its predecessors. According to the author, such an empirical approach to understanding political authority opens up a possibility, among other things, to solve some problems of normative theories, allowing a clearer understanding of the role of authority in the political life of a society.

DT Article
DE Jews; Jewish identity; Siberian Jews; Jewish Diaspora; Jewish
   religiosity
AB The state of Jewish communities in Western Siberia in the historical perspective is analyzed. On the basis of a wide range of archival sources the author analyzes the specifics of the life of such communities during four historical periods: pre-revolutionary, change of political regimes (1917-1919), Soviet and post-Soviet. A special place in the article is given to the phenomenon of regional (Siberian) variant of Jewish identity. The purpose of the article is to analyze the transformations in the understanding and realization of the idea of community life of Jews living in Western Siberia for two centuries of the Jewish Diaspora in the region. The results of a quantitative survey conducted by the author in autumn 2018 are presented. On the basis of comparative analysis of the data, the author comes to a conclusion that the socio-cultural image of the West Siberian communities retains typical characteristics of the Jewish regional (Siberian) identity. At the same time, the main indicators of the level of religiosity, national and cultural identification, age and educational characteristics correspond to the general picture of Russian Jewry, which indicates a close connection between the provincial Jewry of different regions of Russia and Russian Jewry in general. The analysis of the dynamics of Jewish national and cultural life in Western Siberia gives grounds to consider the thesis of the observed crisis of the Jewish Diaspora in the Russian province premature.

The intensification of economic and cultural relations between the USSR and Italy at the turn of the 1950s - 1960s. contributed to the establishment of political interaction, although it was also due to purely political reasons related to early detente in relations between the USSR and Western countries.

AB The Aldan-Maadyr National Museum has more than 1,000 coins and banknotes issued by various states and governments of the early 20th century. This article describes the museum's holding of monetary units issued by the People's Republic of Tuva. As shown in the museum accessory books, banknotes/coins and securities came mostly as donations by local residents.
   Our study of several such collections preserved at the museum allowed us to trace the history of monetary reforms in the PRT. For instance, the 1954 collection sheds light on the history of Tuva's currency, the aksha, issued in 1935 and 1940 and the features of both respective issues. In 1955, the museum exhibited the 3, 5, 10 and 15-kopeck PRT coins minted in 1934 and remaining in circulation prior to the accession of the PRT into the USSR. In 1956, the museum acquired Salchak Toka's personal collection. Its owner was the leader of the republic's Communist party from 1932 to 1973. His collection included not only the Tuvan aksha, but also the bonds - banknotes issued in 1925, 1926, and 1928 bearing the PRT stamp. The latter are an evidence of the transition phase in Tuva's monetary reform. In 1959, the museum was presented with a collection of Czarist Russia bankbills of 1898 (1 ruble), 1905 (3 rubles), and 1909 (5 and 10 rubles). They were used at one of the first stages of monetary reform implemented by Ministry of Finance of the PRT in 1923.
   The collection of monetary units of National Museum of Tuva is a highly valuable source for studying the republic's economic development. The surviving samples of monetary units issued in 1935 and 1940, as well as the stamped bills which had been in circulation in earlier periods, allow us to obtain reliable details that may provide insight into characteristic aspects of the rise of the financial system of PRT, political leaders who implemented economic reforms, and the involvement of the USSR in social and economic development of Tuva in the early twentieth century.

AB In this article, we consider the development of international relations in the Baltic region in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. This study aims to analyse the security prospects of the Baltic region in view of the changes in the overall geopolitical situation in Europe and in the relations between Russia and its closest neighbours and the leading NATO countries.
   We examine the ideas and forecasts of international and Russian experts relating to the state and dynamics of military security in the region at the first stage of the Baltics' membership in NATO. Another focus is on changes in the strategy of the NATO leadership for the Baltic region as a priority zone of potential warfare and, thus, for the presence of the alliance in the area. We stress that the steps taken by the NATO leadership prompted the Russian side to assign a special role in the country's foreign policy to the Kaliningrad region and to take practical steps to ensure peace and security in the region.

ID GEOPOLITICS; STATE
AB The progress and sustainability of international cross-border region formation is a major concern for Russia, a country bordering sixteen states. In the early 2000s, the development of regions with Russian participation was at its height in northwestern Europe. Cross-border regions arise both naturally, stemming from various functional relations, and as a result of political decisions. In the latter case, political discourse is an important factor in successful region-building. The Northern Dimension (ND) programme, which was launched in 1997, embodied the principle of depoliticised cooperation - Europe's 'new regionalism'. This article aims to evaluate the role of the ND in the federal and regional political discourse of 1997-2016, to determine its place among other cross-border cooperation projects, and to follow changes in the understanding of its goals. The study relies on data from the Integrum agency, which has built up the most comprehensive digital archive of federal and regional printed and online media. The federal discourse on the ND reflected the whole set of relations between Russia and the EU. The idea about the crisis of the programme came from the discrepancy between the expectations aroused by political discourse and the actual results of cooperation. The study shows the ND-related discourse changed over the study period and stresses profound differences between federal and regional discourses.

TI THE PHENOMENON OF "FOREIGNERS", YASAK AND GIFT EXCHANGE: PEOPLES OF THE

AB Objective: To discuss debated issues relating to the special characteristics of patriality of non-Russian peoples who had been in the sphere of influence of the former Kazan and Siberian Khanates and were included into the system of the Tsardom of Moscovy in the sixteenth century; the classification of this population and the terminology used for its description; the special features of the status of the indigenous peoples classified as "yasak people"; and the role of gift exchange in the process of their integration into the Russian state structure.
   Research materials: The article is based on the analysis of previous works on the topic under consideration and on the analysis of published historical sources or sources found in the collections of Russian archives.
   Results and novelty of the research: The foreign status of the people and comunities treated as the others within the Russian political space, and their transitional status on the way towards their full allegiance, were described with different socionyms and politonyms in the period under consideration. "Foreigners" was employed as the main term. It is considered as an indicator of changes in the status of various groups of the non-Russian population. The use of words such as "foreigner", etc. faded away in the official paper work regarding the Volga region and Cis-Urals autochthonous population during the seventeenth century, even while it became widely used if talking about those peoples who settled in the territories from the Urals to the Pacific Ocean. This can be explained by the following factors: the pace and degree of integration of new lands into the Russian state system; the remote character of the new lands; the continuing resistance of Kuchum's descendants who drew former Turk and Ugric subjects of the Siberian Khan into their orbit; the periodic "shakiness and betrayals" on the part of Siberian yasak payers; their commitment to pagan cults and Islam and the extremely small number of newly baptized people. Reciprocal interactions played a significant part in the process of subjection of the indigenous peoples of the Urals and Siberia. The regional version of the governance model in the form of mutual exchange between the authorities and the subjects was reflected in the formula used in the "word of grand" (zhalovannoe slovo) included in the instructions to the Siberian voivodes of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Gifts and rewards to the indigenous population in response to the proffering of gift-furs (pominochnaya ruhlyad') were an effective means of providing the collection of yasak. In contrast to the Volga region, the yasak in the territories under consideration did not convert into a land tax and retained features of a tribute for the right to reside on the land until the beginning of the eighteenth century.
   Thus, special features of the position of different groups who paid yasak were kept. The conditions for establishing a legal connection with the state on the basis of belonging to a certain social stratum were still being formed. As such, this situation does not permit us to consider a heterogeneous mass of "yasak people" in Russia in the seventeenth century as a social estate.

DT Article
DE corruption; destabilization; coup d'etat; coup attempt; GDP growth;
   growth sustainability; rational values; survival values; values of
   self-expression; per capita GDP; traditional values
AB The frequency of coups and coup attempts is shown to be approximately equally related both to the level of corruption and to the level of per capita GDP; with regard to attempts to overthrow the central government, the influence of the GDP per capita level is slightly stronger, whereas with regard to the overthrow of all authorities in aggregate, both central and local, the degree of corruption has a greater impact. At the same time, both indicators are in close connection, but the rate of GDP growth does not have a stable correlation with corruption and is weakly correlated-with the frequency of attempts to violently overthrow the state authorities. The detected relationships are connected in a complex way with the human values. In the group of developed countries with a level of corruption less than 40 points, we find a significant positive correlation between non-corruptness and values of self-expression. In other countries, values do not influence the level of corruption, but they affect the rate of economic growth and the frequency of attempts to overthrow the government. The study suggests that, with equal levels of corruption in low and middle income countries, the rejection of traditionalism produces a positive impact on political stability and rapid economic growth, whereas a premature transition to values of self-expression may produce a negative impact on economic growth. On the other hand, for a country to exceed the GDP per capita level of about 20-25 thousand dollars a year is problematic if its development is not accompanied by the reduction of corruption below the level of 40-50 points. There is reason to believe that modern Russia (with a per capita GDP of about 25 thousand dollars per year and a level of corruption of more than 70 points) can he just in this situation.

AB The article is devoted to two anniversaries of St. Petersburg University - the 295th anniversary of the foundation (the decree of Emperor Peter the Great) and the 200th anniversary of the official renewal (the decree of Emperor Alexander I). The article focuses on the controversial path that a university corporation had taken from an "academic" university of the 18th century to the mass university of the early twentieth century. The article shows the unity of the tradition of university education in St. Petersburg, reconstructs the logic of transformations of university education institutions in the capital of the Russian Empire in the 18th - early 19th centuries. The inextricable link between the corporate history of the metropolitan university and the history of the development of the "university ideal" and "university model" in modern Europe is demonstrated. The work traces the main milestones of the institutional history of St. Petersburg University in the context of the socio-political history of Russia, changes in the nature of the state and public order with regard to university education. The paper discusses the main regulations governing the organization of the university (in particular, the Regulations on the Establishment of the Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1724, Regulations and States of the Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1747, University Charters of 1804, 1835, 1863, 1884, and etc.). Particular attention is paid to the concept of "university autonomy", its role in the life of the university. The role of the St. Petersburg (Petrograd) University in the social and political life of Russia before the revolution is considered.

TI SELF-ORGANISING SYSTEMS IN THE CONTEXT OF ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT
SO OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE academic migration; self-organising systems; intercultural communicative
   tolerance
AB Introduction. In the era of globalisation, which affects all spheres of modern social life (political, financial, scientific, technical, religious, cultural), the processes of internationalisation and academic migration in higher education have significantly intensified. The rapidly growing mobility in higher education, when students study outside their country of residence, is accompanied by certain problems, which include students' adaptation to the conditions of unfamiliar urban environment. The introduction of new methodological tools for teaching humanitarian disciplines in universities can contribute to the elimination of barriers and successful transition of students to another, different from their customary, socio-cultural environment.
   The aim of the research was to present the results of experimental work aimed at the development of students' intercultural communicative tolerance within the foreign language learning, and to reveal the role of self-organising systems in the university international academic environment.
   Methodology and research methods. The study is based on the theory of self-organising systems. In the process of designing and application of the authors' technology aimed at developing students' intercultural communicative tolerance, experimental methods and the method of comparative analysis were used.
   Results and scientific novelty. It has been shown that academic migration is a self-organising system characterised by socio-cultural instability. The factors of human transition from one urboecological niche to another, which often disturbs the balance of social systems, have been described. Lacking knowledge about such processes in the theory and practice of pedagogy within higher education has been stated. Insufficient level of intercultural communicative tolerance of Russian (132 people) and foreign (40 people) students, who studied at the Ural Federal University (Ekaterinburg, Russia) in 2015, has proved the necessity of its systematic focused formation. The technology for the development of this type of tolerance within the framework of the 'Foreign Language' discipline has been proposed. The approbation of the technology has demonstrated its effectiveness. The students have not only acquired the necessary competencies, but also learned to adapt to the new academic environment, as well as had the opportunity to directly participate in the creation of their own academic programs.
   Practical significance. The research confirms the productivity of mutual adaptation of students to an unfamiliar socio-cultural academic environment. The author's technology of intercultural communicative tolerance development can be used to optimise the pedagogical conditions of maintaining the processes of internationalisation and academic mobility within universities.

AB The article focuses on the specifics in the functioning of external and internal trading zones of scientific communities. Internal trading zones involve interactions between scientists belonging to different scientific subcultures. External trading zones aim at introducing the science and technology results into industry and social practice, as well as at recruiting new members into scientific communities. The specificity of internal and external trading zones in science can be revealed through their comparison with internal and external trading zones of other communities, for example, religious or political. As a result of such comparative analysis, the study has indicated that internal trading zones imply a mutual agreement between their participants, while trading zones of other communities proceed from the fact that such agreement is already given. External zones of science exchange, recruiting new members into scientific communities and spreading their results outside the scientific community, do not seek to turn all people into scientists but rather provide an opportunity to form a critical position to the existing knowledge and values. External areas of exchange in other communities basically aim to recruit new members. They seek to transform all people into members of their communities, sharing common values that can be criticized only to a very small extent.

TI Deja vu: Medieval Motifs in Modern Arab Political Life
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Arab world; fityan; militias; sultan; caliph; armies; medievalism;
   civilizationalism
AB The article analyzes specific elements of the Arab societies' political life which distinguish it from political relations in the Western nation-states. Admitting the existence of a large number of such kind of elements, the authors focus only on three of them which are related to the sources of power and its distribution. Emphasizing that these elements are deeply rooted into the Arab-Muslim political tradition, so that they have tended to be present throughout the whole Islamic period of the region, the authors find out that each of them has its own medieval countertype. Thus, the article addresses the dichotomy of the supreme power of caliphs and sultans, formed in the IX - XI centuries and manifested today both in Jihadist organizations (i.e. ISIS, Al-Qaeda) and in the political strategies of moderate Islamist movements, such as Tunisian party Al-Nahda. The second example is the urban militias, which are correlated with the medieval phenomenon of "young hero" or "chivalry" communities - fityan. The fityan communities have seven specific traits, which not only are characteristic of the militias, but also demonstrate fundamental difference between the militias and urban criminal groups. Major attention is paid to Libyan militias, which are studied on the materials of field research conducted by one of the authors. Finally, the third element discussed is the particular role of the army and other security forces in the Arab political systems.
   The authors provide three possible interpretations of all the revealed coincidences. According to the first one, they are presented as aberrations of the researcher's scientific consciousness, which make them look for historical equivalents to contemporary issues. Second interpretation belongs to the tradition of "the new medievalism". According to it, the described phenomenon is in fact the revival of some medieval practices, caused by the end of the Modernity era. The last interpretation views the analyzed elements as distinctive civilization traits of the Arab world.

DE Russian Federation; scientific and technological development strategy;
   Toynbee; Challenges and Responses; historical experience; 18th century;
   import of institutions; import of technologies
AB The Strategy of the Scientific and Technological Development of the Russian Federation considers the tasks facing the state in the term of challenge and answers. The topic of challenges and answers that Russia has encountered is not new and is not something specific for the 21st century. In previous articles, the challenges that Russia faced in the 17-18th centuries were analyzed.
   The article shows that the development of Russia in the first half of the 19th century was impacted by challenges posed by the powers of Europe. At the beginning of the century, the main was the revolutionary French challenge of both military and ideological character. In the military sphere, the answer to it was given by mastering the French tactics of the columns. However, political reforms were blocked by the traditionalist reaction.
   Also, in the first half of the 19th century, the challenges of the previous period persisted. One of these was the cultural challenge of France; this challenge sounded with renewed vigor after Russian officers saw Paris in 1814. The nobility wished to live in Russia like in Paris. This caused a new consumer boom. The duties of serfs were increased two to three times to pay for competition in luxury. Excessive duties brought the peasants to starvation; cholera joined the famine; an increase in mortality caused demographic stagnation. Ultimately, the challenge took a more dangerous form of food insecurity.
   Another challenge emerging as early as the 18th century was a challenge from the "regular states" of Central Europe, Prussia and Austria. The construction of a regular state meant the creation of a bureaucratic absolute monarchy regulating the life of society. This was the goal of Nicholas I. However, although the emperor had achieved considerable success, he did not feel strong enough to eliminate serfdom.

TI POPULISM AND ELITISM IN CONTEMPORARY RUSSIA
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russia; populism; elitism; democracy; authoritarianism
ID ALEXEI NAVALNY; NATIONALISM
AB In light of the recent political tendencies in multiple regions across the globe, including Europe and Northern America, populism has become one of the most prominent subjects of research among political scientists. However, in Russia populism studies still remain unsystematic, and many scholars tend to define populism as "rhetoric", while paying little attention to its role in the political process. By contrast, we argue that one should combine an ideational approach with an approach considering populism as a strategy of political mobilization in order to grasp the populist phenomenon in the Russian context. By focusing on the main political actors in today's Russia, who are often described as populists, we seek to clarify the relationship between two forms of modern demagoguery, i.e. populism, based on the flattering of "the people", and elitism which disdains "the people" in one or another way. Thus, we demonstrate that the major problem in Russia is elitism, not populism. On the other hand, we argue that populism is not an essentially negative phenomenon and can have positive impacts on the political process both in liberal democracies and non-democracies. Instead of regarding populism as a dangerous threat to democracy, it is more fruitful to consider it as a "simplified" vision of democracy. As such, populism, both in its social and national forms, can contribute to spread basic democratic principles among the population under authoritarian and post-authoritarian conditions, when political pluralism is significantly restrained, ideological attitudes are poorly differentiated, and civil society is weak.

DT Article
DE Science; profession; vocation; Max Weber; social epistemology;
   cultural-historical epistemology
AB In a report read for the student elite a hundred years ago, Max Weber stated: the motivation based on vocation leaves the activities of a scientist, and socialized motives of professional work remain - domestic, career, political-ideological. Today, this Weberian statement can be simply projected onto modern science, which to a large extent has already turned into a pragmatically oriented socio-economic institution. Meanwhile, the consequences of pushing out a vocational element that fills scientist's aspiration to learn reality with an existential meaning turn into serious problems for scientific activity, including at the level of cognitive practices. And the question is, what should be the vector of conceptual understanding of this problem, allowing at least to clarify the prospects of science. In the article, the author substantiates the thesis that, for all the importance of the socio-institutional dimensions of scientific activity, the sociological consideration of science can only fix the existing state of affairs. Out of sight is just what was originally the basis of the existential motivation of scientists - the aspiration to discover the true knowledge of reality. This scientifically-oriented intention of general significance has been tinted in different ways in different cultural and historical contexts, but its essence has always been preserved by European culture. Today it needs a new cultural and historical understanding, able to balance the social and pragmatic orientation of modern science.

DT Article
DE epoch of turbulence; global crises; revolutionary waves; intrasocietal
   order; international order; international law; responsibility of elites
AB The article is devoted to conceptualization of the phenomenon described by the term "epoch of turbulence". The epoch of turbulence is defined as a historical period when social and international conflicts become more frequent and aggravated, exacerbated by the increased violence, which is reflected in the social sentiments full of confusion and anxiety, intensity of insurrections, revolutions, and wars that affect the strongest states and violate significantly their internal social order, as well as the order of international relations. Epochs of turbulence occur at both regional and global levels. Due to the European nations' global expansion that started in the 16th century, epochs of turbulence in Europe are especially important, and by the 20th century they have become increasingly global. Six major epochs of turbulence can be identified: 1) 1517-1648 (Reformation and religious wars); 2) 1789-1815 (Great French Revolution, the subsequent revolutionary and Napoleonic wars), 3) 1848-1871 ("Spring of Nations", the Crimean War, the Bismarck Wars, the Paris Commune); 4) 1914-1919 (World War I, the Russian Revolution and the polemogenic revolutionary waves); 5) 1939-1953 (World War II, Communist Revolutions and Korean War); 6) 2003 - present (the current epoch of turbulence). The notion of the epoch of turbulence is included in the conceptual model of the coevolution of social, mental and functional orders. It is shown that each of the epochs of turbulence was overcome through the adoption of a new international order, new principles of the internal political structure of the states, the spread of novel religious, social, and moral values. On the basis of the factors that made it possible to overcome the epochs of turbulence in the past and documenting the basic causes of the current epoch of turbulence, the author delineates the contours of the international order that is capable of providing a solution to the situation of chaos and uncertainty.

AB Introduction. The paper conducts the analysis of the attempt of the Cossack revival in Russia in different historical periods of the 20th and early 21st centuries. The attempt of revival is treated as a series of social experiments that involved the government and the Cossacks as a social group. The relevance of the issue is due to the need for complex studying the relations between the government and the Cossacks in the conditions of transformation and systemic modernization in different periods. The revival experiments of different periods had both specific and common characteristics as to their tasks and forms. It is important to study the tasks, participants, forms and methods of the revival experiments in different periods. Methods and materials. The author uses the historical method, the conception of systemic modernization and transformation, and the conception of social and cultural construction. Analysis. The paper determines two main periods in the history of the relations between the government and the Cossacks in the 20th - early 21st centuries that can be characterized as "the Cossack revival". The author establishes the reasons of those social experiments as well as the roles of participants, and the forms and ways of Cossacks' integration into the new social and political relations. Results. The article determines that all the attempts of the Cossack revival were undertaken during the systemic modernization. The author determines the main difference between the periods. In the 1920s - 1930s there were transformation of the Cossacks and their adaptation to the new conditions. The late 1980s - early 1990s can be characterized as the period of social and cultural formation of the Cossacks as a social group. Within each period revival development stages that display peculiar features of those experiments can be determined. The mid 1920s was the period of involving Cossacks in the Soviet construction processes. Some Cossack cultural elements were restored and the authorities sought to establish a dialogue with the Cossacks. In the mid 1930s the government actions were rather ostentatious. In both periods the initiator of the processes was the government. In the late 1980s - early 1990s, the initiators of the revival process were Cossacks themselves while the authorities played an important role as a supporter of the revival movement. Within this period the early 2000s can be marked out when the process of the Cossack revival shifted from cultural development to the Cossacks' public service.

TI POLITICAL THEORY AND CONCEPT OF THE POLITICAL
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE political theory; the political; political concepts; political event;
   human
AB The concept of the political is a central and yet one of the most controversial categories in the political thought. Despite the long history of reflection about the concept of the political, today there is still a lack of consensus not only about the substantive content of this notion, but also about its very right to exist. The purpose of this article is to clarify the epistemological opportunities of political theory in relation to the concept of the political.
   If political theory is part of positive political science and is an autonomous form of knowledge, independent from philosophy, it must also include a special way of thinking about the political. The article gives a brief description of the subject field of political theory, describes the specificity of its view on social and political phenomena, and justifies the statement that the political manifests itself in the form of an event.
   By virtue of the immanent bias of political thought, it is impossible to know about a political event beyond its borders. Thus, according to the author, political theory should focus on pre-political situations, in which political events can occur. To identify such situations, it is necessary to shift the focus from the "friend-enemy" formula to the "human-non-human" dichotomy. A political event happens when the fundamental norms of humanity are problematized at the collective level and a space opens up where people involved in the event are forced to take one or the other side. The boundary between human and non-human in a political event is erased, which determines the existential nature of the confrontation between friends and enemies.

TI POLITICAL LOGIC OF "MULTITUDO" IN THE WORKS OF HOBBES AND SPINOZA
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE multitude; people; political philosophy; theory of affects; Hobbes;
   Spinoza
AB The article explores the concept of multitude developed in the writings of T.Hobbes and B. Spinoza - two most profound political philosophers of the 17th century. The authors attempt to conceptualize the multitude by interpreting it as a special part of political reality, the very mode of existence of which turns out to be a problem for political thinkers, rather than by applying the logic of developing a political subject. According to their conclusion, the study of multitude should proceed from ontology to ideology, rather than in the opposite direction. This is the only way to build a common perspective that reflects the real tension between the systems of Hobbes and Spinoza.
   The first part of the article discusses the views of Hobbes and Spinoza on the essence of multitude. The English philosopher views multitude as a chaotic matter, the movement of which needs to be regulated by concluding a social contract and establishing sovereign power. Spinoza, on the one hand, builds upon Hobbes, but on the other hand, opposes him. The authors see the sources of discrepancies between the two approaches to multitude in the difference in ontologies related, in particular, to the concepts of motion, matter and body.
   The second part of the article is devoted to studying the relationship between the multitude and the state. The Hobbesian construction of sovereignty is interpreted as a means designed to solve the problem of the multitude by giving it a monolithic form of the people. In Spinoza's ontology, the regulation of matter from the outside is impossible. In order to explain the dynamics of the multitude, he draws upon the concept of power and the theory of affects and formulates the idea of the dual - simultaneously destructive and creative nature of the multitude.
   Based on their analysis, the authors conclude that in contrast to modern theorists, Hobbes and Spinoza do not view the multitude as an empirical subject. Rather, they view the multitude as the primary logic of the existence of the many, which must be understood and ultimately overcome (from the Hobbesian point of view) or mastered by politicians in order to maintain the correct composition of institutions (from the point of view of Spinoza).

AB The article proposes looking at the problem of state border security through the eyes of Russian border-town residents. Based on field research, the article examines what residents perceive to be threats and how they understand protections against those threats. The conceptual framework of the analysis is securitization theory, proposed in the late 1990s by members of the Copenhagen school of international studies and critically reconsidered in the last two decades. The article aims to identify the similarities and differences between everyday understandings of security in different border zones of Russia and between residents' perception of their rotes in maintaining security. The study suggests possible explanations for the observed variability, proceeding from the specifics of local sociocultural, political, and spatial contexts. The comparative analysis involves the towns of Armiansk, Dzhankoi, Troitsk, and Zabaikal'sk, all of which are situated in immediate proximity to the state border. The selection of these four towns was determined by fundamentally different conditions at the corresponding parts of the Russian border: (a) the nonrecognized conflict border between Russia and Ukraine in Crimea; (b) the open border with Kazakhstan in Chelyabinsk Oblast; and (c) the state border with China in Zabaikal'skii Krai. The first section of the article analyzes residents' attitudes to the problem of open/closed borders in the context of security for local communities. The second section considers the factors influencing people's opinions, such as ethnic and cultural stereotypes, life context (urban area), and perceptions of the home state and of the neighboring country. The conclusion discusses discrepancies between state priorities and the interests of local residents caused by differing interpretations of security in the border zone.

ID REGIME RESPONSIVENESS
AB The article analyses why market reforms in the post-Soviet states led them to a state of prolonged stagnation, while the PRC was able to demonstrate significant progress in its socio-economic and technological development and became the second economic power of the world. The object of the research is the transformation of the political systems of the PRC and the post Soviet countries in the process of intersystem transition. The authors argue that the success of China was due not only to authoritarian modernization, which has repeatedly demonstrated its effectiveness in the process of transitioning from an agrarian society to an industrial one. The CCP's adherence to Chinese political tradition played a huge role, according to which the state, with its professional bureaucracy, remains the constant basis of social order despite any other changes. Dynasties and political elites replacing each other in power do not destroy the state, but improve it, turning it into an effective tool for the adaptation of society to new challenges. During reforms, China succeeded in keeping the balance between stability and development. The post-Soviet countries, with the exception of Russia, were in significantly different conditions: they did not have developed traditions of statehood so had to start building new ones; in some of them, in the 1990s, the predominant opinion was that in the process of transitioning to a market the role of the state should be mininfized, Post-Soviet elites were not interested in creating strong and stable institutions of state power. Their activity was subordinated to realizing groups' interests.

SO RUSSIAN LAW JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE theory of justice; Eurasian integration
ID PHILOSOPHY
AB This article examines Eurasian integration in the context of the ideas which accompany it and make possible the implementation of its practices, especially law-making and law-enforcement practices. The central theme of the article is the competition among values and social technologies claiming to play an integrating role. The starting point of this analysis is the theory of justice by John Rawls presented in the form of many interpretations thereof by legal theorists, as well as experts in the field of political and moral philosophy. It is examined based on assessments made from the standpoint of the politico-legal and socio-historical development of the West, as well as on attempts to look at this theoretical concept from a different cultural and civilizational point of view. Detailed consideration is given to the ideas and images of justice formed within the philosophical symbiosis of Confucianism and Legalism and providing a value-based legal identity of the Chinese civilization. The article shows that the ideas and values of the Rawlsian theory of justice are rooted in the political and legal history of European civilization and the dependence thereof on the philosophical and theoretical language of European enlighteners and even on the Indo-European national language family. As the main alternative to the neoliberal theory of justice, the article studies the philosophical and theoretical and politico-legal heritage of the Eurasianists. The theory of Eurasian law advanced by representatives of this movement is analyzed in depth. This type of legal relations, based on obligations, is considered as a special type of law capable of uniting heterogeneous entities without requiring their full unification or depriving them of their civilizational and value-based peculiarities. The authors analyze the real experience of economic and politico-legal integration, both within the framework of international organizations and at the level of inter-governmental [inter-country] cooperation. An assessment is made of the justifiability of the claims of Eurasianist philosophy regarding its ability to successfully provide integration processes in this part of the world.

DE symbols; values; conflicts; international relations; foreign policy
   behavior; status issues; ethno-confessional factor; traditionalism;
   identity
AB The article considers the impact of symbols and values on international relations in the Middle East. Symbolic politics has long been regarded as an integral part of domestic politics, but nowadays its translation into the foreign policy is attracting more and more attention. The behavior of the states in the international arena reflects the role played by values and symbols, by historical narrative and status issues. The symbolic content of the foreign policy agenda of the Middle East countries is most obvious. It can be linked to the incomplete processes of nation-building and to the remaining fragmentation of local societies, to traditionalism; to systemic conflicts with ethno-confessional dimension. Fear and deep-rooted distrust among the main regional players prevent an adequate assessment of the intentions and capabilities of an opponent, often causing an overreaction to the challenges. In terms of threat perception, an important role can be played by subjective factors closely associated with the tradition, which dictates a certain mode of behavior. A special role in the formation and conduct of foreign policy is played by "politically suitable past", when the glorification of ancestors is used to require from contemporaries the same dedication and willingness to sacrifice. One of the central political issues remains the question of its value content. Values are translated through symbols and rituals, which secure a symbolic contract between the government and society. More than often a political practice does not correspond to the declared values, especially in the foreign policy. The gap between the lofty goals declared by states and non-state actors and the methods of their implementation may be impressive. The struggle for justice can be easily combined with an extreme cruelty, and the promotion of democracy with a military invasion. The article marshals a number of examples illustrating the above assumptions.

AB The authors determine and verify the systems of indicators of public reflection regarding the issues of digitalization in Russia, construct and empirically describe their landscapes. The representatives of the Russian and Belarusian scientific expert communities and ordinary citizens of the Russian Federation were the main nominal groups of respondents in the study undertaken in 2019. The research is of an exploratory nature and serves as a tool for testing techniques for studying the problems posed in the article in the context of the technological "hype" of digitalization.
   The perception of a number of mass digitalization mythologemes by the experts are of particular interest. A list of mythologemes under estimation goes as follows: "enslaving humanity with artificial intelligence"; "saving humanity by means of artificial intelligence"; "total surveillance is the goal of modern data technology (DT)"; "DT is a way of enriching elites"; Industry 4.0 is just a form of global capitalism.; "DT creates nature and society of the "third-order"; "achieving technological singularity through digitalization"; "reaching the stage of the Posthuman"; "the imminent creation of human-machine symbiots, "cyborgs".
   As a result of studying the problem of social reflection of digital declarations which are politically imperative for the national economy and sociocultural life of Russia, we can argue that in reality they do not come to the forefront of partnership dialogue in the institutions of the society. Despite the relevance of consolidating social efforts to achieve a technological breakthrough and the marketability of the topic of digitalization, it is not provided with either the political request of elite groups or the research interest of social sciences or understanding of the essence of the issue by the main groups of the population.

SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Africa; USSR; Russian-African cooperation; Sochi Summit; non-resource
   export; investment; scientific diplomacy
AB This article critically reviews the previous and the still existing scholarship that promotes skeptical and arrogant approach to the debate on Russia's economic cooperation with Africa. It problematizes prevailing conceptualizations, addresses methodological difficulties of data analysis, scrutinizes theoretical references in past algumentations and political actions in this respect. As an alternative to negative approaches prevailing in the 1990s and early 2000s, the authors suggest to cease neglecting the window of opportunities opened by dynamic nature of the rapidly developing African economies. Time is ripe for launching and implementing a New Strategy of economic cooperation with Africa. The article provides an analysis of the accumulated experience of Soviet-African cooperation. It demonstrates the available possibilities of reaping benefit from its use for the purposes of strengthening Russia's economic and political positions on the African continent to achieve the announced goals of becoming one of the five largest economies in the world, ensuring high rates of economic growth, and creating in the basic sectors of the economy, particularly in manufacturing and agriculture, a highly productive export-oriented sector, based on modern technologies and fully provided with highly qualified personnel. The authors posit that in the existing conditions it is almost impossible to complete this ambitious task without interacting with African market. Russian industry undergoes a long awaited but still tentative revival. Emerging and developing countries, particularly burgeoning African economies, which offer an ever increasing demand, currently offer welcoming environment for testing the quality and competitiveness of Russian manufacturing goods. China selected this path in the 1990s, successfully taking over the share of the rapidly growing African consumer market vacated by Russia. However, it is not only and not so much an increase in mutual trade that Africa awaits from Russia, not even cooperation in mining, but investments in other strategic industries and sectors of the economy, such as energy generation, infrastructure construction, particularly transport related infrastructure projects like highways and road construction, railways, airports and maritime ports development, processing and manufacturing, sectors of advanced technological knowledge and skills application.

AB The paper is a preliminary publication of a large hoard of Bosporan staters found in Phanagoria's Eastern necropolis in 2011. It contains 3695 coins struck in the 3rd-4th centuries AD under Ininthimaios, Rhescuporis v, Pharsanzes, Sauromates IV, Teiranes and Thothorses, as well as barbarian imitations of latter staters. The Phanagorian hoard is evidence on the historical background of the epoch and sheds new light on the economy, currency and many technical aspects of the coin production in the Late Bosporos. The recent survey of coins from the hoard by X-ray spectroscopy and the neutron tomography first revealed staters of Sauromates IV, Teiranes and Thothorses with the silver content and surface-silvered coating. The treasure was deposited in AD 307/308, due to political instability in the region caused by the increased barbarian pressure on the borders of the Roman Empire and the ancient states in the Black Sea Region.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE bounded rationality; university management; uncertainty; complexity;
   decision making
AB Decision making in universities cannot be implemented in an entirely rational mode because of the effects of the bounded rationality, uncertainty, and complexity inherent to the social and organisational contexts. An empirical case study related to launching a new postgraduate educational programme as the in-depth investigation of the chain of related decisions in one university in Russia was used to explain the features of the decision-making process. Data was gathered through 1) five in-depth interviews with the key stakeholders; 2) observations of the situation stages and interviews with other stakeholders; 3) analysis of governmental documents and standards; and 4) analyses of university policies and local documents. Case analysis showed the unclear authority of the institutions involved, vague rules, exclusion of the important stakeholders from the decision process, a lack of experience and expertise, and unclear procedures. The case was interpreted through the lenses of the organized anarchy theory; power and authority perspective; risk avoidance perspective; and bounded rationality perspective. As a discussion and conclusion, it was shown that some strategies can reduce the level of uncertainty and increase the quality of the decisions made, such as decision analysis perspective, decomposition perspective, participation perspective, information perspective, and groupthink avoidance perspective. Also, the role of political negotiations, information provision, additional actions and meetings organization, systematization of the complicated issues, and organizational learning were considered. All these support more mature solutions in the university context.

DE digital literacy; social network communication culture; digital
   competencies; digital transformation of education
AB The preamble discusses the growing lag behind the digital transformation of the economy and the service sector as a key problem in the Russian education system. The key approaches to the conceptualization of the concept of digital literacy in foreign and Russian research discourse are considered. It is emphasized that various conceptual approaches to the qualitative definition and methods of measuring digital literacy have become the subject of scientific and pedagogical discussions and discussions related to determining the policies of different developed countries in the field of education. There is a shortage of approaches to the analysis of competencies associated with effective communication and adaptation to the social network communication culture of youth. A new conceptualization of social network digital literacy as an element of network digital culture and general digital literacy of generation Z is proposed. Based on the estimates and opinions of representatives of the digital generation identified as a result of a series of field studies in the framework of a research project devoted to the study of the network culture of generation Z, the content is described of the following linguistic, communicative, ethical and self-presenting competencies that form network digital literacy: (1) linguistic competence in the production of different genres of social networking content and effective feedback; (2) communicative competence in organizing contexts of social network communication with various user audiences; (3) practical and normative competence to comply with ethical standards and etiquette requirements and to maintain conflict-free social network communication; (4) competencies of social network self-presentation. It has been suggested that the explication of key skills and behavioral norms that reflect social network digital literacy will allow it to be further monitored through their operationalization as an element of general digital literacy among schoolchildren, students, teachers and higher education teachers. In the conclusion, there is a discussion of a number of issues related to the conceptualization and inclusion / exclusion of individual social network communication skills in the concept of digital literacy (for example, the skills of safe communication in social networks), as well as the specific content of the required skills within the framework of linguistic, communicative, practical ethical and self-presentation competencies.

TI The Scythian Kingdom in the Crimea in the 2nd Century BC and Its
   Relations with the Greek States in the North Pontic Region
SO ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS FROM SCYTHIA TO SIBERIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Greek epigraphy; Late Scythians of the Crimea; Neapolis Scythica; Late
   Scythian culture; Bosporan Kingdom; Olbia; Skiluros; Argotas
AB The new data that have become available in the last two decades show that the Scythian Kingdom with its capital in Neapolis Scythica, which existed in the Crimea in the 2nd century BC, was much closer to Hellenistic states ruled by barbarian dynasties than to nomadic kingdom of the Scythians of the 4th century BC. At the same time, these data allow us to return in part to the old view formulated by Rostovtzeff about continuity between the Scythia of the 4th century BC and the Late Scythian Kingdom, which most researchers have rejected during the last thirty years. It turned out that this continuity existed at least at the ideological level, and the excavations at Ak-Kaya (Vishennoe) filled the chronological gap between the Scythian Kingdoms of the 4th and 2nd century BC. Apparently, Ak-Kaya became one of the political centres of the Scythians as early as the late 4th century BC, before the fall of "Great Scythia", and the capital of the Crimean Scythians was located there before it was moved to Neapolis Scythica. In the formation of Late Scythian culture and the Late Scythian Kingdom with its capital first in Ak-Kaya and then in Neapolis Scythica, apart from the Scythian elements, sedentary Tauri took part, as well as probably the Greeks and the Hellenized population of the Mond of the Greek cities in north-western Crimea. A key role in changing the character of Scythian culture was apparently played by a change in its economic-cultural type and the transition from nomadic pastoralism to settled agriculture. This article proposes a new interpretation of the inscription on the mausoleum of Argotas, discovered in Neapolis Scythica in 1999. Argotas was probably not a Scythian, but a Greek, despite his Scythian name. This Bosporan aristocrat with Scythian family ties married the widowed Bosporan queen Kamasarya in the second quarter of the 2nd century BC and is mentioned as her husband in the inscription cuts 75. He played an important role in governing the Bosporan Kingdom and in protecting it against attacks from the East. Then, most likely after the death of Kamasarya, he moved to the neighbouring kingdom of the Scythians, where he became one of the leading generals, the right-hand man of the king and the tutor to his children. After his death in ca.130-125 BC, he received from King Skiluros unprecedented honours - a heroon in front of the facade of the royal palace was erected for him and, moreover, this was the only truly Greek building in Neapolis Scythica: it was built in accordance with the rules of the architectural order and decorated with Greek statues and reliefs, as well as a metric epitaph with numerous Homeric forms and expressions.

SO OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
LA Russian
DT Article
DE academic mobility; soft power; virtual mobility; higher education; the
   SCO; MOOC
ID EDUCATION
AB Introduction. In the era of globalisation and digitalisation of society, the phenomenon of mobility is of particular relevance in the humanitarian discourse. Technological, socio-political and economic changes, penetrating into the sectors of education and science, contribute to internationalisation, intensification, as well as the inclusive growth of these priority areas of society. The study of academic mobility in the context of the theory of soft power will make it possible quantitatively measure and qualitatively evaluate the information and educational infrastructure as a separate educational and scientific organisation, and the country as a whole.
   The aim of the present research is to comprehensively consider the international academic mobility of students as a component and recourse of the country's soft power in post-industrial realities.
   Methodology and research methods. The methodological framework of the research involves discursive and conceptual approaches. The following general scientific methods were used: comparative and system-structural analysis, synthesis, generalisation and comparative method. Statistical reports and data from global rating systems were analysed and processed through the method of secondary data analysis. The coefficient of rank correlation of the relationship between the number of foreign students in the countries (included in the Top 30 of soft power) and indicators of the rating of the world universities was calculated according to Spirman's rank correlation test.
   Results and scientific novelty. The theories of soft power and academic mobility are synthesised on the basis of an analytical review of scientific publications by European, American, Russian and Chinese scientists. The hypothesis of the close interdependence of these concepts is confirmed. Academic mobility, including the virtual one, is shown to be an important tool for achieving geopolitical and economic goals both in the long-term and short-term perspectives. It is established that academic mobility, on the one hand, is determined from the standpoint of economic and political expediency; on the other hand, as a consequence of the globalisation, transforming the higher education system. While Western researchers emphasise the positive aspects of international law by students and scientists, the Russian scientific discourse is largely focused on the negative trends of this process.
   Two directions of soft power formation in the field of education are identified: training of future leaders (elite) and education of ordinary citizens. The authors revealed the vectors of the discussed type of mobility - Western-centric (Anglo-American) and the new one Asian (Eurasian), in which China and the Chinese language take a special place. It was initiated to establish the SCO University Network among the representatives of member states in order to balance educational flows. The obstacles to its effectiveness are identified.
   Practical significance. The research findings and conclusions extend the knowledge of the possibilities and limitations of the academic mobility realisation to increase university competitiveness.

AB The modern information society builds new forms of communication and forms a space for social relations with the help of the latest means and technologies of communication. This contributes to a number of social and psychological effects: formation of new forms of aggressive behavior, psychological pressure, creation of destructive groups, etc. The article discusses the task of modeling the phenomena of aggression in the socio-cyber-physical environment and studying their influence on the individual and group consciousness of users to develop the provision and creation of a socio-cyberphysical system for managing these processes. The simulation of aggression is required in connection with the need to build a system of control based on an understanding of the mechanisms of aggression launching in the electronic communication. The development of the model involves a theoretical generalization of cross-disciplinary approaches to the analysis of the content of the socio-cyberphysical environment and the formation of concrete recommendations for the detection, recognition and management of destructive effects to individual and mass consciousness. The study was carried out within the framework of a system-functional approach using methods of modeling, experiment, focus groups, content analysis. Electronic communication is considered in its systemic importance to society, and aggression is presented as a phenomenon of meaning and value for social interaction. The study created a classification of user types, established criteria for compliance of the real and virtual user in different types of user practices, established a link between the frequency of application of abnormal and normative aggressive content and the type of profile, identified grounds for the modeling of aggression practices. The results of the study show that it is individual consciousness that serves as the purpose of manipulation within the framework of new forms of communication in the socio-cyberphysical environment. Conclusions were drawn on the impact of technical conditions for communication in socio-cyber-physical reality on the formation of aggression and the high role of anonymity in the practice of aggressive behavior.

TI ON SYMBOLIC ASPECTS OF THE MODERN BELARUSIAN POLITICS OF MEMORY:

DE politics of memory; commemoration; Nationalism; Zapadnorusizm; Belarus
AB The article analyzes the features of building the politics of memory in modern Belarus on the example of symbolic commemoration practices: the creation of new memorials, monuments and museums. By the example of different cases, the author demonstrates how the diverse nature of these new projects clearly reflects the coexistence of several competing lines of memory policy Nationalism and Zapadnorusizm (Westrussianism)-in the modern Belarusian public discourse. At present, the elements of these lines in different proportions are also used in the official discourse of the Belarusian politics of memory. At the official level, the Neo-Soviet narrative prevails, which is focused around the representation of the events of the Great Patriotic War as the key moments for the formation of the Belarusian national identity: the specific core of this narrative is, first of all, the themes of the guerrilla movement and the huge number of victims among the population. The project of Belarusian nationalism is built around three main points: the cultivation of the Belarusian language, the fetishization of the Lithuanian period in the history of Belarus and the postulation of different "blood composition" in Belarusians and Russians. In turn, the project of Zapadnorusizm at the present stage seeks to maintain the idea of a common "Russianness" as a system-forming principle and, as a consequence, to erase the differences within the common cultural, socioeconomic and geopolitical space. The article notes that both of these competing narratives - Nationalism and Zapadnorusizm - are presented unevenly in the Belarusian symbolic space. Using examples of symbolic commemoration, the author demonstrates that the project of Belarusian nationalism is now in a more advantageous position, and, in the case of a conflict of interests, the official Belarusian authorities often give priority to nationalist projects of commemoration, which traditionally have an anti-Russian orientation. The search for national identity leads the Belarusian authorities to incorporate elements of local, usually anti-Russian-oriented nationalism into their official discourse. It is concluded that the practices of symbolic commemoration clearly demonstrate the multi-vector nature of the politics of memory in modern Belarus. The coexistence of these competing projects leads to the fragmentation of historical memory and the hybrid stratification of different narratives of national identity.

TI THE FAMILY CHRONICLE BY SERGEY AKSAKOV AS A PATRIARCHAL IDEAL OF
   SERFDOM AND ITS DEATH VERDICT: A HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL ANALYSIS

DE Sergey Aksakov; Nikolay Dobrolyubov; Stepan Shevyrev; Slavophilism;
   patriarchal ideal
AB In the late 1850s, a surprising fact can be observed. Representatives of the two main social movements in Russia, the Revolutionary Democrats and the Slavophiles (more widely, the Conservatives), equally enthusiastically welcomed the publication of The Family Chronicle by Sergey Aksakov, but the interpretation of this literary work was completely opposite. In the text, the former saw evidence for the conviction of obsolete serfdom orders, the latter the expressive description of the ancient traditional way of life, the basis of age-old economic relations in Russia. In such interpretations, The Family Chronicle suddenly received a serious political content, and the discussion on the book gained social significance. The impetus for the "politicization" of The Family Chronicle was Nikolay Dobrolyubov's article "The Country Life of a Landowner in the Old Years", published in 1858 in the magazine Sovremennik. It was one of the first printed attempts to openly comprehend the phenomenon of serfdom, to condemn it in the time when the question of the liberation of peasants was still far from being resolved. And Aksakov's book, which was about the 18th century, became a highly relevant work for Dobrolyubov. It gave him an opportunity to show the ugly manifestations of serfdom from all sides. Dobrolyubov's impatience with the too slow progress of reforms was reflected in the unjustly sharp conclusions of the article. For the readers of Sovremennik, The Family Chronicle became a work denouncing the old orders, although Aksakov himself could hardly call himself a denouncing writer. The Slavophiles and representatives of the conservative direction could not like this reading of The Family Chronicle. Stepan Shevyrev undertook to restore the true meaning of Aksakov's work in the article "The Childhood Years of Bagrov the Grandson, Serving as a Continuation of "The Family Chronicle" by S. Aksakov", published in Russkaya Beseda, a Slavophile magazine, in 1858. In this article, Shevyrev insisted that Dobrolyubov "did not understand the spirit of the writer's works completely". According to Shevyrev, in a troubled time, Aksakov managed to create a "calmly epic representation of the old Russian life" without making a trial of it and to remind readers about the eternal human values in the images of the old time. This article is an attempt to have a new look at The Family Chronicle and try to reconstruct the social ideal expressed in Aksakov's work. The Family Chronicle shows an example of the creative activity of landlord economy of the 18th century, its effectiveness in terms of the socioeconomic development of the country, and it was patriarchal by the type of relations. Despite the existence of "bad" landlords, Russia held on and grew rich, relying on the active patriarchal landowner "cells of society", which constituted the "healthy" majority. This is what Aksakov showed with his The Family Chronicle at the historical moment when fiction in Russia became a full-fledged supplier of new ideas for Russian life and began to develop images of the social ideal.

DE gender socialization; masculinity reproduction models
AB The article analyzes the features of gender socialization in modern society, i.e. the model of masculinity reproduction. The first part of the article presents social trends that affect socialization in general and gender socialization in particular. First of all, these trends include the changing role of the father in the modern family, the professionalization of parenthood and changes in ideas about hegemonic masculinity, i.e. the formation of the idea of multiple masculinity.
   The second part of the article analyzes key elements of socialization and distinguishes the most relevant models of masculinity reproduction which are based on these elements. According to the authors the basic elements are parenting principles and objectives which are divided into tradition-oriented, gender-neutral, and agents of socialization. Thus, socialization can be focused on and beyond a family and specific features of the socialization process where two approaches can be distinguished (intentional and unintentional).
   Following practical research carried out using qualitative methods and approaches, three models of masculinity reproduction have been identified that are relevant for the present-day society: tradition-oriented, family-oriented, intentional (1), gender-neutral, family-oriented, unintentional (2), tradition-oriented, non-family-oriented, intentional (3). The article considers their substantial features.

DE tank building; flow-conveyor production; "Fordism"; military strategy;
   industrialization; USSR
AB This article analyzes the general aspects of the USSR economy militarization within the context of the military-economic strategy of the Soviet political establishment during the 1930s. The aim of the article is to identify the role and importance of military production assimilation at civilian plants using conveyor methods of production in the political and economic theory and practice of the Soviet Union of the pre-war years. The study combines the methods of intellectual history, historical analysis and synthesis. It is based on an analysis of the ideological premises of the Soviet political and intellectual elites, the processes of introducing new techniques for the production of armored vehicles, and the quantitative indicators of the USSR tank industry of the 1930s. The Soviet political elite believed in the inevitability of the new World War, at the same time recognizing the fact of the USSR's isolation and taking activities to delay the confrontation. Meanwhile, the Soviet military elite, from M.V. Frunze to M.N. Tukhachevsky, considered the military might of a nation to be a direct projection of its economic might. Stalin's theory of "building socialism in a single country" by means of an accelerated industrialization was based on the creation of an "American"-type giant plants of flow-conveyor production of consumer goods ("Fordism"), combined with the economic development of the eastern regions. The Soviet leaders sought to reduce the pressure of the army's requirements on the economy, assimilating military production at the newly created plants. The exemplary case of this strategy is seen in the tank industry. The "tankization" of the Red Army, which became an integral part of the ambitious Soviet military doctrine of the early 1930s, faced numerous difficulties (quality of armor, transmission, tracks, diesel engines). The Soviet tank industry was relatively successful in fulfilling the peace-time plans, but in the case of possible mobilization it remained a matter of concern for the leaders of the state: the defense planning suggested a sharp increase of production in the wartime, relying upon the assimilated newly-built civilian factories with conveyor lines. Evacuation of defense industry in the desperate conditions of Hitler's aggression and the subsequent development of massive tank production by the factories of the Ural region determined the course of World War II, but the authors emphasize that the winning strategy was not "programmed": the evacuation led to the severe loss of quality of tank production. Nonetheless, the key to success was to be found within the framework of the "Fordist" strategy of assimilating military production with the civilian one, which demonstrated prominent efficiency in the organization of tank industry. The conclusion is that, in the long term, it was the strategy chosen at the dawn of Soviet industrialization which allowed the USSR and the Allies to inflict a crushing defeat on the aggressor.

AB In 2019, the countries of Central Europe celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the political system change. In recent years, the analysis of events has most often been limited to the very nature of revolutions, their systemic anti-communist character, to the continuity of anti-regime actions in this part of Europe in the second half of the twentieth century. The author attempts to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the transformation processes, not only emphasizing the most significant achievements of these countries in the spheres of economy, internal and external politics, as well as inconsistency in the field of social policy and ideology, but also considering the changes from three perspectives - the point of view of Western Europe, the socio-political and economic model chosen by these countries in the late 1980s as the ultimate goal of the transformation that began after the breakdown of the old system; from the point of view of Russia, with which they once formed a single political and economic Union and from which they departed 30 years ago; and from the point of view of Budapest, Warsaw, Prague and Bratislava, which have the opportunity over the past three decades to adjust their position on a number of convergence issues. Particular attention is paid to the study of the stages of establishing a new foreign policy of the "Quartet", its relations with the EU and Russia, taking into account the influence of the international economic and political climate on their adjustment. For the first time, an attempt is made to analyze the phenomenon of the Visegrad Group as a regional model of integration in a multicultural space, which had been formed as a single whole for a sufficiently long period of time, and afterwards divided between new subjects of statehood. The model of the Visegrad Group's soft integration may be interesting for Russia as well as for other multicomplex states.

AB The period of Donald Trump's ruling the White House has been marked by a non-typical phenomenon for the USA - the emergence of atmosphere of pressuring by the "white majority" on the Muslim minority. The latteris tending to call it "Open Islamophobia" encouraged by the President's entourage. The American Muslims responded to it in two tracks: through intensifying efforts to annihilate the storm centers of radicalism in their milieu and through establishing a movement of political activists named "Blue Wave" aiming at gaining positions in legislative bodies. It is likely that the topic designated as "Islam and Muslims in America" is getting constant for the political life of this country, and that at all levels - from the local municipalities to the federal Congress. The situation within the Muslim communities in the USA is rather different from that in most European countries with their frequent dominance of one ethnical Muslim group over other ones (North African Arabs in France or Turks in Germany). Given a number of historical reasons, most of Muslim communities have been shaped as multi-ethnical thanks to Islam as a tool and "umbrella" for the people's getting together. Islam became an instrument of self-identification for the natives from different ethnical groupings - Arabs, Pakistanis, Malaysians, Indonesians, etc. It means that unification and integration patterns in interpretation of Islam have been required the most. It actually leads to erosion of the radical potential within the Muslim communities.

Socialists came to power, but after nine months of leading the government they failed to pass the budget for 2019 through the parliament and announced a snap general election that took place in April 2019. For the first time in many years, Sanchez-led PSOE leveraged its short-timed but productive government into a parliamentary majority and then negotiated unsuccessfully with the Podemos party about forming a left-wing government. A new general election, the fourth one in four years, was held on 10 November, 2019, which PSOE won by a broad margin getting 120 seats in the parliament, a number yet insufficient to proceed without allies in order to break the numerical deadlock in the parliament for winning a confidence vote and then the budget approval. Pedro Sanchez is an uncommon personality among a long range of PSOE leaders, a reason why it is interesting to analyze the policy he implements.

AB The articles about Robert Burns and his creative works, written by Soviet writers and published on the pages of Russian periodicals (mainly newspapers) in the 1930s and 1970s are firstly systematized and comprehended in the article. An article written by V.I. Lebedev-Kumach, "The Great Singer of the Scottish People", published in the "Literary Newspaper" on August 15, 1938 became the first material of this kind. This article, which appeared along with the first translations of S.Ya. Marshak, invoked Russian readers to get acquainted and to fall in love with Burns, a wonderful lyric poet and master of songs, at the same time, skillfully placing emphasis on certain aspects of the poet's creative works - his nationality, cheerfulness, love of nature. The poet and translator M.A. Zenkevich in his article "The Scottish Songwriter" (1946), in contrast to V.I. Lebedev-Kumach, focused on the social significance of Burns' works, pointed out the poet's interest to the revolutionary liberation movement, called him "a convinced democrat, a fighter for equality and brotherhood of all working people", noted that the poet's work is imbued with "deep humanity". The articles of A.A.Surkov "In the Land of Burns" (1953) and B.N. Polevoy "In the Homeland of Robert Burns" (1955) reflect the impressions of Soviet writers after a trip to Scotland, visiting of memorial places associated with the name of Burns. If A.A.Surkov chose a lyric tone for his article, then B.N. Polevoy picked out political and social aspects, speaking about the consonance of "great ideas of love for workers, ideas of freedom, peace and friendship of peoples" to the Soviet people, the desire of the Soviet Union "to expand and strengthen cultural ties with all nationalities". In the profound article of A.E. Adalis, "The National Poet" (1959), the edition of the classic collection of Marshak's translations from Burns becomes only an informational reason for the appearance of subsequent deep reflections about the "royal poet" Burns, noble, proud, generous, able to be generous and at the same time sizzling contempt for wealth and nobility. An example of the late Soviet reception of the Burns image can be considered by taking into account the article written by L.N. Vasilyeva "On the day when Robin was born..." (1978), in which the poet's bright personality, his elements of Scottish color (bagpipes, hot haggis) free and fun atmosphere of Burns festivities, in which Moscow schoolchildren "Friends of Scotland Clubs" are participated took the first place. More than others, Burns was written about by his most famous translator S.Ya. Marshak, to whom three journalistic articles and an open letter published in 1956-1960 in the newspaper "Pravda", "Literary newspaper" and the magazine "Education" are belonged. In these articles you can see the impressions of his trips to Scotland, and a valuable response to the creative activities of the predecessors who popularized Burns (in particular, M.Yu. Lermontov, M.L. Mikhailov, E.G. Bagritsky, T. L. Schepkina-Kupernik), and judgments, revealing the originality of the creative laboratory of S.Ya. Marshak, as a translator of Burns, and a holistic view on the creative personality of the great Scottish author.

DE language; ontology; ascription; description; Hart
AB The criticism of "axioms of reference" leads us to a revision of existent views on the character of language functioning and ways of its connection with the reality. One of the ways to connect language and reality is reference, which modern analytic philosophy pays great attention to. At the same time, other aspects of language, the phenomenon of ascriptivism for instance, lack attention. In everyday language, there are expressions which are descriptive in the form but they do not describe any objects. Nevertheless, first, they are not counterintuitive, and, second, their usage leads to different extralinguistic consequences. The specificity of such expressions is being distinguished, and their connection with ontology is being identified. The example of a linguistic expression "the crime that Bill committed" demonstrates that some descriptive expressions are not really descriptions. The use of the expression "the crime that Bill committed" in two possible worlds is different only because crime is defined in different ways in each of the worlds. In case of the first possible world w-1 it is reasonable, whereas in case of the world w-2 it is not. In spite of the fact that a particular situation has happende in both of the possible worlds, in the possible world w-2 there was no occasion which can be indicated by the phrase "the crime that Bill committed". It is concluded that some descriptive expressions do not tend to describe a certain object, but ascribe a certain status to an object. Herbert Hart elaborates the idea of ascription. Ascriptivism by Hart is a characteristic of the language of law. In the article, ascriptivism of everyday language is demonstrated. Thus, for example, the analyzed expression "the crime that Bill committed" can be both the phrase of the language of law and of everyday language depending on the context of its usage. Hart's conception gives an impression that only expressions of the language of law have such qualities as ascriptivism and cancellation. On the example of goal scoring in football, ascriptivism and cancellation in everyday language are demonstrated. Ascriptivism of language represents another, different to the reference, way to connect language and reality. While descriptions point at a certain object, that is refer to it, ascriptive expressions construct ontology ascribing a certain status to an object thus introducing a new object. Such objects as crime, goal and offside do not exist outside the practice of language. For example, having a good reason, circumstances when during the game the ball crosses the line of the gate can be qualified as a goal. However, in the situation of a foul, circumstances when the ball crosses the line of the gate will not be qualified as a goal.

TI THE CURRENT CONCEPTS OF HEALTH: FROM QUALITY OF LIFE TO FULLNESS OF LIFE

DE health; quality of life; fullness of life; concepts of health; social
   change; social networks
AB The article raises the question of the need to supplement modern interpretations of the quality of life with ideas about the fullness of life, reflecting the current social changes to a greater extent. So far, human well-being, articulated as the main goal of social development, is measured by indicators of the quality of life. Among them, health indicators play an important role. They are based on explicit and implicit ideas about what it means to be healthy and sick - the concept of health. Three basic concepts of health were elaborated in the study. The first concept is normative and functional views on health by Talcott Parsons, derived from the description of a balanced, stable society of the mid-20th century with a distinct majority of the middle class, following the requirements of social roles. The second is the concept of healthism, which spread at the turn of the 21st century and considers modern society as a risk society, with the growing individualization and the victory of neo-liberal values. This concept makes individuals be responsible for their own health. The third is a modern understanding of health as an opportunity to live a full life, involving an intense virtual-corporeal experience, which arose in the context of current social changes in the early 21st century. Among these changes, the formation of network and flow structures, alternative to traditional social institutions and leading to the erosion of a single normativity, can be distinguished. A review of the most common health indicators used by Russian research companies in the calculation of the quality of life leads to the conclusion that the transformations in the understanding of health and disease are not taken into account in them, which requires the development of a new understanding of well-being. In the light of current trends, it is not the quality of life, but its fullness, showing how intensely, fully, richly a person can live. In relation to the sphere of health, it is proposed to consider indicators of the fullness of life that reflect the involvement in networks of social interactions. The indicators include, for example, the number of social contacts, communicative inclusion in social networks and sharing, the presence of significant support groups. Further conceptualization of ideas about the fullness of life and the development of appropriate empirical indicators to diagnose its manifestations are important research tasks.

SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Xi Jinping; social sciences; economic reforms; political economy;
   supply-side structural reform
AB The article analyzes the influence of the task set by the Chinese leadership to create "social sciences with Chinese characteristics" based on Marxism, national tradition and Western theories on the advancement of economics in the PRC. China seeks to bring its academic concepts to the outside world to provide foreign experts with tools for the analysis of Chinese development. A special priority is given to the task of constructing political economy of socialism with Chinese characteristics which can give China additional advantages in intellectual rivalry with the West and present a new economic vision to developing countries. The arguments that due to the growth of the country's global influence and the inability of existing theories to explain Chinese practice, new economic theories will certainly emerge in the country, are less and less satisfying to the Chinese academic community. However, the scholars admit that China's superiority in the development of economic theories is in its ability to rely on the rich cultural tradition. The struggle of Chinese researchers for the "right of voice" in economics is aimed at reducing the influence of liberal interpretations of reforms in the country. Problems in the development of political economy in China are attributed not only to Western, but also to Soviet influence. The absence of generally recognized political economy of socialism with Chinese characteristics is explained by insufficient development of productive forces and immaturity of China's economic system. The researchers claim that the generalization of successful experience of economic transformation will be possible only when the country completes the transition to the socialist market economy. The exploration in "political economy of socialism with Chinese characteristics"got intertwined with commenting on "Xi Jinping's economic ideas". Upon the example of the discussion about the relation between supply-side structural reform and Western economic doctrines it was concluded that the emphasis on the involvement with modern economics generates arguments about the lack of independence of Chinese concepts, while emphasis on the uniqueness of Chinese experience calls into question the prospects of creating in China an economic theory with universal significance. In the history of economics there is no precedent of emergence of an outstanding theory based on the "top-down" decision of the national leadership. At the same time, the framework of "philosophy and social sciences with Chinese characteristics" encourages academics to look for a way to combine foreign concepts with Chinese tradition and economic practice of present-day China.

AB The paper shows that now the mainstream of the economic theory is in crisis losing the heuristic potential. There is some positive potential of the institutional approach that is close to (without admitting it) a number of methodological approaches in Marxist political economy (allocation of objective determinants of economic behavior, an implied confession of existence of similar economic systems, emphasis on property relations, etc.) and goes farther than neoclassics. The "failures" of institutionalism are specified, and it is emphasized that in a number of points (especially, in exaggerating the role of institutions - political, in particular - as bases of economic changes) the criticism of R. I. Kapelyushnikov's "pan-institutionalism" is justified but positive proposals of the author, the "ideational" approach, are themselves subject to criticism. The conclusion is drawn that active discussions concerning the methodology and paradigmatic foundations bases of economic theory are on the agenda.

AB In the focus of the present material is the phenomenon of the Cold War between the USSR and the USA. The history of the post-war rivalry between the two superpowers and, what is not less important, mechanisms of its management, have acquired new significance in light of the current state of affairs in international relations with a new edition of a "small Cold War". The author explores main interpretations of the beginning and the end of the Cold War, different approaches to its chronology. A hypothesis is put forward that the detente included substantial attempts to overcome the Cold War and to end it on the basis of international law, de-escalation, a new nature of international relations with marginalized ideology. The centerpiece of the detente was the Helsinki process and the Final Act signed in August 1975. It was predated by a long and exhausting chain of events, bilateral and international treaties, which ushered in the period of "strategic stability". However, the full potential of detente was never realized. Among other sources to support his view, the author richly draws from speeches and works of Andrei Gromyko, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. in 1943-1946, the USSR permanent representative to the UN in 1946-1948, the Soviet foreign minister in 1957-1985. It is shown that the Soviet leadership was ready to revise profoundly its relationship with the West relying on categories of equal security, reciprocity, compromise and trust. The competition between socialism and capitalism was to be won by a political and socio-economic system, which would prove itself more efficient and attractive, not by force and coercion. Peaceful cooperation of different development models has endured as a burning topic in the first third of the 21st century. The author holds that in the 1970s, the intentions of one of the superpowers, expressed by representatives of the top political leadership, was of utmost importance in terms of probability of ending the Cold War.

TI INSTITUTIONAL POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITS OF PROFESSIONAL SELF-REALISATION
   OF RESEARCHERS UNDER THE INNOVATIVE RESTRUCTURING OF RUSSIAN SCIENCE

DT Article
DE status of scientist; development of science; self-realisation of
   scientist; motivation of research workers; Russian science; innovative
   restructuring
AB Introduction. At a time of global economic, social, cultural and political change, it is particularly important to monitor the sustainability of socially important institutions in rapidly changing spheres. Beyond any doubt, the field of science has a special role to play in innovative transformation.
   The aim of the present sociological research is to establish the degree of compliance of the personal, collective and institutional levels of innovative restructuring of Russian science with the challenges of an innovative society. The consistency and integrity of functioning of these levels is one of the key conditions for the professional self-realisation of a modern scientist.
   Methodology and research methods. The methodological basis of the study is the integral individual-system paradigm, which considers the agent of action in the system of rules and resources, limiting the range of choice in the system. Empirical data were collected through an expert semi-formalised survey of researchers in 21 entities of the Russian Federation. The sample (N = 640) consisted of respondents engaged in technical, natural, humanitarian, social and philosophical spheres, higher education system, centres of the Russian Academy of Sciences and state management structures.
   Results and scientific novelty. The institutionalisation of social practices is represented as a synthesis of the field of individual intentions and rules of interaction established in the social field. At the intersection of these fields, standardised social interaction schemes are being transformed and new behaviours and actions are emerging.
   The present research for the first time applied a three-level model of institutionalisation of science in an innovative environment, which allowed correlating the personal, organisational and systemic factors of disclosure of the intellectual potential of the scientist. Moreover, this resulted in identifying the existing contradictions between the personal motivation of agents of scientific activity and mechanisms, which structure the work of scientific organisations and the system of indicators of their effectiveness approved by the state. The survey data demonstrated stable motivation of Russian scientists for professional self-realisation and active scientific search, based on personal responsibility, understanding of the social significance of their research, or less frequently based on the membership of a successful team. However, serious institutional barriers have been identified to optimise the working conditions of scientists. The institutional barriers include: the administrative difficulties of establishing strong professional links with production, social and power structures; the lack of opportunities to participate in global scientific discourse; the narrow functionality of scientific organisations as an intermediate link between scientists and the state; the reluctance of expert scientific community to develop the criteria and indicators of the quality of scientific activity; the non-compliance of these indicators with innovative priorities and goals, etc.
   Practical significance. The research results and proposals can be used to adjust the state policy of the Russian Federation and the principles of management of the organisation in accordance with the innovative priorities of the society.

AB The article discusses the Russian state-legal doctrines as a scientific category with a set of specific features. The authors analyze the definitions of legal doctrine offered in the Russian political and legal discourse, and on the basis of this, they put forward their own definitions of both legal doctrine and state legal doctrine. The results of the research are of decisive importance for the history of political and legal studies, the general theory of law, and the philosophy of law, but at the same time, they can be used in other areas of legal (including branch) science.

DE State Duma; Russian Empire; national question; national culture;
   education; North Caucasian deputies
AB The objective of the study is to analyze the activities of the North Caucasian deputies of the third-convocation State Duma of the Russian Empire in addressing issues of education and national culture. The people's deputies were focusing on the most relevant and vital questions of the Russian reality: democratization of political life, the problem of national and religious relations, education and enlightement, as well as many others. The role of North Caucasian deputies in the consideration of draft laws on the development of national education and the empowerment of indigenous languages of the region is defined. The analysis of the transcripts shows that the people's deputies constantly paid attention to the violation of the civil rights of the local population and discrimination on religious and national grounds (in particular, the prohibition of local judicial proceedings in the native language). In the State Duma of the third convocation, the North Caucasian deputies were able to amend the law "On the Transformation of the Local Courts", according to which judges were obliged to speak local languages (the law was approved by the Emperor on June 15, 1912). They also supported bills on the development of teaching in local languages, on the establishment of national and religious equality, on the development of culture and school management.
   After analyzing the materials and sources, the author comes to the conclusion about the high activity of the deputies in the elaboration of religious bills, as well as in solving the problems of national culture and education. However, the establishment of the June 3rd model of formation of the Duma led to ignoring the need for representation of the outskirts of the Empire in the all-Russian Parliament, which, in turn, brought about the stagnation and subsequent collapse of the entire political system.

AB The article focuses on the anti-Bolshevik media perception and interpretation of the events in Eastern Europe related to the end of the First World War and the resolution of the Carpathian issue at the Paris Peace Conference. Drawing on the newspaper Karpatorusskoe slovo, the official organ of the Central Carpathian Council,and other progovernment periodicals in eastern Russia, the author identifies the main explanatory models and argumentation strategies that were significant for self-identification, self-representation and formation of a single discursive space of the Central Carpathian Council and the Russian government of Admiral A.V. Kolchak. The end of the First World War, along with jubilation over the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the liberation from the "centuries-old Teutonic-Magyar yoke", caused the leaders of the Siberian community of Carpathians (Rusins) to feel uncertain, concerned and anxious about the future of their people. This feeling increased due to the dispersion of Rusins across countries and continents, their lack of a single political centre, and weaker influence of Russia after the Empire collapse that resulted in the formation of several competing states on its territory, conclusion of a separate peace treaty between the Bolsheviks and the Central Powers and possible claims of both existing (Romania, Hungary) and newly formed (Poland, Czechoslovakia) East European states to the territory of Carpathian Rus. Initial hopes for a new, fair world order based on the principle of national self-determination,the consolidation of the territory of Carpathian Rus as part of the revived Russian state give way to doubts and disenchantment with the allies. In this situation,the Central Carpathian Council as the leading socio-political centre of the Rusins in the Urals and Siberia relies on its own forces and a closer alliance with the Russian government by Admiral A.V. Kolchak.

ID PROTEST
AB The article is devoted to the contemporary context and features of the new social movements' inner communication. The authors pay special attention to the conceptual meaning and consequences of the activists' use of the digital communication. Judging upon the theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of the activists' communication, the authors note that protest activity is seen as a reaction on the failure of communicative practices. But such an interpretation negates the constructive components typical for the current civil activity as a subject of communication of a new type. It is noted in the article that contemporary civil activity is based on the principles of a personal initiative inclusion rather than on a formal organizational membership like during the pre-digital era. Based on the ideas of the systemic communicative theory, the authors propose to consider civil activism as invariant communicative structures and note that activity's coordination is ensured by the discourse of activists' discussion or action. The authors claim that such a mechanism of coordination of the activists' organization could be interpreted as the priority of quasi-artificial intelligence in which specific "neurons" (that are represented by activists or discussion communities) communicate with discussion centers (these are network associations) through quasi-synaptic mechanisms (that are represented by the reaction to problems or events indicated in social networks). As it is noted in the article, if the reaction variety to "digitally discussed" events intensifies, several quasi-neural levels are formed (these are the levels of the network reaction to external network events, of the reaction to the reaction to non-network events, of active discussion). In turn, if activist unions are regularly disturbed by low-weight quasi-synaptic mechanisms (message of an insignificant or fake character), the protest communication reduces. The authors note that the horizontal rhizomatic structure of traditional activist movements, their decentralization and the low formalization of protest mobilization during the pre-digital era were objectively limited by the weak internal consolidation of associations. Asking a question about the conditions of network communities' coordination of their activity, the authors propose to reconstruct the activity of social networks by analogy with the structure of the organic nervous system or with the work of a complex mechanism. It is noted in the article that the "network" formed by the activist communication moves the internal logic of the participants' communication into a new more ordered format. It mainly concerns the making of collectively-binding decisions. The network mechanism of decision-making that is used by contemporary activist associations helps to compensate the deficit of central governance structures that was typical for the pre-digital era. As the authors note, the "self-learning" of the communicative system becomes possible due to the activist network's response to non-network events. That thus corresponds to the classical mechanisms of a positive feedback when more participation in activist actions generates a more active network's discussion of the actual context.

DT Article
DE argumentation theory; argumentation structure; DefLog; logic of
   argumentation; defeasible logic
AB The author shows that, when formalizing discussions that take place in modern philosophical journals, it is necessary to take into account the fact that a new discussion participant can use the preceding discussion as a whole in order to support his/her own claim. This means that the constructed formalization must operate with objects that are entire discussions, which contain statements related by relations of support and attack. The author gives some examples of discussions that are attacked as a whole or supported (some claims) as a whole. He shows that, in order for those discussions to fulfill this role, they must be substantiated or objectified, i.e. our logical means should allow us to represent discussions as a single object, distinct from other objects. The author show that, for example, both B. Verheij's Theory of Dialectical Argumentation DefLog and E.N. Lisanyuk's Logical-Cognitive Argumentation Theory do not enable to objectify some common types of discussions, and therefore these theories are to be extended. To wit, the author shows that these theories are not capable of describing the following three situations in their languages. (1) Two agents support their claims, each of them gives an argument in support of his/her claim, and each of those supports is also an attack on the opponent's claim. After that, a third agent treats the situation entirely as a dead end and uses it as a support for his/her own thesis. (2) The first agent, based on his/her initial premises, has to admit the first statement to be supported, then, based on it and on the initial premises, s/he has to admit the second statement to be supported, etc. ad infinitum. The second agent attacks the entire infinite regress generated in this way, i.e. s/he attacks the entire sequence of statements related by the relation of support. In the attacking statement, the second agent asserts that the sequence of supports cannot go to infinity. (3) The first agent puts forward two positions supporting each other. The second agent attacks the entire "circular" supporting indicating that it is unacceptable for something to be supported by itself.

TI Sending Workers from Hebei Province to the USSR in 1955. From the

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Chinese workers; Hebei; Soviet-Chinese relations
AB The article focuses on the problems of recruitment and dispatch of Chinese workers from Hebei Province to the USSR in 1955. Due to the political situation and the inaccessibility of sources of Chinese origin, these events have not received sufficient attention in the Russian historical science. Chinese historians have been working on this topic together with Russian researchers since recently. They work with the aim of identifying and publishing sources. The dispatch of Chinese workers to Russia resulted from close cooperation between the USSR and the PRC in the 1950s. Negotiations on this issue were held at the end of 1954, and final decision was made in early 1955. It was planned to send 80,000 Chinese workers from different provinces of China, including Hebei, to 22 Russian regions and to Kazakhstan. However, during the project's implementation, in the spring of 1955, the plan was amended. As a result, only in the form of an experiment, it was agreed that several thousands of Chinese workers be sent to the USSR. The first region of China, which successfully solved the task of recruiting workers and was selected to be the first, was Hebei Province. On May 4, 1955, representatives of two countries agreed on plans to send to the USSR one thousand Chinese workers from Qingyuan County. In July 1955, two batches of Chinese workers were sent from the Baoding station to Transbaikal (Zabaykalsky Krai). Workers from Hebei were divided into three groups, staying at new work sites along the route: a plant in the region at the border of Buryatia with Mongolia, in Usolye-Sibirsky, Irkutsk Oblast, and in Perm (Molotov). The last group arrived in Molotov on July 21, 1955. In 1956, the second group of Chinese workers, recruited in the provinces of Shandong and Henan, arrived in the USSR. Chinese workers operated in construction, mining and other enterprises, in various positions and specialties, taking advantage of all social rights and privileges that existed in the USSR. After the end of a three-year contract in 1958, most Chinese workers extended their contracts, some returned home. A significant part of Chinese workers from Hebei extended their contracts for a third term. However, at the last stage of Chinese work in the USSR, in the early 1960s, not much remained from the former Russian-Chinese friendship. In 1963, the last Chinese workers returned to their homeland in the conditions of a "cold war" between the two countries. Not all Chinese workers returned home: some of them died and were buried in Russian cemeteries, monuments in their honor were built in Perm, Usolye-Sibirsky and other cities in May 1963. The long-term presence of Chinese labor migrants in Siberian cities is an important and integral part of Russian-Chinese history, interaction and cooperation. However, the cold war that ensued between the Soviet Union and the PRC had a negative effect on the entire project thereby scaling down its positive impacts.

DE semantic paradox; Yablo's paradox; liar paradox; circularity;
   self-reference
AB The article is a critical essay of Evgeny Borisov's research, which examines the logical structure and meaning of infinite semantic paradoxes (in particular, Yablo's paradox). According to his view, the strict formalization of the infinite sequence of sentences in Yablo's paradox requires self-referential circularity descriptions. This view is based on Priest's argument that a uniform representation of the content for Yablo's paradoxical sentences can only be given by means of the two-place predicate of satisfaction. But it guarantees the existence of a fixed point for each sentence of Yablo's paradox. Thus, we need to agree that Yablo's paradox does involve circularity of a self-referential kind. However, Borisov believes that Priest's argument is not sufficient for such a conclusion. His disagreement with Priest's conclusion is based on the consideration of Sorensen's and Beall's metalanguage arguments. According to Sorensen, the specific properties of our formal (technical) descriptions are not inherited by the objects of such descriptions. On the contrary, Beall states that finite beings such as ourselves can know nothing about the actual infinity by demonstration. We cannot know how Yablo's paradox could be represented in an arithmetic language without the help of descriptions. Priest's argument shows that any such description is circular. It means that any entity generated by self-referential circularity description is itself circular. Comparing Sorensen's and Beall's arguments, Borisov states his own skeptical argument. He claims that the need to use circular descriptions is not a reliable evidence of the circularity of Yablo's paradox. An alternative to Borisov's skeptical views is the dilemmic argument that Yablo's paradox either does involve circularity of a self-referential kind or is not an example of a genuine semantic paradox. This view is based on the arguments of Cook and Ketland. According to Cook, we can unwind any finite semantic paradox to an infinite structure. Unwinding is a paradoxicality-preserving operation for replacing a sentence which says of itself with an infinite sequence of sentences which say of their successors. It shows that Yablo's paradox is just an original example of circulus vitiosus. Ketland claims that Yablo's paradox can be strictly formalized as an infinite conjunction of sentence tokens without using the predicate of truth (or satisfaction). It allows showing that Yablo's infinite sequence is not a genuine semantic paradox, but rather a omega-paradox.

AB The article examines the place and role of the Holocaust in today's German commemoration practices in the framework of the policy of denazification. The study focuses on the analysis of the Holocaust education, its development throughout history and its main components. One of the main objectives of the article is to scrutinize the acute problems of modem German patterns of remembrance culture in German educational policy in terms of reasons, the course and results of World War II and the Holocaust as a culmination of ethnic cleansing conducted by Third Reich. The historical analysis of the process of denazification after World War II showed that the representation of the Holocaust and policy of memory were developing in accordance with the paradigm of German memorial culture originated from the Nuremberg trials. They were the basis for democratic, tolerant and peaceful society in the framework of educational policy. In spite of debate and controversy within the EU, the Holocaust education assuming a more important role in the life of society, served as a key element for establishing a trans-European identity. The possibility of reconsidering historical memory, which stems from modem social and political processes, does not imply the revision of the results of the war or the denial of historical guilt in German educational programs at the federal and regional levels. The programs will be based on democratic principles and created by means of active participation of the German society, which the Holocaust remembrance culture was transmitted to through the educational system. Consequently, the Holocaust is becoming an integral part of the German identity and plays a major role in shaping democratic beliefs and active civic stance of the German youth.

AB The present paper studies the mass and uncontrollable streams of migrants into the European Union (EU) starting from 2014. In scientific and public discourse, this phenomenon was called the "migratory crisis". The paper analyzes the causes of forced migration from Africa and the Middle East, which is characterized both by national and global problems. The authors reveal the ambiguous position of EU member states with respect to the illegal migration and identify two basic approaches, which were formed in the course of political discussions concerning this crisis in the context of EU safety. In particular, the research shows the changes in the content of threats to the EU member states, caused by the uncontrollable migration in the recent decades. The article presents a survey of the fundamental characteristics of migratory crisis, the measures developed by the EU structures for its overcoming and the results of their implementation.

AB Elections to the European Parliament to be held in May 2019 became a true political contest for the first time. Their results will influence further institutional reforms in the European Union, as well as have a decisive impact on prospects for democratization of the EU political system. Expert community does not doubt that with these elections we shall see the end of the long-term duopoly of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats in the EP, while the numbers of its Members (MEPs) representing populist radical parties of the right, will grow substantially. This article proposes a comprehensive examination of national voting systems applied to MEPs' elections, including electoral threshold, constituencies, ballot type and distribution of seats. The authors scrutinize the e f fect of each variety and show which of them favour mainstream parties and which are more favourable to small (radical) parties. It is argued that these varieties may have some impact on the final allocation of seats in the ER Furthermore, it is widely used by some national governments in order to withstand further radicalization of the European Parliament. Special attention is paid to the expectable transformations of the European party groups. To begin with, the schism of the most numerous European People's Party (EPP) cannot be excluded, once it loses its own Eurosceptical wing. Second, the future o f the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy party group remains undecided, as it depends on participation within its ranks of the United Kingdom Independence Party. At the same time, representatives of populist and radical parties can unite, thus launching a serious challenge against the mainstream parties, standing for European integration. An onward analysis of the new political dynamics in the integrated Europe is built in the article around the outlook for the appointment at the end of 2019 or a bit later of the new president of the European Commission, the key institution in the European system of governance, to be determined by the decision of the European Council and the European Parliament. This analysis leads to a conclusion that in fact, the chances of Manfred Weber from the European People's Party, generally regarded as a frontrunner of the present electoral race, are not as sound as it appears.

AB The main goal of the paper is to analyze ideas and practices involved in the transmission of the Russian language and culture among members of Russian -speaking diaspora in the United States, mostly belonging to the two recent waves of immigration from the Soviet Union and Russia and residing in different parts of America. The bulk of academic publications for this paper were released in Russia with some from the US. Three methods were used: a questionnaire (80 questions, both open-ended and closed distributed via google form among middle-age and young members of the Russian -speaking community - 52 respondents), semi-structured interviews (a total of 20) and participant observation, primarily in Boston area and Ann Arbor, MI. When reflecting on affiliation with the Russian-speaking world the preservation of language and its transmission to future generations is viewed as the most important element of everyday life and aspiration for the Russian-speaking population regardless of their ethnic origin, religious beliefs, political preferences and social status. This attitude, perceived as critical for preserving cultural identity, appears to be true even for cases when such transmission did not prove to be successful.

ID BILINGUALISM
AB This article aims to trace how multilingualism as a phenomenon of human culture is changing. Multilingualism is interpreted both as a social phenomenon and as a set of diverse practices of language use. The analysis of factors affecting the quality of multilingualism is carried out in line with the theory of social change. The article considers the geographical, social and media factors affecting the growth and functioning of multilingualism in the diachronic perspective. Despite the uneven spread of multilingualism, both among social groups and geographically, at the moment it is a qualitatively and quantitatively different phenomenon. Although the human race has been accompanied by multilingualism throughout its history, the emergence of national states has led to the consolidation of the notion of monolingualism as a norm. Today, in a globalizing world, we observe a departure from the monolingual paradigm. Multilingualism is positively perceived by both the general public and researchers. Foreign language proficiency is becoming an essential component of communicative literacy. This applies to the wide sectors of the population, not to the elites and individual social groups as before. The multilingualism of people and societies has increased so much that we can speak about the emergence of a multilingual economy or linguanomics. Not all languages are equally in demand in linguanomics: the so called world languages are more attractive. This phenomenon is criticized as linguistic imperialism. With the introduction of digital technologies, access to foreign language information is exceptionally fast and easy. These technologies, combined with mobility of different types, give rise to a situation of translocality in which the changing language environment remains connected to the native language space. The analysis shows that in the context of globalization multilingualism becomes an emergent phenomenon that produces a systemic effect in a global perspective.

DE political myth; "archaic" and "conjunctural" ("instrumental") levels of
   contemporary myth; narrative; conflict between levels of myth
AB The article presents the contemporary social myth as a phenomenon that is realized at two levels - "archaic" and "conjunctural" ("instrumental"). At the "archaic" level, there are stable archetypes, images, mythologems, rituals that are developed mainly collectively, while at the "conjunctural" level, a kind of "mythology of ideas" is found - the results of a rational purposeful activity of individual mythmakers often appearing as ideologies. The political myth, understood as a kind of a social myth, dominates at the "conjunctural" level that expresses the interests of the political class. The specificity of the political myth is that this kind of myth constantly seeks to demonstrate its "archaic" roots while being located mainly at the "conjunctural" level. The danger and ambiguity of the consequences associated with the functioning of the political myth in society are noted; they are explained by the unpredictability of the activities of mythmakers and elites. The most important role in political mythmaking belongs to narratives. The author asks a question about the degree of the political myths' impact on society, primarily on the commemorative practices, and identifies a number of factors that determine the scale of this impact. Special attention is paid to the levels of narration; they are compared with the levels of a contemporary myth. The article emphasizes the decisive importance of the fact that all the levels of narration and myth have been completely implemented and successfully broadcast. The author believes that in the development of the system of narration there may occur conflicts between the "archaic" and "conjunctural" ("instrumental") levels of the contemporary myth. The emergence of this internal conflict of the contemporary political myth is favored by the absence of the following organic combination: on the one hand, the elements of the "archaic" level of the myth, associated with traditional mythologems and classic plots, and, on the other hand, the elements of the "conjunctural" ("instrumental") level, filled with ideas and meanings of mythmakers who are trying not to fall out of the changing political situation, the current agenda. Narratives can act as a primary means of gaining political myth internal organics. The storyline of the narrative, which is part of the myth, combines the archaic and the modern, the individual and the collective, the unique and the general. As a means of overcoming the conflict between the levels of the myth, narratives perform a function similar to Claude Levi-Strauss' myth. But now the place of the classical myth in the role of the mediator is taken by a rhetorical narrative figure which is included in the plot, in the outline.

   Search for its Language in the nineteenth century
SO HISTORY OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Habsburg Empire; imperial science; science and nation-building;
   scientific language; Ukraine
AB Ukrainian science and its terminology in the nineteenth century experienced a number of twists and turns. Divided between two empires, it lacked institutions, scholars pursuing it, and a unified literary language. One could even say that until the late nineteenth century there was a possibility for two communities with two literary languages to emerge - Ruthenian (Habsburg Empire) and Ukrainian (Russian Empire). Eventually, both communities and languages merged. This article tracks the meanderings of this process, arguing that scholarly publications played a crucial role in shaping the standard for the scientific language. The article follows the biography of the naturalist Ivan Verhrats'kyi (1846-1919), the author of the first dictionaries of naturalist terminology in Ruthenian in 1860, a translator and author of textbooks, and the head of the Mathematical-Naturalist-Medical Section of the Shevchenko Society in L'viv. He thus shaped many Ruthenian, and then Ruthenian-Ukrainian scholarly projects. Initially successful with his approach to making the Ruthenian scientific language vernacular, in the 1890s his approach was losing ground to the internationalization of vocabulary and to the growing pressure toward the unification of Ruthenian and Ukrainian. Finally, in the beginning of the twentieth century, Verhrats'kyi became marginalized within the Ukrainian scholarly community. By discussing the history of a minority language within imperial structures, I argue that the media in which scholarly work was published requires special attention. In the Ruthenin-Ukrainian case, they determined the standard for scientific language. Lacking professional journals, Ruthenian scholars published in the 1860s-late 1880s in popular newspapers and in school textbooks, requiring them to use a language that was near to the spoken tongue of the Habsburg province. Once the political situation changed, favoring Ruthenian-Ukrainian unification, and scholarly journals appeared and transgressed the imperial boundary, the favored language had to be transimperial, ousting out the vernacular.

DE authorial paroemiology; generalized structural model of source

AB The aim of the present article consists in the linguistic and semiotic and cultural-historical analysis of author's proverbs, sayings and proverbial expressions of the Russian language of the period of 1905-07 that were formed on the basis of generalized structural models of paroemias functioning in language on the example of the following revealed language units: Any cattle goes to the yard; For some people he is a gendarme, for others he is simply a good man; The characteristics of the budget done always depend on ministers who do it. The revealed units are analyzed according to the following scheme: (1) on the basis of the dictionaries of Russian proverbs and sayings, the paroemia that is the source of transformation is determined; (2) the judgment the paroemia expresses is given; (3) on the basis of a comparison of the component structure of a paroemia source and the judgment it expresses, its type is determined (a proverb, a saying, proverbial expression); (4) block diagrams of a paroemia source and the author's paroemia formed on its basis are provided; (5) the author's paroemia and its system prototype are classified as belonging to a specific higher logical and semiotic invariant objectifying the typical situation underlying the initial paroemia and its transformation; (6) logical and thematic groups are defined whose composition includes the source paroemia and the author's paroemia; (7) the meanings of the component words of the analyzed author's paroemia and (if possible) the sum of these meanings are given; (8) the extra-linguistic context that led to the emergence of the new paroemia is analyzed; (9) a brief, informative description of other materials published in the same journal issues as the author's paroemias under study is given (this is necessary to confirm the correctness of the "reading" of the content of the author's paroemias), (10) the author's judgment(s) expressed in the paroemia is (are) formulated, (11) the type of the author's paroemia is determined. The research was done with the usage of the method of structural (linguistic and semiotics) analysis of paroemias developed by G.L. Permyakov, descriptive and comparative methods, which included methods of component analysis, dictionary definition analysis and wide extra-linguistic context analysis. Due to the lack of a uniform approach to the definition of the paroemia and the author's paroemia in linguistics, the author of the article briefly explains his positions on these issues. The author also indicates the specificity of author's paroemias formed on the basis of generalized structural models of source paroemias. During the analysis, it was established that the considered author's paroemias and paroemia prototypes whose generalized models were used for creation of new language units are parts of the same highest logic and semiotic invariant groups, which is one of scientific justifications of the "recognition" of initial structural and semantic bases of paroemias. The analysis has shown that the attribution of the paroemia prototypes and the author's paroemias formed on their basis to the same logical-thematic groups is optional. The article presents the judgments expressed by the author's paroemias, their types are determined. The final part of the article outlines the prospects for further research on the author's paroemias of the Russian language of 1905-07.

AB In this article, the authors propose a new version of a natural deduction system for a typed lambda calculus of concepts as functional abstracts in Frege's fashion. The introductory section provides a general description of the approach. In so doing, the authors briefly consider different theories of concepts and Fregean ideas among them. Next, the authors introduce their conception of neurophenomenology as far as the cognitive procedure of categorization is concerned. They also describe their previous results in the formal (logical) representation of concepts as functions. The second section introduces the calculus of concrete concepts (concepts whose extensions consist of substances) as a natural deduction system. The authors consider concepts as object-to-object functions expressing the result of the cognitive processing of perceptive stimuli. The current version of this calculus is designed to establish standard relations between concepts and, first of all, the inclusion relation, which allows specifying the remaining fundamental and secondary relations. The consequence relation between two concepts means that the extension of the first is included into the extension of the second. The authors formalize both simple and complex types of objects constructed with the help of operations that are analogs of conjunction, disjunction and negation. The section ends with the discussion of the meaning of some rules of inference. In the final part of the article, the authors sum up the findings and outline the prospect of further research in this area. The prospect is, first of all, the construction of adequate semantics for the proposed calculus and extension of the calculus to the case of quantified attributes. This calculus could be further modified in an obvious way to provide a formal representation of abstract concepts. All this allows considering the prospects of this formalism for computer science and the project of artificial intelligence in the field of knowledge representation and processing, as well as for modeling the machine learning process (in particular, instance-based learning).

AB The article analyzes the situation in the field of noble land tenure of the Middle Volga region. The study was carried out on the basis of a combination of methods of various sciences: historical, economic and statistical. Such methods as comparative historical, systemic, quantitative, problem-chronological were used in the process of research. The main causes of negative dynamics in this area were identified; Numerous figures confirm the conclusion that almost all the studied indicators had a pronounced negative trend. The activity of the State Noble Land Bank is shown; its role in the processes of mobilization of noble land ownership is considered. The analysis of the dynamics of the main operations carried out by the bank noted significant fluctuations in the number and volume of loans granted, which was caused, first and foremost, by reasons of a socio-political nature.

AB The article discusses the theoretical and methodological problems of actively developing in modern conditions ecological culture, determining its place in the system of humanities. The growing importance of new conception of scientific research and sociocultural practices in the context of the global problems of our time is determined.
   It is necessary to know the experts' opinion which environmental problems are being identified as most significant. Only afterwards we can find the ways to solve them. Thereby based on the analysis of materials of the Russian scientific-practical conference with international participation "Environmental protection as a factor of the socio-economic development of municipalities: experience and problems" (2017, Rostov-on-Don, Kurgan), and the results of the Russian expert opinion research conducted by scientists of Rostov scientific elitological school it was concluded that there is an objective necessity to create a unified structure of natural resource management and environmental protection in territorial entities (Vorontsov, Mamychev, Ponedelkov, Yanguzin and Vildanov, 2017; Ponedelkov, Starostin, Mamychev, Grigoryan and Verenich, 2018). At the same time, the prerequisites and trends, the problematic aspects of the development of environmentally-oriented processes in modern Russian conditions determine that the organization of an effective environmental protection policy as a factor of socio-economic development and mechanisms of the implementation its strategic goals in the field of environmental development existing public administration system is possible only if appropriate conditions are created for the dynamic development of the system of environmental education and upbringing, as well as the necessity of developing the implementation of a new civilizational paradigm as a new eco-human behavioral paradigm

DT Book Review
DE platform capitalism; digital economy; political economy; economic
   history; social theory; capitalism; critique
AB Nick Srnicek writes a convincing history of the modern digital economy, which has managed to develop numerous myths, hoaxes, and prescientific interpretations. Critical reconstruction of the events that preceded the birth and explosive growth of the digital technologies and products market, on the one hand, avoids their perception and understanding in the self-evident logic of the field (market), and on the other hand, provides an opportunity to perceive the future of digital capitalism. Srnicek is consistently detached from an optimistic view of the economy of the recent past and the near future. However, his argument does not involve discussions between "technopessimists" and "technoptimists," rather Srnicek analyzes the digital economy and the model of platforms in the logic of a capitalist mode of production and a ruthless competitive race. Its intrinsic logic determines the sequence of economic agents' actions and the possible image of the future. The crisis dynamics of capitalism of the last decades provide limited space for historical maneuvering and less and less space for political action, so any normative statements mostly lose their power. The analysis focuses on the business model of platforms from the perspective of the historical logic of capitalism aimed at seeking a new source of profitability in the condition of market exhaustion. This condition leads to a redefinition of PO the key categories of perception of the role of technologies in everyday life and in the scale of the economic system in terms of political economy.
   The reviewer gives a patient exposition of the basic concepts of the book and the theses on which Srnicek's analysis is based. The text is mainly focused on the reconstruction of the main point of the book but also appeals to an important author for Srnicek, the historian Robert Brenner. The review concludes with a modest critical commentary on the book and a call for a Russian-language discussion of the book, which has already become very influential abroad.

AB The centuries-old history of Kurds, who inhabit an intersection straddling the territory of the Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asia, is replete with tragic events that have been laid down in the collective memory of the Kurdish people. Kurds have remained to be a divided ethnic group residing in the cross-border regions of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria. Kurds entered into complicated relationships with the titular nations of these states, which sometimes grew into fierce conflicts, including even Iraq where Kurds succeeded in gaining broader powers of autonomy. This factor has caused an increasingly tangible impact on the policies of the Middle Eastern states, as well as on global affairs. The underlying disunity is a salient feature of the Kurds' relations with external actors, but it is also an inherent element of the relationships among themselves. Wide-ranging differences in the ethno-confessional structure, language, culture, customs and traditions, self-identification and interests of the elites provide a substantiation to refer the communities with Kurdish residents to the "deeply divided" category. That is why the theory of deeply divided societies is the most efficient mechanism for conducting research into the Kurdish communities, alongside the theories of symbolic politics and social movement. The article reviews the problem of Kirkuk considered as a contentious and disputed hybrid territory: the topic has recently been enthusiastically tackled in a highly relevant discourse among researchers. The development of the situation in the region, including the growing sense of the Kurds' national identity, allows us to assume that the Kurdish problem is not likely to lose its political poignancy in the foreseeable future, remaining a factor capable of generating a conflict within the states of Kurdish settlements.

DT Review
DE gender; feminism; Russian history; gender and history
AB The article reviews the works of gender studies published over the past 30 years, with the aim to show and generalize what is proposed in historiography and special literature about the relationship between historical sciences and gender studies. Firstly, the paper offers an updated concept of gender in relation to the different periods of the country's history - tsarist, Soviet and post-Soviet. Secondly, the paper discusses the formation and gradual development of gender studies and gender discourse. The study reveals an uneven growth in the number of descriptive and empirical gender studies, which can be explained in correlation with socio-economic and political changes throughout Russia's historical path. The correlation between the dynamic evolution of gender and the peculiarities of the historical path of the country has not been sufficiently studied; its analysis offers historians the opportunity to describe and explain the unique models of male/female (gender) relations and their evolution. So far gender studies have little to off er that would help identify, describe and explain the national specificity of gender, correlated with the specifics of national history in chronological and spatial-territorial terms. Future historians should also focus on developing methodological tools and a language that can foster interaction between historical, post-structuralist and feminist approaches. This will require a drastic transition in historical research to previously ignored topics and to more innovative, in-depth and qualitative research methods, such as the history of the life of ethnic groups and peoples of Russia at different stages of development of state and society next to case studies of gender and discourse analysis.

Major foreign and domestic political resolutions are analyzed, as well as the attitude to them of the parliamentary factions. The most significant phenomenon of the elections in 2019 is the high turnout, as well as the weakening of the parliamentary positions of the traditional favorites of the elections in the EP - demochristians, conservatives and social democrats, along with the increase in the representation of nationalists and environmentalists. The author concludes that the mosaic composition of the EP will complicate its work, the interaction of various European parliamentary structures. The search for consensus in important decisions will be problematic. Increase the responsibility for the harmonisation of this process, Three main factions of the EP - demochristian, social Democrats and liberals. The issue "EP and Russia" will remain one of the important directions of the past and future activities of the European Parliament.

DE anthropology of innovation; philosophical anthropology; innovation;
   creative; posthuman; transhumanism
AB Innovations are considered now as a new kind of symbol of the spirit. Innovative achievements measure the effectiveness and social significance of various fields of activity. One of the most important trends today is the innovative race, the competition of innovations; their production is a modern trend. The bet on innovation generates a situation of euphoria in relation to them. Innovation is a stable element of economic, management, political and technical (engineering) discourses; innovations have been quite clearly defined in the relevant fields of science. At the same time, the value of innovation is self-sufficient, and the immediate goals and objectives of innovation are closed within the framework of the activity and pragmatic approaches, in which the "logic of things" dominates. The scheme of the innovation process - from investment and development to obtaining "additional value", quality growth - does not take into account the ultimate goal and general meaning of this process; it does not represent the "human dimension" of innovation. There is a problematic situation, the content of which is determined by the existing contradiction: on the one hand, innovations are viewed as the main and universal means of progressing; on the other hand, innovations have not yet received a universal comprehension commensurate to their value; being an object of a "calculating thinking", they have not yet become an object of a "reflective thinking" or a philosophical reflection. Meanwhile, innovative products, ideas and technologies increasingly claim not only to transform the external world of people, but also their nature. Therefore, ideas, projects and programs of innovative development, transhumanism, of supporters of a posthuman future, of wide application of NBIC technologies need a philosophical "expert examination". The aim of this article is to substantiate the necessity and possibility of a philosophical reflection, to comprehend innovations in the context of people's individual and shared existence. This context determines the subject area of the anthropology of innovation, in which they are considered in their ontological, axiological, humanistic, social and cultural aspects. On the basis of the method of abduction, using the methodological and theoretical resources of philosophical anthropology, the authors make a humanitarian and humanistic interpretation of innovations, in which the axiological and semantic orientation of a person is emphasised, and the question "What is a human?" is again updated in the face of innovations. Based on the ideas of representatives of classical and non-classical philosophy and science, and of modern researchers, the authors take the definition of innovation beyond the scope of scientific and technical rationality, and thus its reduced interpretation is overcome. The conceptual theoretical conclusions of the anthropology of innovation, which is preoccupied with the future in the interests of the present, determine the special significance and responsibility of the sphere of education as a sphere of "cultivation of a human", in which a balance must be found between the values of change and the values of preservation.

DE social interaction; social exclusion; justice; excessive inequality;
   social order; narrative sociality
AB The article discusses the impact of social interactions on the formation of various social communities and, in general, on the formation of sociality. Depending on the "quality" of social interactions, their result can be either an increase in sociality or an increase in social alienation. To this end, it is shown that social interaction is a basic, cross-cutting concept in sociological knowledge. This situation is especially important today when the social world is being reformatted, network social organisms arise, hierarchical structures are inferior to the horizontal in the degree of their influence on social processes, and the internal needs of people in public consent change. Interacting with each other, people enter into the process of "socialization", which today is interpreted as sociality. Weakening social interaction breeds alienation. The article considers the interests of justice as unifying interests in Russian society; their violation causes social alienation. It is statistically proved that today the alienation of various individuals and groups, in connection with the violation of justice in society, becomes critical. Excess social inequality is considered as the main indicator of injustice. At the same time, attention is also paid to the "self-alienation" of the so-called "elite", and to the contrasts of incomes of various groups of the population. A positive social community, formed with respect for the interests of justice, with elimination of excessive differences in income, and having some common characteristics and its identity, is increasingly inferior to the so-called "narrative" one. "Narrative" sociality arises about some important events ("Crimea is ours!", FIFA World Cup, etc.), but it is unstable; it disintegrates as these events become distant in time. "Narrative" sociality coexists along with social alienation; it forms a certain social order in which a certain synthesis of the interests of economy, enterprise, justice and injustice arises. It is stated that it is necessary to turn to the heritage of Karl Marx when analyzing the contradictions of this social order. Today it is also highly relevant, especially when analyzing the various causes of social alienation and, in general, the main contradictions of society. It is suggested that, when forming a national and regional social policy, one should take into account the growing protest moods of the population and intensify the search for social "braces" capable of enhancing the interaction of people and integrating them into positive social communities.

ID CONVERSION
AB This article examines discussions of freedom of conscience and other religious liberties in the Orthodox ecclesiastical press between the Great Reforms of the 1860s and the first Russian Revolution in 1905. Avoiding highly influential and well-known religious thinkers, this piece instead focuses on forgotten ordained and lay writers who used their positions in the Church's hierarchy and educational establishments to reach a wide audience. At the heart of their views was a paradox: while frequently defining Christ as freedom and rejecting coercion in religious matters, these churchmen assailed freedom of conscience as morally dangerous and socially destructive. To explain this paradox and reveal why freedom of conscience allegedly posed such a threat, the article situates the writers in the institutional, intellectual, and political contexts of both the Church and the Russian Empire. Examining this is useful not only because it provides an example of how Russian Orthodox churchmen theologically justified the status quo of the empire's religious policy but also because it demonstrates how members of a state church perceived the shift of religion away from collective confessional ascription towards the individual, private sphere.

DE Sweden; riksdag; parliamentary coalition building; culturally different
   immigration; Sweden Democrats; deformation of the party-political
   system; parliamentary elections; formation of the government
AB The article examines results of the Swedish general election in September 2018, grave consequences of which have affected the ability of the Parliament to form a government and hereby to ensure continuity of exercising of the legislative and executive powers. The main outcome of the election was a relapse of a hung parliament with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats holding the balance of power, while neither the centre-left nor the centre-right bloc is willing to do a deal with them. Compared to the results of the previous election of 2014, in 2018, the situation was aggravated by strengthening of the Sweden Democrats' position in the riksdag and the establishment of equilibrium between the blocks that made it difficult to resolve the issue of a legitimate contender for the government formation. Although all the parties agree that the time of bloc politics has passed and cross-bloc cooperation is necessary, it has proved extremely complicated to implement this idea. Never before has process of forming the government been so time-consuming. The original cause of the complication is to be sought in sharp rise of culturally different immigration since the beginning of the 21st century. This is the rise that generated the electorate's demands for refusal to unrestricted immigration policy and for a party insisting on a serious restriction of the culturally different immigration. The Sweden Democrats have become such a party. Sweden will now contend with a fractured party-political landscape in which the center-right and center-left coalitions that have defined its politics for decades are deadlocked, and in the absence of the cross-bloc cooperation, the party-kingmaker is in a position to be a decisive force. All of this means that government crises and snap elections unknown to the country for many decades can become a usual thing. Thus, the Swedish election of 2018 has manifested that an accelerated multiculturalisation of a democratic society carries with itself acute political imbalances.

It is shown that the social state has historical roots and is subdivided into three types. Particular attention to this problem is traditionally given in France and in the studies of the French specialists. The ancient, long-existing, and new urgent problems of the social state are analysed. A hypothesis has been put forward that the current positions of a state-protector will be weakened by a change in socio-economic conditions and the political landscape in European countries.

The existing and potential trends are analyzed in the development of the system of international relations, which are associated with the continuing growth of financial and economic interdependence and the increasing competition between nations. The nations that are former and new leaders on the global arena play new roles and face contradictions in these processes. Special attention is paid to the processes related to the disintegration of the arms control system and the related deterioration of the global and regional military and political situation, especially in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The main sources of risks for the national security of Russia are identified in the context of these changes.

AB The concept "trading zones" (Peter Galison, Harry Collins) has become a peculiar pattern of a discussion on scientific communication during the past decade. The idea that scientific communication is not only fruitful but also problematic, and needs developing an interdisciplinary language and special mediative activities applies to the description of the situation in the sciences and in the relationship between the science and society as well. The role philosophy can play, the nature of scholarly communication, ways to apply the market metaphor of exchange and trade to its understanding - one should not discuss these issues in general terms only, but consider them in the context of the specific historical and sociological studies of science and technology. The article proposes a reconstruction of a fragment of the history of electrolysis, in which not only the physicist and chemist (Michael Faraday), but also the philosopher of science (W. Whewell) plays an unexpected role. It is the philosopher's ability to create a terminological innovation that turns out to be a sign of the trading zone formation, but trading here is to be understood as a special gift, and this contributes to the argument that knowledge cannot be bought, it can only be shared. The same case acts as the basis for the hypothesis about a philosopher's mediative role in science.

DT Article
DE dark ecology; hyperobjects; climate science; uncertainty; climate change
   denial; public space; differend; Timothy Morton; Francois Lyotard
AB One of the most discussed problems regarding climate science is that the knowledge it claims to have is plagued by uncertainty. Timothy Morton's dark ecology regards uncertainty as inextricable from any knowledge and also from any relation in general. This approach reveals that a rejection of uncertainty motivates both climate change deniers and their critics who would treat the conclusions of climate science as indisputable facts. Instead of treating uncertainty as a problem, dark ecology proposes that we learn how to live with it. But in order to do so, it recommends not only becoming attuned to the weird, "dark" side of things, but also tacitly suggests that the dark side is the only real one. Dark ecology is therefore bound to disregard those realms of human existence which are dependent upon transparency, such as public and political life.
   However, the article shows that particular processes in those realms have contributed significantly to the way the weird reality described by dark ecology became perceptible. Many of the features of global warming that dark ecology emphasizes-the impossibility of distancing oneself from it or of defining it completely and controlling it- become apparent only when a broad public controversy about its reality emerges and that controversy can never be resolved by citing allegedly certain facts The participants in such a controversy find that is impossible to convert the knowledge they have into a consensus. The article recommends taking that experience as a step toward attuning oneself to weird reality in which knowledge is more impotence than power.

AB What do ratings of political science journals show? What can they provide for us to understand problems of political science? How do the distinguishing features and common specifics of science development in Russia influence the ratings of political science journals? The authors answer the questions on the basis of analysing the Russian Science Citation Index ratings and some other bibliometric indicators of Russian journals which publish articles on politics. The article highlights difficulties of using the Science Index for integral assessment of publication activity and influence of scientific journals. Amongst them is the fuzzy thematic identification of journals in the system and the "discrepancy" of citation accounting in "latitude" and "quality". The authors analyses problems of impact-factors application for evaluations of scientific journals, science development, shaping and activity of scientific communities. The question of citation functions and meanings are examined. The authors compare political science journals ratings made on the basis of Science Index, expert evaluations and some bibliometric indicators calculated in RSCI system (for example half-life of articles) and reveal the importance of application of various indicators. The article discusses the necessity for amending the Science Index by including indicators which reflect "quality" in published articles and citation. The authors conclude that it is important to take into consideration the peculiarities of political science development in Russia when using journals ratings for their evaluation and assessment of situation in political science.

TI Measurement of Power by Steven Lukes
SO MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Review
DE politics; power; institutions; information; implosion; competition
AB In 2010, Steven Lukes' "Power: a Radical View" was first published in Russian. Although this monograph has long been a classic in international political discourse, its ideas are still largely unknown to Russian scholars. The current review briefly presents the core ideas of the book, but also considers several modern cases that can be fruitfully analyzed using Lukes' conceptual framework. To this end, the article reintroduces his conceptual framework with the purpose of better understanding how each of the three dimensions of power manifest themselves in terms of when competition is enacted within a political cycle. It is shown that the deeper the cut in power, the closer the competition towards the beginning of political cycle and the stronger the competition in external interactions. All three dimensions of power are illustrated using elections in USSR and Russia. Several additional cases are also reviewed, including, for instance, USA, North Korea, Vietnam and a handful of others, in order to illustrate other cases of political struggle in the international arena. The author also considers the sphere of culture, and, particularly, the intentional silencing of achievements of certain writers for ideological reasons, which is ultimately determined by the political confrontation between different social orders. An important conclusion from Lukes' conceptual framework is his thesis about the integrity and indivisibility of power, and ultimately the impossibility of its redistribution and sharing. The review also reflects on some of the consequences of the strengthening of power in the information society, which provides ample opportunities for manipulating public opinion. To this end, parallels are drawn between Lukes' three-dimensional concept of power, the implosion doctrine of Jean Baudrillard and the theory of attention deficit of Danilo Zolo. It shows that the mastery of the third (informational) dimension of power by ruling elites allows them to greatly extend their stay in power by dampening apparent discontent among the population and social conflicts.

   system-theoretical approach
AB The author analyzes the basic categories of social science that they are using for studying as of the dynamics of cultural identity as of the multicultural community by itself. The article is also devoted to study of the basic foundations of the civil identity of the Russia's society. The author uses the system-communicative paradigm that was widespread by N. Luhmann and applies to such categories as "freedom", "legitimacy", "recognition" in order to study the factors of reproduction of collective identity, representation and self-consciousness of the political nation. It is noted in the article that Russian society is facing the challenges of globalization so the traditional urban way of life is changing. Such a way of life used to keep national samples of culture, language, traditions and values and played the role of the "mediator" of the intercultural communication and set the boundaries of the intercultural interaction. The on-going intensification of intercultural interaction often leads to the actualization of the political projects, that declare the ideas and goals of the support and protection of the particular ethnocultural groups. Which in turn could serve as a catalyst for centrifugal tendencies, generating threats to the state's security and integrity.

AB In the 1860s the Russian Empire continued its expansion into Central Asia. New territories in 1867 were integrated into the Turkestan Governor-Generalship, and its governor received large powers. The liberal policy of General K.P. von Kaufman contributed to the beginning of the modernization of the social, political and economic life of the region. Thanks to his civic stance, the emancipation of the Bukhara Jews began, which for centuries were disqualified from civil and economic rights by the Muslim majority. In the 1870s - 1880s the protective policy of the Russian authorities also distinguished them among the other Jewish population of the Russian Empire, allowing them to engage exclusively in distillation and wine trade in Turkestan. Trade in Russian manufactory goods and wine allowed the Bukhara Jews to go through a stage of original accumulation of capital in a short time. The liquidation of the wine monopoly at the turn of the 1880s - 1890s forced them to reorient themselves and direct the accumulated capital to new areas, contributing to the modernization of the region.
   This article deals with the problem of the interdependence of the civil status of Bukhara Jews and the spheres of economic activity available to them. The article is written on the basis of archive and published documents of the second half of the XIX century and beginning of the XX century.

ID TURKEY
AB Relations between the United States and Turkey, the two military-political allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), are experiencing an unprecedented crisis in their history. Its depth and scale is so significant that it affects the long-term foreign policy strategies of both countries, as well as the process of building a unified security architecture. In the study the author raises a question to what extent the current crisis in the US-Turkish relations is systemic? How high is the probability that it will turn out to be a long-term one? To answer this question, the study is divided into two parts.
   The first part analyzes the evolution of American approaches to Turkey in US foreign policy, the implementation of these approaches since the end of World War II till nowadays. On the basis of a system-historical approach, the author analyses the evolution the Turkey's strategic positioning in the US foreign policy strategy and the transformation of political, economic and military relations between the two states since the moment of their institutionalization. The author distinguishes two stages of this evolution. During the first one, for the United States Turkey was one of the key countries that was blocking the Soviet expansion southward towards the Persian Gulf and the Suez Canal. The author notes that by the end of the bipolar confrontation, Turkey was de-facto losing its functional purpose in the logic of the Cold War. During the second stage, the US regards Turkey as one of the key NATO allies, whose geo-strategic location can be used for pursuing American national interests in the nearby regions. Author posits, that bilateral relations are gradually moving away from such a model of interaction. This happens because of the Turkish desire to diversify foreign relations and accumulation of contradictions between Washington and Ankara due to the divergence of their foreign policy strategies.
   The second part analyzes the contradictions in the American-Turkish relations under the presidency of Donald Trump on political, military and economic issues. The author comes to the conclusion that the crisis is indeed a systemic one. Firstly, the existing problems began to affect significant elements of the military-technical infrastructure of their relations. Secondly, it is difficult to resolve these problems without reformatting the interaction as between equivalent actors of international relations. Thirdly, the expert and political communities have not presented any kind of a new approach to rethink the allied status of American-Turkish relations.

TI ANARCHO-LOCALISM AND CRISIS OF LEFT POLITICAL THOUGHT
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Marxism; anarchism; localism; centralism; communism; socialism;
   post-capitalism; basic income
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of two opposing tendencies in the left-wing political thought. The first one is left-wing centralism, which is understood as a concept (common among many left-wing concepts) that emphasizes the priority role of the centralized coordinating organizations (parties, states, world associations, etc.) in the political struggle and/or building post-capitalist social relations. The second one is anarcho-localism that focuses on network self-organization and decentralization. Having documented the gradual ousting of left-wing centralism by anarcho-localism, the author identifies the complex of objective and subjective factors that stimulated the process. According to the author, the growth of anarcho-localist tendencies within the left-wing political thought was associated with the rethinking of the teaching of Karl Marx after the publication of his previously unpublished works, disenchantment with the Soviet-style bureaucratic socialism, recognition of environmental problems caused by the large-scale mass production, and the rise of the counterculture. However, in his opinion, a key role in pushing centralism to the periphery of the left-wing political thought played the emergence and the development of new communication technologies that opened the way for the transition to network social interactions.
   The author interprets the predominance of anarcho-localist ideas in the left political thought as the evidence of its deep crisis. In support of his argument he refers both to the unsuccessful practical experience of social movements inspired by these ideas, which demonstrated their weakness in the face of the global bourgeois system, and to the fundamental inability of anarcho-localism to work out a convincing, preferable and, most importantly, realistic image of the future that reflects the complexity of the world socio-economic and political interactions. He predicts an increase in the demand for the centralist leftist concepts as the society develops further.

ID FINNISH; COOPERATION; TOURISM; POLAND; EGTC
AB This article analyzes and compares EU and Russian approaches to the study of cross-border cooperation (CBC) after the Cold War, after examining the historical background and main theoretical approaches that have framed this literature. While EU literature has mirrored EU practice by drawing attention to more diverse and complex modes of cooperation, Russian analyses echo the official emphasis on mutual economic interactions with EU countries at the border areas. Western analyses of CBC are implicitly influenced by the works on new regionalism' and transnationalism. As a whole, the European scholars underline that cross-border projects have had limited impact; they point to various obstacles to cross-border economic development, resulting in only a limited effect on existing structural factors. In turn, Russian scholars acknowledge the minor interest of the Russian government in cross-border cooperation with the EU, stressing Russia's priority to implement an independent foreign policy in Europe aimed at restoration of its own economic power. Operating from a constructivist theoretical framework, the authors conclude that the ideational apparatus used to analyze border cooperation is strongly conditioned by the political context in which scholars operate as well as by the larger geopolitical situation.

TI Stalin modernization as a historical experience

LA Russian
DT Article
DE modernization; Stalinism; revolution from above; industrialization; USSR
AB In this article we consider the third attempt of modernizing Russia, or Stalin modernization. Along with previous attempts, Stalin modernization had the character of a "revolution from above". As it defined the creation of a society of socialism, the critical evaluation of the historical experience of Stalin modernization, including all its negative and positive aspects, is very important for modern studies of man and society. In the end, the existing evaluations of Stalin modernization depend on the relationship to the Soviet experience of creating a socialist society in the USSR. The first characteristic feature of Stalin modernization is the fact that, along with previous modernization attempts, it was "overtaking modernization". The fact that all attempts of modernization in Russia were kinds of "revolution from above" predetermined the inverse sequence of transformations: initiatives of the ruling class were not the answer to the needs of civil society; on the contrary, these initiatives were directed towards regulating the development of civil society and its requirements. Marxist rhetoric, which served as ideological support for Stalin modernization, should not mislead when Stalin transformations are presented as unique, not having analogs in the history. Stalin modernization was strongly connected with preparation for war, and if this preparation concealed the ultimate goals of transformation ("creation of socialism in a separately taken country" in Marxist terminology), then at that time it was quite justified, as there was a possibility of the disappearance of both the subject and object of modernization. Incomplete Stalin modernization led to the death of the political system which it had also created, and to the death of the state which was given rise to by the requirements of modernization.

AB The article consists of two parts. In the first one the authors dismiss the settled narrative that the EU and EU member states are mired in series of crises, and are not able to overcome them and as a result become internally weaker and lose their positions in the international arena. They explain that the acute phase of the crises is left behind. Numerous facts and examples from the EU practice are provided. But the EU has poorly calculated social costs of its decisions. The balance in society has been lost. In order to keep power traditional political elites have to share it with populists, nationalists, extreme-right and former eurosceptics and rebuild themselves. But no matter how the internal political situation will evolve in particular countries, the further development of the EU becomes more and more definite. Over the past few years, integration has become faster. Member states have no choice but to seek to strengthen the EU, increase its efficiency and ability to withstand new challenges. Accordingly it is very important to understand what kind of legal instruments to achieve such aims they have in their possession. Comprehensive answer to these questions is given in the second part of the article.

ID INTEGRATION
AB Development of the global knowledge-driven economy requires the intensification of scientific, technical and educational cooperation in order to ensure competitiveness, technology transfer and improve the quality of life of the people. This task is particularly relevant in integration associations: over the past 20 years the European Union has proved the effectiveness of scientific, industrial and educational cooperation in the interests of economic integration. The Eurasian economic Union is only at the beginning of this promising path and faces a number of difficulties.
   The purpose of the article is to analyze the state and prospects of cooperation of the EAEU member States in the field of science and higher education. The main thesis of the author is that the launch of the process of the common Eurasian educational space will increase the effectiveness of achieving the goals of the Union Treaty, improving the quality and quantity of economic growth. The pilot projects of the Eurasian technology platforms, especially in the space field, not only serve as examples of successful interaction of mixed research teams, but also give a political signal of the readiness of countries to coordinate their national interests with long-term integration plans. Cooperation in the field of higher education lays the Foundation for a single market of qualified labor resources, contributes to the formation of the personnel potential of the Association, the development of relations between the youth of the "Eurasian five", the interpenetration of common values and ideas.
   Political and financial support for Russia gives an important impetus to the development of scientific and educational cooperation in the EAEU. However, many projects are hold up due to the lack of popularization of the ideology of Eurasianism and nationalist rhetoric rooted in the partner countries of Russia. The solution of these problems is in the adoption of joint measures to strengthen ties in the triangle "comprehensive information support of the Eurasian idea - scientific and educational cooperation - loyalty of the people to the integration project" If we extrapolate the neo-functional principle of "spillover" to the scientific and educational component of the integration processes, then with the effective implementation of such measures, if successful, this strategy will lead to the formation of a public demand for deepening integration cooperation, including the field of science and education, which, in turn, will bring benefits of economic integration and strengthen the international competitiveness of the EAEU.

AB The article is devoted to the supernatural punishment hypothesis elaborated by Dominic D.P.Johnson, Professor at the Oxford University, and a possibility of applying this hypothesis to Political Science. The essence of the hypothesis is that religion and belief in gods improve human cooperation and form a basis for altruistic behavior. Johnson views people's ability to believe in the "supernatural agent" who is watching them and who will surely punish them for their sins as the evolutionary meaning of religion. The author provides a detailed analysis of Johnson's concept and demonstrates its unequivocal scientific importance, but at the same time he pinpoints its weaknesses such as data interpretation and adequacy of using the terms "religion", "altruism" and "group cooperation".
   The author proposes several alternative explanations of the evolutionary meaning of religion and considers it from the meme theory perspective. According to his conclusion, if altruistic behavior is indeed natural to human beings at the biological level, then an institution of religion can be viewed as its higher form, but not its cause. In order to make both positions in this scientific debate clear, the author invites metaphors of symbiosis and parasitism for describing relationships between a human being and a belief in a supernatural agent (religion). Johnson's hypothesis deserves close attention and scrutiny as an argument in favor of the "symbiosis" metaphor. However, one must use it with caution, admit its limitations and avoid oversimplification of a highly complicated model of the human sociality that inevitably includes religious consciousness.

AB Our paper focuses on the main directions of human economic development. We consider such questions as interrelation of the theory and concept of the human capital, concept of human development, its influence on economy, etc. It is noted that the economic growth and growth of a standard of living is possible only in those countries where the government protects interests of the citizens, makes and puts into practice social programs, carries out reforms in education and health care. New and extensive employment has been created in connection with the collection and analysis of information in the field of electronic technology, telecommunications, political, social and economic life. In other words, human capital has become a key factor in the development of information technologies and cannot imagine the modern information economy without them. Formation of personnel training system for the use of information technologies in all spheres has become a serious problem. Transition to the information economy requires the creation of a broad mass of the population to use information and telecommunication technologies, including high-speed Internet resources.

TI The Polish Question Through the Eyes of Russian Liberal
   Constitutionalists on the Eve and During the January Uprising
SO VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA
LA English
DT Article
DE Poland; liberalism; P.V. Dolgorukov; maximalism; independence
AB The article examines ideological positions of Russian liberal constitutionalists with regard to the Polish question in the 1860s. The author comes to the conclusion that mutual misunderstanding between Russian and Polish political writers stemmed from different perceptions of the Polish issue. While the Polish side supposed that it was necessary to restore "historic Poland" within the boundaries of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth before its first partition in 1772, Russian liberals and radicals, to a certain extent, were ready to consider only the autonomy or independence of "ethnographic Poland" conceding the possibility of national referendum about the state affiliation of the disputed territories. The events in Russia and Poland determined changes in the views on acute problems of the Russian-Polish co-existence. The author exemplifies this statement by the evolution in political positions on the Polish question of a famous Russian emigre and constitutionalist P. V. Dolgorukov. When he edited the journal "Budushchnost" ("Future") in 1860-1861, he advocated autonomy of "ethnographic Poland", at the end of 1862 - the middle of 1863 he joined the supporters of independent "ethnographic Poland" and referendum on the state affiliation of contemporary Lithuania, Belorussia and Right-Bank Ukraine, and after the suppression of the Polish rebellion in 1863-1864, the emigre turned to his previous position. By this time, it had become evident that despite the disagreement between "the White" and "the Red" in the Polish national movement, politically active Poles were united in their understanding of one issue - "the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from the sea to the sea". However, this view was inadmissible for the Russian liberals and even revolutionaries, let alone conservatives. This maximalism delayed the return of Poland to the European political map not only as an independent state but also as a political autonomy modelled on Finland of the 19th century.

AB The review, consisting of three thematic blocks, presents an interpretation of the main trends in the evolution of modern scientific and philosophical discussions on general problems in education and educational policy that have continued, with unabated intensity, for the past two decades in Western analytical literature. Priority is given to the analysis of modern theories of education and their interrelations with ancient tradition, which still affects modern concepts of democracy and citizenship. The author also explores the various, sometimes diametrically opposed approaches of scientists to the analysis of the phenomenon of globalization and the causes of the crisis of traditional democratic institutions and educational systems. The review also presents critical assessments of the value of diverse studies, in which scholars strive to revive and reinterpret, both the classical philosophy of education of the 18-19th centuries and the heritage of the great education theorists of the 201th century.

AB This study analyzes the discussion of import substitution in the Russian press from August 2014 to December 2016. By drawing on 269 press media items (obtained from the "Integrum" database and featuring Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Novaya Gazeta, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Kommersant) the authors show that the discussion is being constructed within the following eight frames - anti-Western, patriotic, nostalgic, sentimental, interest-centered, consequence-centered, selfish and demonstrative. The most popular frames are the patriotic and the consequence-centered ones. However, the spectrum of frames most frequently engaged differs across periodicals. For instance, while the pro-state and pro-government Rossiyskaya Gazeta constructs a predominantly positive image of import substitution through the use of anti-Western and patriotic frames, the more liberal and oppositional Novaya Gazeta often emphasizes the likely negative consequences of such protectionism using the sentimental and demonstrative frames. Komsomolskaya Pravda uses the widest range of frames, but presents the information in a more simplified form to make it clearer to its target audience. In contrast, Kommersant discusses import substitution at a more expert level and invokes the selfish and the consequence-centered frames. Through the qualitative content-analysis of the selected media the authors have produced a list of keywords that serve to determine the place of import substitution in network agenda-setting. Their joint reference analysis has revealed three large clusters in the public discussion: the economic-political, the selfishly patriotic and the protectionist cluster. The authors conclude that the debate on import substitution combines both economic and political arguments; and the media often resort to ideological constructs to justify their attitude towards import substitution.

DT Article
DE Crimea; Napoleon; espionage; travelogues; Napoleonic wars; Russian

AB Among the components of Napoleon's foreign policy there was an attempt to revive France's former influence in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea. This paper addresses the efforts paid by the emperor and his retinue to collect information on the Crimea and their plans to use this peninsula for the needs of foreign political game. In 1802, Napoleon initiated the treaty with Russia on the Black Sea trade. In 1803, French diplomatist Jean Reuilly visited the Crimea, made a detailed account of it, and suggested to use the peninsula as an outpost for commercial penetration into the inner provinces of Russia and farther to Central Asia. It has been proved that Napoleon changed his "Crimean projects" according to current political situation. In February 1807, trying to establish alliance with the Ottoman Porte, he suggested the Turks his help to win the Crimea back, but in a few years later Napoleon offered Alexander I of Russia the partition of the Porte. On the eve of the invasion into Russia, the retinue of Napoleon discussed the project of making a barrier of restored and French-dependent states on Russian border. One of them should be a Crimean Tartar realm allied to France in its struggle with the Russian Empire. The Russian government's policy towards the Crimean Tatars during the armed conflicts in 1806-1814 was someway twofold since it did not trust this group of subjects, but the Crimean Tartars kept loyal to Russia, and some of them gain laurels in the Napoleonic wars.

The relevance of the study carried out involves on the basis of theoretical data the necessity to create practice-oriented recommendations aimed at development of social and political activity of youth, taking into account the social demand An empirical study involved 150 people (at the age of 18 to 27 y. o.). The social and psychological study devoted to the study of social and psychological characteristics of social and political activity, helped to establish a number of features that make up the psychological content of this phenomenon. In that way, social and political activity is heavily tied to civic and protest activity, which is confirmed by the obtained correlation relationships. The factor analysis carried out revealed 3 main factors, differentiated by the presence or absence of a load in relation to social and political activity, which we called: "Citizens", "Oppositionists", "Indifferents", that reflect the psychological content of social activity.

AB This article analyses the educational trajectories of members of regional elites in contemporary Russia to determine the specifics of education and its role in the process of elite reproduction. It is based on an empirical study of 635 structured biographies of the political and administrative elite of St. Petersburg, Leningradskaya, Rostovskaya, Kaliningradskaya, Kostromskaya, Khabarovskii regions conducted 2011-2016. The findings reveal a gradual movement away from the "technocratic" educational profile of regional elites towards graduates with economic and juristic profiles. Members of the elite often possess several higher education qualifications and/or an doctorate. The study also reveals regional variation in the share of securocrats: in particular, the incidence of military education increases with rank in the power vertical. Importantly, the study casts doubts on the existence of a pool of elite universities involved in elite reproduction. The findings have important implications for regional analysis and the policies of elite recruitment in regions.

ID NEUROSCIENCE
AB Neuroeconomics is often seen as the result of neuroscience expansion into economics. However, economics itself has a substantial background of epistemic intervention by spreading rational choice modelling over sociology, political science and part of biology. Neuroeconomics contributes considerably to the economic imperialism progress by developing an important tendency. We would describe it as deeper universalization of economic (rational) behavior by its naturalization and transmuting it in completely biochemical phenomenon. The paper reviews the Paul Glimcher's project of neuroeconomics as a specific version of economic imperialism claiming that the brain can be modeled using the principles of standard economic theory. Considering neuroeconomics as a methodological approach, the authors show that behind the ideas of reducibility of key economics' concepts such as "choice" or "utility" to neuroscience data and of "direct transferring" the concepts from economics into neuroscience lies the intention to reinterpret and rewrite neuroscience and other life sciences in terms of economics. It could be done if one would demonstrate the identity of brain and logical or computer structure and if the mathematical models taken from economics would hold the economic semantics while applying to the brain activity. Turning "choice" and its "economic relatives" into the key concepts for interpreting the neural structures and their activity would open the way for neuroeconomics to become an imperial science on human, life or even nature itself.

AB The digitalization of the economy opens up new opportunities for business and the development of interstate investment cooperation, which is caused by the objective strengthening of globalization processes at all levels. The impact of digital technologies on all sectors of the economy is constantly growing. Digital technologies have become the main drivers for financial market transformation, FDI flows development and created new challenges for the next few years. German-Russian investment relations are closely linked to political and digital transformation which requires developing and introducing new solutions that enable interaction among market participants, so the analysis of investment relations between Russia and Germany in the context of digital transformation is relevant for the study. German FDI in Russia and Russian FDI in Germany are presented in the article. Geographical distribution of Russian and German investments are studied. Sustainability of Russian direct investment in Germany is discussed. Industries of investments in the context of digital transformation are defined. Particular attention has been paid to the problems in the field of investment, which have hampered mutually beneficial cooperation between these countries. The prospects for the development of Russian-German relations and the efforts of the Russian side to revive an effective economic policy are considered.

AB The breakdown of Austria-Hungary led to significant changes in political, economic and cultural life of Central-Eastern Europe in the 1920-1950s. Inhabitants of the region faced the growth of nationalism, authoritarianism and decline in living standards. The authors analyze the influence of these processes on birth and development of the Habsburg myth in its various forms. The "Golden Age" was associated with the rule of Emperor Franz-Joseph I and Empress Elizabeth of Austria (of Bavaria) by many inhabitants of the region. The Emperor was a symbol of stability, centrality and humanity, while the Empress reflected aristocratism, romanticism and aspiration to the beauty. The authors have noted that the inhabitants of Central-Eastern Europe did not find these qualities in modem society turning to the history of Austria-Hungary. The gradual depoliticization of the Habsburg myth in the second half of the 20th c., its erosion in a daily life is shown in the article; it is mostly turning into a social product of mass consumption first of all in spheres of tourism and popular culture.

AB The article looks at the political problems which are the focus of the "Macron's Elections, or the Choice of France: French Politics in 2017-2018", the last book of eminent political technologist Igor Bunin, published last year. The decreasing influence of both traditional political parties - Socialists and Republicans - is caused by the fact that both of them, being in power, failed to find solutions to the growing socio-economic problems of the country. Their approach to the elections provoked internal disagreement on many issues of public life. Against this backdrop, extreme political movements, both right and left, grew stronger politically, standing on platforms of populism. This urgent need for new politics was skillfully utilized by Macron, who won the presidential elections, alongside his speedily-created new party "Forward, France!" which achieved an absolute majority in the National Assembly. In the course of an unusual election campaign, the discussion about the country's future appeared to be largely diluted. According to the results of the election cycle of 2017, the two-party political system that had been in force for the last half-century has been blown up, and the political elite of the country has been radically renewed. The first steps of the administration of Macron, vigorously embarking on reforming the socio-economic model of the country, as well as the origins of the large-scale social crisis in France at the turn of 2018-2019, are shown; the deep roots of this is the cause of the erosion of the middle class and the growing volatility of its position, which actively tightens populism.

AB The author of article addresses the emergence problem which is scarcely studied in historical science in cross-cultural communication of the British and Russians of such phenomenon as xenophobia. Within the innovative direction of an imagologiya the reasons of russophobia of British (ignorance by them of language, history of the Russian state and also customs of its inhabitants) which led to incorrect formation of ethnic images of the Russian people and state's system of the country are analyzed. The main stages in development of russophobia in England throughout the 16th - 18th centuries are traced. The author comes to conclusion: in Great Britain the russophobia artificially was modelled and went the political elite creating from Russia an image of the enemy for the only purpose - to achieve elimination of the economic and political competitor in Europe.

ID FUTURE
AB The article examines the theoretical and methodological foundations of forecasting the transformation of the modern political world order, and analyzes alternative scenarios of overcoming the modern crisis of global controllability. Particular attention is paid to identifying latent opportunities for evolutionary self-transformation of the modern world and the conditions for their actualization and activation. Among the priorities of the author's analysis are the nature of the modern state and the evolutionary changes that its basic national-territorial model has undergone over the past century, and at the same time, the features of new systemic practices of modern state building that go beyond the previously universally recognized regulatory institutional framework. The essence of the modern crisis, according to the author, is reduced to overcoming the unipolar dysfunction that arose as a result of the collapse of the bipolar system and, paradoxically, became the crown of development of a pluralistic international system of democratic nation-states. A striking manifestation of this dysfunction is, on the one hand, the growing discrepancy between the capabilities of the national-territorial model of statehood and the development needs of the communities of the modern world, and on the other, the insurmountable problem of translating global leadership: this problem diagnoses the fundamental inadequacy of the hierarchical principle of world order in relation to today's global governance tasks. The ineffectiveness of previously practiced techniques and the lack of new effective development strategies, acceptable to all the main subjects of world politics, forms the situation of global interlude, expectations and delayed action for the foreseeable future.

   studies; Slavophilism; historisophy
AB The main focus of the article is a detailed reconstruction of the reception of State Secrets of Venice, the main historiosophical work by V. Lamansky.The article also provides comments on State Secrets received from Russian and foreign researchers. On the basis of the review written by A. Budilovich, the article gives a detailed exposition of Lamansky's work. It is shown that although Lamansky's work is formally aimed at the reconstruction of the history of political assassination in Venice in the XV-XVIII centuries, it emphasizes the new elucidation of the Eastern Question as reduced to the problem of Russian and European relations. The facts given in the work are only valuable as a means of the illustration of the idea of the profound controversy between the Romano-Germanic and Greek-Slavic worlds. On this point, the authors demonstrated the continuity between the historisophy of the early Slavophiles (firstly A. Khomiakov) and Lamansky's historical methodology. It is shown that both early- and later-Slavophiles considered the historical problematics as based on the actual cultural situation. The article proves that Lamansky's State Secrets of Venice is rather of the political type; it strives to give a moral conviction of European politics, that is, to show Europe in its own true image. In this regard, the authors consider State Secrets of Venice as a work which more fully expresses the later-Slavophile conception of Europe. The article also shows Lamansky's relation to pan-slavism. It is noted that Lamansky regarded Austro-slavism negatively; he understood it as an attempt to drive Slays apart and to turn them against Russia, which, in his opinion, is the only true defender of Slavic interests.

AB Analysis of the political aspects of the development of Internet social networks is a promising field in political sociology. The cyberspace of the network performs not only a social and communicative function, but also possesses significant political potential. Online social networks have become a phenomenon of social and political life in modern Russia and influence its dynamics and character, acting as a legitimising power mechanism. Integration of public policy into virtual social space causes formation of network forms of political participation for citizens and their new online identities. At the same time, the specifics of online political interactions limit the opportunities for social dialogue, which is already difficult in Russia due to the existence of clearly expressed ideological and value differences in society. The social Internet space serves as a virtual projection of social contradictions and acts as an arena for the clash of political interests. Social networks, although declaring the principles of solidarity, self-organization and collective identity, are in fact stratified, do not imply equality of users, nor do they provide a balance of their interests. Networks provide a wide range of opportunities for political manipulation and influence curation of public consciousness. In Russia, political power uses a number of tools to implement administrative control over the digital social space, which makes one question viability of the network society project as a modern policy-management alternative. Nevertheless, it is hoped that as the network involvement of Russian citizens increases, the political potential of the virtual communication space will increase, too.

AB The question of changings in a woman's role in Dagestan after the Great October revolution is considered. It is noted that in the new society gender equality was one of the key problems, the attitude to which in the territory of Dagestan has not lost its relevance for a long time after the establishment of Soviet power. It is shown that women's participation in the socio-political life of the region was a topical issue due to a variety of objective and subjective factors, among which the factor of domination of the Islamic religious worldview in all social spheres of Dagestan society stood out, taking into account the fact that the power of its influence in the first post-revolutionary years was not lost. With the help of archival materials, the author examines the gender policy pursued by the Soviet government, in particular, the training of Dagestan women in literacy, their involvement in socio-economic and political activities, etc. It is indicated that the policy of increasing the social status of Dagestan women met with misunderstanding and rejection in society up to the use of violence against socially active women. The author concludes that due to the purposeful policy of the Soviet power by the end of 1930s it was possible to achieve significant results in the nomination of women in various structures of power.

The article implements the theoretical and historical approach in macro-sociology. including shuttle movements between the General hypotheses and the systematic comparison of cases for their verification and correction. In the "Spring of Nations" as a vast wave of European revolutions of 1848-1849 the imperial center (Vienna) and ethnic provinces of the Austrian Empire (Venice-Lombardy, Hungary and the Czech Republic) were taken for analysis. The factors of creating a revolutionary situation are clarified and the hypothesis of "filling" the missing factors due to the external influence of revolutions in neighboring and/or highly preferred societies - due to the effect of the revolutionary wave is confirmed.

ID POWER
AB Lebanon has a number of features that determine its special position in the region and its importance in the system of relations between the Middle East states. An important role in this is played by the ideological and strategic aspects of world politics in the region in which Lebanon is organically inscribed in both the historical and geopolitical plans. The stability of a country that has passed through a long civil war makes it stand out from a number of states in the region. The author's hypothesis is that the reason for the extraordinary stability - of Lebanese society, the system of state power, political elites, economic ties and foreign policy contacts, despite all the negative regional factors - can be rooted in the consociational principle of making key decisions based, paradoxically, on the notorious political confessionalism. The peculiarities of the Lebanese political model (although they are subject to well-deserved criticism) distinguish it from the multitude of "customary" democracies, bringing together with examples of the unique democratic systems of Europe and other continents. The motley confessional composition of society, along with the historically determined foreign policy guidelines of individual communities, suggested a special informal decision-making mechanism throughout the country - not on the basis of majority power, but on a contractual, compromise principle. Leading theorists of consociationalism often had in mind the Lebanese pattern of democracy in their political studies, and many of their developments are still well applicable for analyzing the functioning of the main state institutions of Lebanon. A theoretical study, along with an analysis of the current regional situation, convince the author of the correctness of the hypothesis put forward. Both in Lebanese history and now, it is the inveterate forms of external influences that forced Lebanese society to balance on the verge of aggravated intercommunal clashes. The combination of external factors served as the beginning and further warmed up the civil war. Heightened relations with Syria by 2005, the Israeli attack in 2006, the gravest threat from jihadi-caliphatists - all these factors have negatively affected intra-civil and inter-group relations. Stereotypical forms of use of religious communities (Shiites, Sunnis, Christians of different denominations, etc.) from the outside and even direct pressure from abroad continue to confront them, imposing ideas on social relations and political participation that are alien to Lebanese. Diversification of political and business contacts of Russia with representatives of different Lebanese communities can serve as a good example of Lebanon's perception of all the features of its political system as a full subject of international relations.

DT Article
DE historical memory; ethnopolitical conflict; ethno-confessional
   relations; collective consciousness; ethnic identity
AB The article shows historical memory as one of the key issues in the interdisciplinary field of social research since it determines socio-cultural and political aspects of the life of social groups. It forms the traditions and defines values necessary for the society development, accomplishes integrative function for the nation, ethnic group, accumulates experience of generations and enriches historical consciousness. However, the other side of historical memory as a significant factor of ethnic and religious conflicts is also highlighted. Firstly, historical memory has a conflict potential connected with identity of the social community (ethnic, religious, national) since self-perception of "we" always includes opposition to others, strangers, usually hostile communities. Secondly, historical memory could also mobilize for struggle. The traumatic aspects of collective memory are successfully used in ethno-confessional conflicts for political manipulation and tension escalation It is a time-consuming task to build new relationships, to shift hostility to a neutral phase and then to the stage of cooperation, equality and integration. Contradictory nature of historical memory requires a systematic approach to peace-making policy, to changes in views, to repressing aspects of ethnic and religious conflicts from historical memory. The article presents the results of sociological research aimed at studying different aspects of the historical memory of the Russian society and several post-Soviet countries. The study highlights the dual role of historical memory - ethno integration and division. The authors analyze the personified memory of ethno-confessional conflicts and its reflection in modernity resulting in the information wars, propaganda of enmity and mythologems about the heroes and victims of the lost past.

AB This article is an attempt at sociocultural and sociolinguistic studies of texts of the poetic generation of Perestroika, i.e. poets whose "mentality" and "writing style" were formed in the 1970s, and whose active participation in the literary process began in the 1980s. The purpose of the study is to identify the main features of the paradigm of Perestroika (common sociocultural emotions, the system of values, the "passwords" of the epoch, the set of keywords and "things", the general type of semiotic relations and "paradigm-forming" language), reflected in the work of the generation represented by meta-realists I. Zhdanov, A. Parshchikov, A. Eremenko, V. Aristov, A. Dragomoshchenko, etc.). conceptualists (D. A. Prigov, L. Rubinstein, T. Kibirov), and ironists (V. Druk, N. Iskrenko, Y. Arabov). In the study of poetic texts, the author employs corpus and linguocultural comparative analysis methods, determining the key words and concepts of the epoch of Perestroika by means of continuous sampling from specialised dictionaries. Additionally, they are singled out using the method of discourse analysis in political journalism texts. In the poetry of the 1980s-2000s, the author manages to identify reflexes of the concept of "stagnation" in the use of tautologies, and of the "bilingualism" of the Soviet time in the oppositions between "simple" and "complex", "literal" and "poetic", "superficial" and "deep", "Hell" and "Paradise", which is associated with the concept of "personal space" in the context of "unbundling" and "humanisation" characteristic of the restructuring. The article also discusses the parallels of the concept of open world, cooperation and co-creation, "glasnost" and democracy with the principles of building a poetic world and relations with the reader. As a result, the author concludes that the poetry of the 1980s-2000s is naturally incorporated into the sociocultural and linguistic paradigm of Perestroika.

DT Article
DE success; methodology; society; sociological survey; needs; sustainable
   development
AB The article discusses theoretical foundations of understanding success, substantiates methodological approaches to studying the successfulness of the 20th century individual, and discusses findings of an exploratory research conducted by an international team of scientists. We consider it important to study the social phenomenon such as "succesfulness of a modern individual" in the context of their satisfaction with important aspects of life and work and from the perspective of a wide range of socio-cultural, socio-psychological and demographic determinants. The study uses methods developed in various fields of social and humanitarian science; the methods describe the phenomenon' of success in a meaningful way and identify its prevalence and manifestation features in different countries (in this project - Russia, Poland and Belarus) and in specific groups within countries. An exploratory research performed in this way has an interdisciplinary basis and relies on the synthesis of econometric (modeling, correlation and regression analysis), sociological (questionnaire survey), and psychological (testing) methods. The article presents findings of a pilot sociological survey and psychological testing of the population of different cities of Russia (Vologda, Cherepovets, Petrozavodsk, Kolomna), Belarus (Minsk) and Poland (Lublin). The pilot stage of the comparative cross-country study involved empirical testing of the selected tools in determining success factors in different linguistic, cultural and political environments, searching for methodological approaches to the essence of the phenomenon under consideration, and the operationalization of the concepts used. Successfulness' has been studied in terms of self-esteem and in relation to life satisfaction. The study covered main spheres and conditions of human life. We tested relevant hypotheses that we had confirmed in the course of regional studies. The scientific significance and novelty of the research lies in the exploratory nature of the project, an attempt to solve a scientific problem by integrating knowledge and methods from various scientific fields. The findings of the study, its conclusions and models can become the basis for the development of a full-fledged concept of "modern successful individual".

TI 'So where are your in-laws from?': Realities and mental images within

SO NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Kalmyks; Kalmykia; wedding; wedding rites; in-laws; space; ethnic groups
AB The article examines the ideas of explored space in its relation to differences between wedding rites inherent to diverse subethnic groups of the today Kalmyks. Ethnic and administrative divisions of the Kalmyks have always been closely linked. The term 'ulus' denoted both a territorial unit and its ethnically bound population. The space assigned to a certain ulus was constituted by a number of consecutive circles, with the focus in the place of residence of an individual and the community of their kinsfolk. This cultivated area was perceived as one's 'own land', their 'ancestral territory'. By the early 21st century, Kalmyks have developed a form of perceiving one's 'own' space through the prism of ulus division as imposed on present-day boundaries within the republic. This still serves as a foundation stone of 'belonging' to a certain sub-ethnic group 'determined' geographically.
   Such a perception of space among modern Kalmyks - both rural and urban dwellers - is taken into consideration during wedding rites. It stems from the four-part horizontal division of space whereby cardinal points are tied to residential areas of certain sub-ethnic groups. The future wedding and a journey to the potential in-laws, differences in wedding rites, as well as the to-be-delivered food sets and utensils are tied to the concept of 'otherness', 'alienness', to a temporal shift into a similar but 'alien' space marked by the Kalmyk term 'khar gamma azr' (Kalm. (sic)). The idea of crossing into and staying in an 'alien land' gave rise to compulsory ceremonial offerings to master spirits of the land and ancestors at borders of essential circles connected to the vertical three-part division of space. Reaching the center of an 'alien land' and stay in a dwelling has preserved the spatial semantic code of traditional culture. In the ritual landscape the parties must reach a compromise to comply with one's 'own laws'.
   For its sources, the article relies on the materials on wedding rites collected by the author during fieldwork in Kalmykia in 2008-2010 and 2018-2019.

DT Article
DE mass dance (plyaska); physical culture dance; mass dance instructor; the
   Soviet self-made art; foxtrot
AB In his book on the history of creating "self-made art" in the USSR, Igor Narskiy describes a paradox: "selfmade" art managed from the top, creativity under instruction, controlled independent art. In the article, the author discusses how, in the mid-1920s, the Soviet state attempted to introduce control over what traditionally was understood as the most direct, spontaneous and free, the "Dionysian", kind of dance (in Russian, plyaska). In some respect, free dance yielded to pressure, although it resisted in other aspects. The author examines the 1920s as the period preceding the frames of Igor Narskiy's research. In the period, the political control over art was not yet total, and it produced some very grotesque institutional forms like the governmental department of mass plyaska. This directly af- fected the so-called salon or social dances, including tango and foxtrot. They were labeled "bourgeois" and forbidden at public dancehalls. In the 1920s, tango, foxtrot and other jazz dances were replaced by the "mass plyaska" and "physical culture dance". The author looks at the individuals who were involved in the process, to understand whether they suffered or strived working within the Soviet system.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE October Revolution; 1917; S. M. Eisenstein; "October"; storming of the
   Winter Palace
AB The film "October" was supposed to present a canonical version of events connected to the victory of the Bolsheviks. To a large extent, this meant creating a "documentary illusion." In parallel with work on the film, meetings of participants of the armed uprising were organized on October 25 at the initiative of Istpart (Institute on the History of the Party). Archival documents indicate that the main goal of those meetings for filmmakers was to find everyday details, while speakers were setting forth their own memories of those days and were even trying to influence the formation of the script. These speeches reflected the struggle (which entered the final stage at that time) against the influence of L. D. Trotsky, in opposition to whom the figure of Lenin was put forward as the most important organizer of the October Revolution. Meeting participants were urged not to exaggerate the role of the Aurora. In addition, one of the meeting participants, K. A. Vasilevskii, sent several letters to Istpart and the film crew, in which he insisted on making changes to the script. This document is essentially a paper-based recollection of the person who directly led one of the units involved in the storming of the Winter Palace and the arrest and subsequent convoy of members of Provisional Government to the Peter and Paul Fortress. Information about the organized meetings with participants of the Revolution about the script was published in the press. This formed greater confidence in the historical credibility of the future film.

AB Research objectives: The article discusses the problem of searching and studying one of the most interesting historical complexes of the late Middle Ages in the Tomsk Cis-Ob region - the Toyanov town. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Toyanov town was the ethnic and political center of the Turkic-speaking population living in the area.
   Research materials: Archaeological search of the monument began in the second half of the nineteenth century and continues to the present. Several monuments of the late Middle Ages in the left bank of the Tom River were discovered and explored within this period. The materials found during excavations allow us to connect the history of the Tomsk Cis-Ob region of this time with the events in the entire forest-steppe zone of Western Siberia and the Turkic-Tatar state formations - in particular with the Siberian Khanate. Unfortunately, materials from the excavations are scattered and have not been published to date.
   Results and novelty of the research: This article analyzes recent articles on the Toyanov town and presents materials from the M.P. Gryaznov's archive containing the results of the 1924 excavations of the burial ground "Toyanov town" stored in the F.M. Dostoevsky Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography of Omsk State University. These materials indicate a certain proximity between the Toyanov town and other complexes of the Siberian Khanate.

TI ADAM SMITH'S SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY SOURCES
SO TERRA ECONOMICUS
LA English
DT Article
DE Adam Smith's "Theory of Moral Sentiments"; Joseph Schumpeter; Karl Marx;
   Sir William Petty
AB Joseph Schumpeter said that Adam Smith was sincere and very influential, but Schumpeter also said that Smith's "Wealth of Nations" nevertheless was neither original nor brilliant. As for moral philosophy, Schumpeter hardly read "The Theory of Moral Sentiments". Smith was an Aristotelian and a scholastic, Schumpeter said. These interpretations of Smith became standard, but were they correct? This paper argues instead that Smith was brilliant and original because his moral philosophy provided a capstone or crowning argument for seventeenth-century political economy. This connection of Smith to seventeenth-century sources is not entirely new of course. Karl Marx already said that "Wealth of Nations" depended largely on seventeenth-century writers such as Sir William Petty. Yet Marx saw only part of the picture because he, like Schumpeter later, undervalued Smith's moral philosophy. Predecessors in seventeenth-century political economy deeply influenced Smith, true, but he was not a passive recipient of this seventeenth-century influence. Instead, this paper argues, Smith labored to free political economy from its seventeenth-century reputation for atheism and immorality. Petty and his friend Thomas Hobbes and many other seventeenth-century practitioners of political economy had an infamous reputation as being empiricists who were hostile to moral philosophy in general and to Christian theories of right action in particular. Smith freed empirical political economy from its reputation for atheism.

AB For Russia, recent strengthening of world economic and political conditions places greater demands regarding procedures for science-based priorities of scientific innovation and the choice of approaches to human capital development. Accelerated technological upgrading of new economies involves expanding public policies on developing professional competences meeting the requirements of innovative development. When it comes to the innovative development of our country, its effectiveness will depend on proficiency and objectives of future specialists. The most significant problem of implementing public policy in science and advanced technologies is appropriate staffing of innovative activity. The analysis of people participating in science and innovation reveals their ageing in Academies of sciences and universities and research organizations through the last 10-15 years. The ageing was accompanied by decrease in the number of staff occupied with research and development, which has decreased three times over the last 10 years. Thus, there is a problem of insufficient staffing of research organizations. The paper shows that educative features of human potential do not correspond with the goals of renovated economy in modern Russia. The structure of specialties and competences by current system of higher education has fallen short of both challenges of innovative development of domestic economy and structural shifts in the world economy.

TI Sanctions' Policy: Unipolar or Multipolar World?

ID ECONOMIC SANCTIONS; SUCCESS
AB This article examines the origins of the United States' supremacy in the use of economic sanctions in the context of a wider discussion about the structure of the contemporary world order following the Cold War. Sanctions are understood as an instrument of power relations and a means of forcing "target" countries to fulfil the requirements of "sender" countries. The experience of deploying sanctions suggests that, from the point of view of economic power, the world today retains signs of unipolarity, while a polycentric world order is just one of the possible options for the future. The key research question is: why does the United States continue to have significant leverage in terms of implementing sanctions, despite the growing capabilities of other actors? In addition to U.S. dominance in the global financial system, two other factors are highlighted. The first is the relative weakness of the United Nations (UN) as a key global governance institution. While the United Nations is the only legitimate source of sanctions, it has far fewer institutional capabilities to run a sanctions policy compared to the United States. At the same time, the United States and other western powers successfully use the United Nations to increase the legitimacy of the unilateral measures, or play an active role in the UN Security Council, striving to legitimize their programmes and then supplementing them with their own unilateral measures. The second factor is the difference in the perception of sanctions by national governments and private companies. While national governments often criticize unilateral sanctions, private business tends to comply or over-comply with U.S. measures, even when the national government tries to protect it. As a result, even the most powerful economic actors cannot convert their economic power into political power to counterbalance the United States. The question of how long the United States will be able to maintain its supremacy, and how effective the sanctions will be, is a focus of future research.

AB The specifics of how scientific knowledge on international relations is formed have long been the subject of a discussion which is still ongoing. The author highlights the features of the relationship between the fundamental and applied levels of knowledge of international relations, analyzes the division of actual scientific knowledge and reflection upon practical international politics (which, in its most general form, is referred to as 'big ideas'). The relationship between science and international practice is considered in the aspect that scientific knowledge and 'big ideas' intersect, having a different nature and, in fact, being incomparable. The author comes to the conclusion that the development of international relations - as an objective science that meets the criteria of science - is associated with difficulties, which also complicates the formation of the applied level of research. As the science of international relations finds solutions to its epistemological problems and accumulates knowledge, prerequisites are created for the formation of its theoretical and applied levels in the fullest sense of the word. However, this process is not instantaneous, but requires constant attention from researchers.

AB The article explores Czech-Russian relations in a broad chronological framework, which includes historical patterns and approaches that influence bilateral contacts up to date. The author concludes that the ties established in the New Age based on ideas of Slavic unity and, more importantly, of Russia as a great Eastern power, the defender of oppressed peoples, and, therefore, an instrument for achieving Czech interests. However, its intellectual elite, since the middle of the 19th century, has always been divided into two self-sufficient groups - opponents of Russia and its supporters, who constantly have been influencing internal life. Ignoring Russia after collapse of the Eastern Bloc as an important factor in Czech foreign policy was eliminated at the beginning of the new millennium. It is symptomatic that the Crimea crisis of 2014, which should have pushed the Czechs away from Russia, because of historical parallels with the events of 1968, showed that in the context of the global crisis, significance of Russia for the Czech Republic only increase. Russia was always interested in strengthening influence in Central Europe and was set to use the possibility to spread its influence, whether by political, economic or ideological means.

AB Introduction. Red Soviet Cossacks were little studied by Soviet historical science, because their presence and number did not always correspond to the theory of class struggle. Most Cossacks opposed the Bolsheviks during the Civil War, but the Bolsheviks always tried to create their red Cossack military units. At first they tried to revive the old Cossack regiments of the tsarist army, but under the command of Soviet power supporters. Then they tried to mobilize the Cossacks in the Red army, but the mobilization did not give the expected result. Materials. The source used materials from the Cossack Department of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the State Archive of the Russian Federation; funds of the Red Cossack units in the Red Army (23rd Infantry Division) - Russian State Military Archive; information material on the Cossack parts of the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History; similar documentation stored in the funds of the Center for Documentation of Contemporary History of Rostov Region. The author used publications of Bolshevist and anti-Bolshevist periodicals, which show how the Don Cossacks and their Bolsheviks and their opponents characterized the Red Don Cossacks. Analysis. In summer 1918, the interest of Cossacks in economic relations with the cities of Central Russia played an important role, and some Cossack settlements supported the Bolsheviks in order not to break these economic contacts. Nevertheless, Cossack Soviet regiments were created by September-October, 1918. They consisted of volunteers, and their quantity was limited. In the documents of the Cossack Department of the Central Executive Committee we find refers to 4 Soviet Cossack regiments created in the first year after the October revolution. In fact, there were more Cossack units, but not all of them reached the number of a regiment. At the end of 1918, when the Red army launched the offensive, the number of Soviet Cossack regiments increased. Results. When forming Soviet Cossack regiments, the Bolsheviks tried to use old organizational forms - to revive the Don Cossack regiments of the tsarist army, but under new leadership. It succeeded partially. The attempts to mobilize the Cossacks in the Red Army did not give the expected result. In the event of sharp changes in the situation at the front in favor of the enemy, the mobilized either switched to his side or went home. The basis of forming Soviet Cossack units in 1918 formed the principle of voluntariness. Soviet Cossack units were formed primarily under general democratic slogans and where there was no obvious conflict between Cossack and non- Cossack population. In 1918, while the Bolsheviks did not pursue the policy of food dictatorship and did not curtail trade, a significant role for the Red Cossacks was played by the factor of their economic ties with large Russian economic centers. Cossack regiments of the Red Army inherited the high fighting qualities of the Cossack units from the old tsarist army, maneuverability and stamina inherent to the Cossacks, as evidenced by the high score they were given by the representatives of the hostile camp.

AB The article analyzes the empirical data of long-term monitoring studies presented in the collective monograph of scientists of the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences "Twenty-Five Years of Social Transformations in the Assessments and Judgments of Russians: The Experience of Sociological Analysis". The monograph presents rich and diverse data on the complex and sometimes contradictory image of Russia. On the basis of this data, the authors suggest the dichotomy of the collective memory of Russians: while the historic memory of Russians is variable and inconstant, their social memory as a means of reproducing sociocultural tradition in the mass consciousness is relatively stable. Historical memory in transforming societies serves both as the basis of solidarity and as a factor in the emergence of cleavages and conflicts due to contradictions in the understanding of significant events of the past. The authors state the uncertainty, blurring of the communicative, family and collective memory of the influence of the October Revolution of 1917 on the fate of individual families and society. The reasons for this are the lack of communication between generations, the lack of interest in the past and the lack of a pronounced ideological assessment of the results of the revolution. A positive attitude to the Soviet period is accompanied by a negative attitude to the revolution as a form of social development. Preferred are non-catastrophic forms of development, even if in fact they lead to stagnation. The tendency of positive evaluation of the Soviet period, which is consistently observed in Russian polls, is interpreted by the authors as a manifestation of the stability of social memory. The historical choice between models of a centralized communal and liberal state is conditioned by stable ideas about the need for state control over the main sectors of the economy and the priority of state rights and interests over individual ones. However, neither the historical nor the social memory of Russians represents shared ideals, value models and models of an optimal state structure. However, the people's lack of a single vision of the ideal of a social structure can be viewed as protection against potential revolutions and a condition for creatively searching and building the country's future through a dialogue of civil society with political power.

ID STATES
AB Although established political scientists have been developing the statehood typology for a long time, this task has not yet been completely solved. While considering this problem, the authors used various methods of comparative studies. The paper solves two main research problems. The first was to identify the key characteristics of small European countries in terms of modern global, regional, political, and economic processes. In the framework of this task, the main directions for identifying small countries were considered using both quantitative and qualitative indicators. The second task was to show the similarities and differences between small countries and limitrophes (border states). In the course of the analysis, the authors prove that all limitrophes are small countries, but not all small countries are limitrophes. In contrast to merely being a `small country,' a limitrophe is a political category, rather than economic or geographical. This, however, does not contradict the geographical or economic characteristic features of limitrophes. It was from these theoretical and methodological positions that Vadim Tsymbursky, the prominent political scientist, analyzed the problem. The problem of limitrophes is interdisciplinary. However, it is the methodological apparatus of political science that, to the authors, seemed to be optimal for disclosing the content of this scientific category. If a small state, from a political point of view, is an intermediate space between states or military and political alliances, and a limitrophe is a barrier, a `cordon sanitaire' separating them. The authors consider the Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) to be the benchmark example of limitrophe states.

AB The negative image of Ivan the Terrible is part of the national history created by the political and intellectual elites of post-Soviet Tatarstan. The historical fault o Ivan the Terrible from point of view of the elites is that he captured Kazan in 1552, which led to the loss of Tatar statehood, the decline of culture and economy, the persecution of Islam and violent Christianization. The results of our sociological research show that despite all efforts of the Tatar elite, a significant part of the ordinary inhabitants of Tatarstan, including the Tatars, positively evaluate the activities of Ivan the Terrible, not only in history of Russia, but also in the history of Tatarstan. Tatar elites have achieved very modest successes in promoting their version of national history. According to the results of our research, we can only talk about "partial Tatarization" or the formation of "national archipelagos".

TI CREATION OF "AFFILIATIVE POSTMEMORY" ABOUT THE EPOCH OF POLITICAL

AB This article will discuss the problem of working with the memory of the "traumatic" events of the "era of political repression". The author took the concept of "postmemory" M. Hirsch as the methodological basis of the study. Analysis of the concept of M. Hirsch gives an understanding of how a person's "affiliation" with an event takes place, allows us to analyze the mechanism of transition from a "memory policy" to a "memory practice". An intermediate link in the transition and reformatting of the "familiative" postmemory into "associative" is the "affiliative" post-memory, based on emotional involvement, emotional experience and coexperience. The purpose of my research was to study how to form an "affiliative" postmemory of the "era of political repression" among pupils of grades 9-11. The main methods are experiment, interviewing, observation, content analysis of students' creative work. As a result of the study the most sensitive topics of the "victim" (person / society) and "executioner" (state) were analyzed. The theme of the executioner was complicated by the experience of two feelings: "guilt" ("I am the victim") and "shame" ("I am the executioner") in understanding the events of this era. Also, it was revealed that the usual dichotomy "victim" - "executioner", "man" - "state" - is a significant simplification and prevents the formation of a more balanced picture about the events of the "era of political repression". The formation of an "affiliative" postmemory allows adding topics of personal responsibility, personal choice, civic consciousness and others to the conversation about these events.

AB In his text 'Wissenschaft als Beruf', Max Weber associates the understanding of science as a vocation with the scientist's ability to present the audience with 'inconvenient facts'. He argues that this presentation provides a 'full understanding of the facts' and overcomes any personal value judgment. This overcoming refers to Weber's understanding of scientific objectivity. I propose to interpret this understanding in the context of contemporary studies of public science communication. I pose the question, 'Should scientists objectively present inconvenient facts to the public or should they neglect objectivity in science-society communication?' I will start by legitimizing this question in the context of contemporary discussions on public science communication. To answer this question I will then use Heather Douglas's observations addressing irreducible complexity of objectivity as a conceptual framework. I will briefly describe, with some modifications, this idea in relation to Weber's representation of 'inconvenient facts'. I then will continue by referencing discussions concerning scientist's norms in public science communication and relate them to the formulations of objectivity above. In conclusion, I will offer an explanation of why the objectivity in Weber's interpretation remains relevant to regulate contemporary public science communication.

AB The paper discusses the processes of digital transformation of the political and legal systems of society in the Eurasian space (for example, the Russian state-legal organization). The authors discuss the process of introducing digital technology and artificial intelligence into the enforcement process, as well as the impact of digital technology on the political process. The content explains that a virtual digital space is currently being formed and most public relations are starting to unfold in it. At the same time, it is shown that in cyberspace, traditional value- normative regulators do not have the necessary effectiveness in regulating the interaction of people, and between people and virtual digital actors. The necessity of creating new regulatory systems and safety standards is substantiated.

DE natural language semantics; type theory; Agda; propositional attitudes;
   situation semantics
AB Traditional type-theoretical semantics lacks convenient instruments for taking into account contextual information. To cope with this deficiency, a type theory with records was proposed by Robin Cooper. However, it possesses limited capacities as to the formalization of such phenomena as the referential opacity of contexts. At the same time, a lot of functional programming languages based on type theory contain sophisticated module systems providing means for opening or hiding various information from one or another fragment of programs. This article deals with opportunities that type theory with records and modules opens for the formalization of contexts in natural language semantics. The formalization is implemented in the dependently typed functional language Agda. Using programming language for type-theoretical semantics is not without a reason. Type theory is closely connected not only to logic, but also to computing, and programming in particular. In the context of type theoretical semantics, we can understand meaning as something computable. That is why many semantic problems turn out to be connected with the development of methods (and programs) of meaning or referent calculation. The article outlines basic principles of formalization and its specific realization in Agda. Relation to situation semantics by Jon Barwise and John Perry is demonstrated. Examples of descriptions for contexts' referential opacity as well as the concepts of abstract meaning and meaning-in-use from situation semantics are provided. The Agda formalization code is freely available.

AB The article analyzes the problem of determining the real content of the institution of citizenship in Russia, reveals its quality and the degree of implementation of the concept and model of the Western European citizen and citizenship of the Modern Age. The article reveals the main provisions of the modern concept of citizenship, which is based on the ideas of Thomas Marshall. The core of this concept is two aspects of a citizen's existence that have institutional forms: (1) as an object of the state: a citizen, a passive member of the political community and (2) as a political actor with constitutional rights to participate in the governance of the nation-state. The transformation of the classical model of citizenship under the influence of globalization and migration is studied. The main positions of the Western and Russian participants of the discussion developed around these changes are presented. Anti-liberal sentiments and criticism of liberal democratic values and institutions, including national citizenship, are spreading in Central and Eastern European states, as well as in Russia. The hypothesis of the author of the article is as follows. There are political and legal forms fixed in the Constitution of the Russian Federation (1993) and in the law "On Citizenship" (2002) by the terms "citizen" and "citizenship", mainly corresponding to the Western European model of these phenomena. However, the content of these forms various aspects of the ontology of Russian citizens and their relations with the state does not correspond to the European model. The author shows that the origin of this discrepancy lies in the Soviet model of relations between the state and the population, which can be characterized as nominal citizenship and, in fact, allegiance. The article reveals the nature of Soviet citizenship as a heritage largely preserved in today's Russia. The author solves the problem of identifying the nature of citizenship in modern Russia using the methodology of a sociocultural approach and the theoretical model of the citizen. The use of this model allows testing the set of institutional, mental and personal conditions of the ontology of Russian individuals and drawing conclusions that the constitutional status of a citizen as a person with political rights to participate in the governance of the state is not realized in modern Russia. The author defines the current status of Russians as nominal, imitative, passive citizenship.

DE globalization; nation state; sovereignty; reformation; populism; global
   civil society; national interests
AB In early 21st century, in various parts of Europe and America there have been attempts of backsliding from free movement of people and capitals inherent to globalization era, and restoration of full sovereignty of a nation state. Presenting features of this trend are different: nationalist forces' coming to power in Eastern Europe, Brexit, election of D. Trump as U.S. President, the populists' victory in parliamentary elections in Italy. The Populism of diverse colors becomes a driving force of such attempts. The tendency mentioned above is based on a widespread dissatisfaction with the neo-liberal character of globalization coming from domination of international monopolies and oligopolies in this process, which neglect the variety of local conditions and prioritize their own vested interests. The supremacy of the market element gives important advantages to the strongest, the most mobile and faster developing participant of the process, not taking whichever national and social interests in consideration. At the same time, free cross-border displacement of human flows creates conditions for erosion of the European Christian identity, facilitates the appearance of hotbeds of the Islamic terrorism. Within the boundaries of the European Union, a protest against the bureaucratic character of integration processes regulation merges into the discontent with consequences of neo-liberal globalization. The abovementioned crisis trends make us address the experience of the past. The political crises of the contemporary history, which caused wars and revolutions, were often construed as harbingers of an inevitable collapse of the existing development model (suffice it to recall the forecasts of Karl Marx and his followers). However, not the death of capitalism was a result of historical evolution, but its reformation and the emergence of social welfare state. The crisis affiliated to globalization may have similar effect. There are quite a number of proposals aimed at the EU reforming. Efforts to improve or counteract at least the most vivid flaws of globalization processes are not excluded. This brings up the question about a subject or subjects of such attempts. The populist movement claims an actor's role. Yet there are doubts that it is able to play this role. At the same time, the civil society now takes on greater and greater importance in the sequence of events. Quite possibly, not only a national civil society could seriously contribute to reforming of globalization processes, but a gradually shaping global civil society using modern communication media as well. The experience tells us also that, first of all, consideration for and harmonization of national interests should become a direction of reforming, which means not only a complicated system of agreements between nation states and their associations, but gradual and far-reaching improvement of global governance institutions. However, the global civil society is hardly homogenious, and given the vast variety, heterogeneity and contradictions of national interests, the task of harmonization appears to be extremely difficult.

DE Subject of constitutional law; constitutional legal relations;

AB To the ideas of building constitutional legal relations in Russia returned in the early 90s of the XX century. The return to them is connected with changes in the social and political life of Russia, with recognition of the values of the rule of law, democratic processes. It is during this period that constitutional legal relations are replaced by state-legal relations. Understanding the essence of constitutional legal relations in the works of the post-Soviet period is reduced in fact to the terminological replacement of the concept of state-legal relations with constitutional-legal relations.
   State-legal relations and constitutional legal relations differ in the following features:
   The goal of state-legal relations is reduced to state construction. The purpose of constitutional legal relations is to build a state of law.
   The subject of state-legal relations is the relationship regarding the organization of state power, the subject of constitutional legal relations the principles of human-state interaction.
   The leading subject of state-legal relations is the state, the subjects of constitutional legal relations are equal, while the leading role of the people (man) is recognized.
   State-legal relations determine the content of public legal relations and are inextricably linked with administrative-legal relations. Constitutional legal relations define the meaning of all branches of Russian law, fulfilling the leading role.
   State-legal relations are distinguished by the presence of many specific legal ties deeply penetrating into public law relations, including the boundaries of the realization of human rights. Constitutional legal relations are largely general in nature, defining the meaning of constitutional principles while not interfering in the implementation of sectoral legal relations.
   In contrast to state-legal relations, constitutional legal relations have the following features:
   First. Constitutional legal relations are aimed at achieving the development goals of the Russian state, namely, the construction of a legal state. They are intended to limit public will.
   Second. Constitutional legal relations are the framework of the entire system of legal relations in the Russian Federation, provide its internal unity, hierarchy, and form the directions of its development.
   Third. The constitutional legal relations lay the foundation for all other types of legal relations in the Russian Federation, including state-legal relations.
   Fourth. Constitutional legal relations, having the highest degree of generalization, can find further implementation in any other types of legal relations, while creating multilayered systems of legal relations.
   Fifth. Constitutional legal relations are developed under the influence of the development of the concept of the legal state.
   In conclusion, the following conclusions can be drawn:
   In the science of constitutional law, two types of legal relations should be distinguished by constitutional legal relations and state-legal relations.
   The type of legal relations is due, among other things, to the role in the system of public relations.
   Constitutional legal relations are the most generalized, Fundamental legal relations forming the framework of the system of legal relations of the Russian Federation and ensuring its internal unity and hierarchy in the process of building a legal state.

DE Wittgenstein; N-operator; identity; first-order logic; propositional
   function; logical equivalence
AB The correct logical notation proposed by Ludwig Wittgenstein in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus consists of two provisions: the complete elimination of the sign of identity (the identity or non-identity of objects should be expressed through the identity or non-identity of signs (5.53)) and the postulated ability to obtain any first-order logic formulas through the application of the N-operator. The first position rejects the definition of identity given by Leibniz (adopted also by Russell in Principia Mathematica) and in the Tractatus is justified in a certain way (the author does not consider Wittgenstein's arguments). The second position is introduced without any argument. Regarding the rules for eliminating the identity sign and applying the N-operator, Wittgenstein limited himself to examples. The aim of this review is to summarize the main recent results of various attempts to present the correct logical notation proposed by Wittgenstein in a systematic way. Disputes over the fundamental possibility or impossibility of the systematic use of logic without an identity sign with varying degrees of success have been going on since the publication of the Tractatus (the reaction of Ramsay and Russell and the consequences for the Principia Mathematica project are well known). Recent works by Juliet Floyd and Gregory Landini have returned interest to the problem). But significant success in understanding Wittgenstein's intentions has been linked to recent results by Kai Wehmeier and especially by Tim Lampert. Regarding the definition of the rules for using the N-operator, substantial success was reached by Brian Rogers and Kai Wehmeier. The first part of this article discusses the rules and the algorithm for translating first-order logic formulas through the N-operator proposed by Rogers and Wehmeier (the well-known debate between Robert Fogelin and Peter Geach regarding the N-operator is also briefly considered). The second part sets forth the algorithm proposed by Wehmeier for translating standard formulas of first-order logic into a language without an identity sign. In the third part, the author considers another similar algorithm (given by Lampert) and the corresponding criticism of the translation rules of Rogers and Wehmeier. In the final part of this article, additional arguments in favor of Lampert's position are formulated.

AB The research aims to study the technique of granulation as a kind of a decorative art, which, along with other kinds, characterises a historically important period for the Russian people and state, when the path of Russian political and cultural, including artistic, development was determined. The author compares the development of granulation art with the way of other kinds of a decorative art and considers parallels of Old Russian granulation development with other Slavic peoples' jewel art. The main sources for the research are adornments from Russian hoards and burials and data on the technology of granulation. A review of styles reveals a specific history of granulation art. Style is characterised as a unity of decorative form created by granulation techniques; it may be associated with ideology. The volume-geometric style of the end of the 9th and the first half of the 10th centuries and the partition-figurative style of the first half of the 10th century were based on the unity of technical and decorative properties of miniature metal details: the fitting of the construction of the products from granules and filigree parts; laying of grains on the surface entirely, drawing of a contour by lines. Dimensions of grains and filigree parts are varied (from fractions of a millimeter to 1.0 and 2.0 mm). The unity of filigree and embossing techniques strengthens the decorative role of grains, the spherical shape allows the granules to form geometric elements. In the linear-geometric style of the 10th and early 11th centuries, the role of the granulation line was important; firstly, it was used to divide the composition into zones, then it was used to form borders. Geometric elements were of different sizes. The geometric style of the late 10th and the 11th centuries advanced to equal rhombuses and triangles. An ideal rhythmic ornament was created without any meanings. There is a tendency to a standard grain of D=0.5-0.7 mm. The ornamental arsenal accumulated is claimed in the sculptural and figurative style, which actively developed since the second half of the 11th century. Each ornamental device and technique plays its own role: embossing creates a figured base, granulation details it. Different grain parameters are used again. Anthropomorphic and architectural motifs are created from grains and filigree parts, they tend to a pagan worldview. In the 12th century, the main motif of the Byzantine floral ornament with Christian symbolism (a lily) was laid with grains. As a result, the chronology of styles and the technological basis for their emergence have been identified. The development of geometric ornamentation in grains looks as a parallel to ornamentation development in wood carving, fabric and embroidery. Separate depictive compositions show parallels with cloisonne enamel, niello and embossing. Analogies to products in figurative and geometric styles are found in Moravian and Polish jewelry. Starting with the use of technical qualities in design and decoration, granulation shows its own decorative side, which sometimes overcomes technical restrictions creating figurative and plant motifs, reflecting the main ideological confrontation between pagan and Christian worldviews.

DE Russia Abroad; the Russian higher education in Harbin; emigration;
   Russian-Chinese relationships
AB This article analyzes the activities of the largest university in China in the 1920 to 1940s - the Harbin Polytechnic Institute (HPI), established by Russian emigrants to maintain the Chinese Eastern railway (CER). The fates of CER and HPI were closely associated. The establishment of the Institute was initiated and supported by the railway administration, which provided a building in I Iarbin and offered substantial funds for the maintenance of HPI. In turn, the Institute trained personnel for the railways and construction projects in Manchuria. The article places the history of the Institute in the context of the history of Manchuria and Russian-Chinese relations. Over its history of nearly one hundred years the Institute repeatedly changed its name The turns in the political situation in China also led to changes in the governing structure of the Institute, in its educational activities and its teaching personnel. The present research builds on a broad historiographical and source base, including memories of graduates of the Institute, items from the Harbin press, and unpublished archival documents. Documents of the Board of CER, reports, personal files of teachers shed light on issues including the Institute's corporate academic culture, its student composition, the organization of the educational process, and its sources of funding, as well as the USSR's pragmatic approach towards the Institute. Established in 1920, the Institute survived several crises. The present case study reveals the role of higher education in strengthening Russian-Chinese relations and cultural diversity of China. In conclusion, the IiPI made an important contribution to the preservation of national identity among the Russian youth in China and supported their adaptation. At the same time, it is fair to say that the Institute, and hence Russian emigres, made a significant contribution to the establishment of a system of higher education in China.

AB The Ukrainian crisis has led to a serious deterioration in Russia-EU relations. Meanwhile, there are both common features and differences in approaches of different European Union countries to the events in Ukraine. The Federal Republic of Germany as the largest state of the Union most interested in resolving the crisis exercises the greatest influence on the solidaty position of the EU. In turn, the formation of Germany's stance is seriously influenced by positions of political parties in the country, especially those belonging to the "big coalition" in power The standpoints of the leading German parties on key issues of resolving the Ukrainian crisis are close. They recognize only political measures aimed at normalizing the situation, and support the Minsk Agreements. Russia's "annexation" of the Crimea is condemned, but at the moment it is "out of the brackets". In German politics, there are two main approaches to cooperation with Moscow: supporters of the first approach are in favor of maintaining the sanctions until the implementation of the Minsk-2; supporters of the second one require rejection of the sanctions policy and improving bilateral Russian-German relations. Spain, on the contrary, due to geographical remoteness and a low level of economic relations with Russia, perceives the Ukrainian crisis almost exclusively through the prism of national interests related to the problem of preserving the country's territorial integrity. This article analyzes the approach of Germany (on the example of the political parties' standpoints) as most characteristic for the EU, and that of Spain (comparing Catalonia and the Crimea) as most reflecting the specificity of individual EU countries' positions. The question of similarities and differences between the situations in Catalonia and the Crimea is a "case study" of the broader problem of the correlation between the principles of maintaining a country's territorial integrity and the right of nations for self-determination. The priority in this analysis is given to the situation in Catalonia, and the situation in the Crimea is viewed in a wider context of Spain's attitude to the Ukrainian crisis.

   statistics; philosophy of crime; science methodology
AB The aim of the article is to actualize and give a new meaning to the concept "criminal statistics", which emerged during the formation of legal science and eventually became axiomatic, to fill it with a more modern content based on the analysis of the historical experience of the pre-revolutionary Russian legal science. The master's thesis "Criminal Statistical Studies" of Nikolai Neklyudov, published as a separate edition in 1865, is analyzed. The article draws parallels in the historical and contemporary context regarding the approaches to the study of crime and the criminal, which allows the author to distance himself from the "outdated" knowledge of legal reality and propose a different way of studying the criminal environment and the formation of the criminal policy of the state. The study reveals the main provisions of Neklyudov's concept of criminal statistics as a scientifically based methodology. The scholar proposes to start with the age of a person, which accumulates the fullness of the person's spiritual and physical features and allows establishing the interrelations and the interdependence of human behavior and the external environment in which this behavior manifests itself The central element of the concept is the concept of criminal statistics. The main scientific approach to the study of immoral and criminal acts is determined: a philosophical one, which makes it possible to look at criminal life as a phenomenon with its causes, forms of manifestation, conditions of existence and modifications, both quantitative and qualitative. The analysis of Neklyudov's thesis shows several important and scientifically relevant provisions. Criminal statistics as a method of scientific knowledge is one of the fundamental components of criminological research. Statistical data are objective; therefore, it is possible to identify both quantitative and qualitative (via content analysis) characteristics of "criminal life". Criminal statistics provides a comprehensive vision of this life, in which there is a person with their inner world and the environment they live in, and which affects their behavior. Criminal statistics, with its educational potential, can influence the choice of the criminal law strategy of the state and the legal (sectoral: criminal, administrative, etc.) policy. Criminal policy together with criminal statistics is defined as the "weal of modern culture". The latter conclusion has a deep meaning and an eternal importance not only for the development of criminology as a science, but also for legal science and practice in general. The legal policy of the state is one of the forms of manifestation of a certain level of political and legal culture of society and, therefore, the level of the very life of this society. If statistics indicate the external causes that support a low standard of living and a high level of crime, the weakness and inertia of the state become apparent.

ID SECURITY; IDENTITY; POLICIES; FUTURE
AB The article analyzes the main factors and trends in the transformation of national state as a result of deep social and political shifts in the modern world. The key determinants of this transformation include the rising role of non-Western countries, ethno-social and ethno-political changes in the developed Western countries, the split of elites, growing political tension in societies, formation of supranational and transnational political entities, the divergence of transnational and national elites' interests. The EU member states face numerous challenges caused by demographic shifts, mass foreign cultural migration, identity crisis, ethno-political conflicts, separatism, as well as by political consequences of technological shifts and social innovations, formation of new regional alliances and centers of power in the single global world. The article investigates adaptive changes and politico-institutional transformation paths of national states as a response to these challenges. The authors study the main prerequisites and reasons for the strengthening of Euroscepticism and populism in the EU member states, concluding that these political phenomena are closely connected with the crisis and transformation of the classical European national state. Furthermore, it is shown that attempts to forcefully form a nation and build nation-states in the post-Soviet space often lead to serious social, cultural and political problems in multi-ethnic post-Soviet societies. Such countries face political instability, up to the onset of symptoms peculiar to incapacity of a State and fundamental degradation of national statehood. These problems are caused, on the one hand, by the lack of social consolidation, the presence of powerful clan and oligarchic structures, political divisions and the alienation of elites from the general population; on the other hand - by global processes and external pressure on the post-Soviet states.

DE integration; korenizatsiya; Circassians/Adygs; Shapsugs; migration;

AB The integration of the native peoples (Circassians/Adygeans, Shapsugs) and migrants at the Sochi coast of the Black Sea is analyzed in the article based on state archive materials, memories and analytical works of the participants of the events of the second half of the 19th - the first third of the 20th centuries. Some of the archival information was first introduced into scientific discourse. The topic is of theoretical and applied relevance. It is not sufficiently studied in the Western Caucasus regional historiography, and it is an object of political debate. The characteristic features of the sociocultural and economic integration of different ethnic groups are revealed in the article. The native population of the Black Sea region and migrants were introduced into the legal field of the Russian Empire in the second half of the 19th - the first third of the 20th centuries. Personal freedom and land allotments were provided to them. The social status of Circassian and Russian community members became identical. This further spread to all migrants at the time. The development of agriculture in the region was a sign of economic integration. The Russian administration used the term "colonization of the Black Sea region" in the 19th century. The essence of this term was the region's settlement and introduction of land into economic use. Migrants made a major contribution to this process. Russian migrants' and Cossacks' adaptation to the new conditions was not always successful. Migrants from Turkey (Armenians, Greeks), Georgia (Georgians) adapted their farming to the landscape environment successfully. Their economic specialization (horticulture, tobacco growing, animal husbandry) proved to be more stable and was preserved in the first third of the 20th century. The author believes that the population's sociocultural and economic integration into the modernized (socialist) society was successfully pursued by the state in the 1920s-1930s. Changes in the forms of economy, cooperation in agriculture, a new (recreational) specialization were the signs of economic integration. The population increase and the social infrastructure development in the region were consequences of the integration. The USSR citizen's unified rights and obligations were granted to all ethnoses with no exceptions. Identical executive authorities were formed throughout the country, including the Sochi Black Sea Coast. These were rural councils and agricultural enterprises in national settlements (Russian, Armenian, Greek, Georgian and others). Representatives of ethnic groups became heads of administrative bodies and artels in rural areas. Korenizatsiya ("putting down roots") was of great importance. Korenizatsiya measures included elimination of illiteracy, establishment of primary schools (of the first stage) and training of population in them, record keeping in native (ethnic) languages, formation of the national personnel.

AB Information technologies have been actively used by consulting firms in the U.S. political process since the beginning of the 21st century. On the prepared ground of highly-commercialized industry of election races, digital technologies became yet another tool for influencing broad masses of the population, gradually crowding out traditional mass media. For the "customer" (i.e. politicians), digital technologies turned out to be attractive due to theirfinancial accessibility and some sort of elitism (or closeness), due to the specifics of their usage and development. The combination of these qualities gave rise to a narrow group of party-oriented large companies o f fering campaign management services on the Internet. Today, it is appropriate to speak of a complete cycle, in which politics adopts the marketing tools, and business actively uses political processes inside the country to achieve their interests beyond its borders. These ties open up questions upon the limits of the American leadership on a global scale in relation to the new tools of influencing the broad masses of the population, regulating cyberspace, as well as upon the transformation of the state role perception, security policy and the confrontation between Russia and the United States in the information war. The first part of the article traces the evolution of digital instruments used in election processes in the U.S. since 2004, including the development of big consulting companies and key people who started their careers in political PR at the early age of Internet. The second part suggests the reader recent research outcomes on the subjects of big data usage and social networks' influence on political and psychological perception of Internet users, including the OCEAN method of targeted advertising research. The third part opens up a discussion on how far politicians and marketing specialists can go to attract big audiences. It poses questions of rebalancing between traditional mass media and digital technologies, and how both industries may change to defeat one another. Finally, the article draws a parallel between todays media revolution and the declaration of will in the early years of American nation-building - Thomas Paine's "Common Sense" and Alexander Hamilton's "The Federalist Papers".

AB This article presents the publication of an inscription from Tanais dating from the first half of the second century AD; some of its fragments were found at the beginning of the twentieth century and others during excavations in the 1990s. The inscription was cut on a large marble block and is a dedication by a thiasos. Twenty names have survived in the inscription (one of them appears twice). Some of them reflect Roman influence. Two of the persons mentioned at the beginning of the list were Roman citizens, as can be seen from their names: the citizenship of one of them can be traced back to the Julio-Claudian era and that of the other to the Trajan era, which provides the terminus post quem of the inscription. Two other persons were not Roman citizens, but their parents' affection for Rome resulted in choosing Latin names for their children. One of the names in question, is unique and reflects not just the Roman influence but familiarity with Latin literature. This provides rare evidence of how in the second half of the first century AD Roman influence in the Bosporus was not only political or military: there were admirers of Roman culture and literature living there, who obviously knew the Latin language. Many of the names in the inscription are Greek ((featured twice), ). One of them () had apparently made its way to the Bosporus from Asia Minor. Two other names (mu) are of Persian origin, but had been adopted from the South Pontic region. There are only three Sarmatian names (), which is an unusually small number for inscriptions found in Tanais. One tentatively restored name might be Jewish (); if some other versions of its restoration are accepted, it should be included in the group of Greek names. One further name () belongs to the category of Lallnamen of unclear origin. Three of the members of the thiasos mentioned in this inscription are also mentioned in two other thiasos inscriptions (two in CIRB 1262 and one in CIRB 1266), which enables placing all the three inscriptions into the same chronological group.

AB Introduction. In Russia, the problem of interaction and search for balance in the 'center - periphery' system is considered to be common and is an impulse to socio-economic differentiation. However, no less important is the factor in multi-ethnicity, which organizes the space of Russia into a set of interconnected individual locations associated with certain ethnic groups. Features of the ethno-national space largely determine the (in)stability of the development of the state, which increases relevance of research in this field. The objective of this piece of research is to analyze the specifics of development and the potential of the ethno-national space of modern Russia as a factor in nation building.
   Materials and Methods. Strategic situational analysis (the SWOT analysis technique) was used as the main method, which makes it possible to consider the subject field, relying on factors that capture the dynamics of the current situation.
   Results. The authors have identified the historical and genetic, legal, institutional, managerial, programmatic, ethno-mental and other factors that comprehensively characterize the modern ethno-national space of Russia as a complex system that translates the essence and nature of the relationship between ethnic groups within the state. The identified factors have been evaluated in terms of strengths or weaknesses, opportunities or threats. A SWOT matrix has been developed, stating the prevalence of weaknesses and threats; in accordance with this matrix, development risks that can accelerate negative ethno-national processes have been identified.
   Discussion and Conclusion. On the whole, the ethno-national space of Russia has a contrasting nature: some factors simultaneously relate to both the strengths and weaknesses of the SWOT matrix. There has been a decrease in the acuteness of ethno-national problems in society as well as a reduction in the proneness to conflict and interethnic discord. The main conflicts and protests have been localized within the socio-political sphere, the electoral issues being their catalyst currently. The results of the study can be used by state executive and administrative bodies to improve the ethno-national sphere, to adjust certain areas of ethno-national policies and spatial development in the context of nation building.

DE definition; cluster concepts; necessary and sufficient features
AB The article presents problems that arise when we try to define cluster concepts by listing their necessary and sufficient features. This definition does not work because for cluster concepts none of the features is necessary, but all together the features are sufficient. The article considers a very original way of defining cluster concepts developed by David Cooper, called sufficiency definition. Although this approach is disputable, it is interesting in the sense that it allows a better understanding of the nature of cluster concepts. Cooper proposed to apply to them the definition of the form: "A =(dfn) Something having sufficient of the properties P-1, P-2, ... P-n". The main difference between such definitions and traditional ones is that they contain an indication of a sufficient number of properties. The reference to a sufficient number of properties is justified by the fact that in relation to cluster concepts it is impossible to list necessary conditions for their application. When we need to define one or another cluster concept, we list only those properties, the presence or absence of which allows us to apply it. A sufficient definition is the most appropriate way in this case to define cluster concepts. Interesting objections and sophisticated arguments against the theory of sufficient definitions are raised by Steven Boer. In particular, he suggested to differentiate "strongly backed" and "weakly backed" cluster concepts and showed what difficulties the theory of sufficient definitions faces. His conclusion is that sufficient definitions can be applied only to a limited number of "strongly backed" cluster concepts. But this conclusion is not fatal for the theory of sufficient definition, because its main conclusions do not rest on the semantic aspect of the definition, but on the pragmatic one. The reason is that all depends on how the definition is used in various linguistic practices. Cooper called this reason the "pragmatics" of definition.

DE basic law of thought; principle of identity; Kant's philosophy of
   mathematics; Boole's algebra of logic
AB In some matters, the philosophical significance of historical and logical research cannot be overestimated. First, because any significant philosophical system is based on a certain logic, rarely pronounced, and its explication helps to clarify the main points, reveal the genesis of this system and, possibly, avoid its frankly false interpretations. Immanuel Kant's doctoral thesis "A New Elucidation of the First Principles of Metaphysical Cognition (Principiorum primorum cognitionis metaphysicae nova dilucidatio)", presented at the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Konigsberg in September 1755, can be considered his first serious work devoted to the actual problems of metaphysics. This treatise is remarkable, for, in it, Kant criticized two fundamental principles of the then dominant Leibniz-Wolff metaphysics, namely, the principles of contradiction and sufficient reason. He proposes to replace them with the principle of identity for the basis and criterion of all truths and the principle of the determining basis for finding the source of true knowledge. In his critical philosophy, Kant considers reason and mind as cognitive abilities that constitute rational thinking in general. Logic is the science of thinking, and general pure logic contains its basic and necessary, a priori principles. Any thinking, according to Kant, is based on the law of identity because no thinking about the world would be possible, firstly, if we could not perceive the identity of the objects of thinking in the process of perceiving the diverse in time and, secondly, without the identity of the perceiving subject. Thus, it must be admitted that the status of the law of identity has not changed much in Kant's critical philosophy, just like his idea of distinguishing between logical and real foundations of knowledge. Despite the fact that the origin of the first systems of symbolic logic is not associated with traditional metaphysics, it seems that it is not accidental; the course of George Boole's reasoning about the basic principle of logic surprisingly resembles that of early Kant. First, he formulates the fundamental law of thought, based on some version of the law of identity for classes and then deduces from it the law of contradiction. Then he turns to one of the most important tasks of Kant's critical philosophy to identify the elementary actions of thinking to create conditions for the construction of an adequate theory of consciousness. In his unpublished notes on the nature of logic, Boole writes that it is absolutely wrong to define logic as an art or a science of reasoning, since it is impossible to define the process of reasoning in any way without first analyzing the process of thinking, conceptualizing and judging. In addition, it is not enough just to recognize the existence of such processes and describe their objects. Their laws must be established. According to Boole, logic is the science of thought and its laws, expressed in operations on the concepts of judgments and reasoning and in language.

AB In the world of postmodernism and the global transformations of today, the problem of political forecasting is acute. This problem can be solved, among other things, by studying political values and political activity of the modern Russian youth. The laws of the Russian Federation enshrine political organizations and youth parliaments as institutional forms of political participation of the youth. In this study, the current state of such organizations and their potential in ensuring the conventional political activity of young people is illustrated by the cases of Altai Krai and Novosibirsk Oblast. The organizations' number, activity and awareness of them among young people are used as indicators of their efficiency. Based on valid Internet sources, expert interviews with leaders of youth political organizations and youth parliaments, the authors of the article have concluded that such organizations have limited opportunities for organizing youth political activity. Only the Young Guard of United Russia, the Komsomol and the LDPR youth organization, all not large in number, have the potential to mobilize youth. The mentioned organizations are helped by patron parties. They ensure the implementation of their parties' projects. The low efficiency of regional youth parliaments is due to their subordination to regional legislative bodies. The analysis of the results of mass surveys among Altai Krai and Novosibirsk Oblast residents aged 14-30 showed they know little about youth political organizations and about these organizations' activities. The fulfillment of these organizations' functions is viewed as insufficient. The lack of assurance among young people regarding their abilities to influence the political situation has led to the youth being reluctant in terms of their political activities. Finally, the conclusion is drawn regarding the dialectical unity of the state and level of youth political organizations' and youth parliaments' political activity on the regional level and their positions in the cognitive space of the youth.

AB Russia's advance into Central Asia posed issues of administrative-political, legal and economic development of the region. The issues were aggravated by the multi-ethnicity of the population and different religious dogmas. Differences in the socioeconomic development between Russia and Central Asia were reinforced by the presence of nomadic and settled peoples. Therefore, a need for differentiation in approaches to different territories and peoples of the region became explicit. Several territorial governance clauses were issued to deal with the new territories (1865, 1867, 1873, 1886, 1901, 1903, etc.). The inseparability of military and administrative power was maintained by the introduction of the Governor-General position in July 1867. Administrative issues were governed together with military tasks. Overall, the main duty of the Turkestan Governor-General was to ensure order and political calm and to consolidate the region firmly. The gradual spread of the Russian influence was followed by incorporation into the economic and civil life of the Russian state. The current article distinguishes the core principles of the Russian policy implemented in the Turkestan region in 1865-1917. Four main principles were distinguished. (1) The study of Turkestan as a way to strengthen the central authority and facilitate the rapprochement of Russian and local peoples. It included learning of the local languages, religious traditions of the population, organization of special courses in oriental studies, distribution of the Russian language among the local administrations and population. (2) Avoidance of conflicts and building good-neighborhood relations. (3) No direct intervention in the internal life of the population; preservation of local self-government. (4) Dissemination of all-Russian administrative and governing principles: equal responsibility of officials, regardless of their Russian or local origin; a tax system based on the form of economic activity, not on nationality, etc.

DE migration; diversity; integration; integration policies; multi-level
   governance; decentralization; mainstreaming; interculturalism
AB Multiple changes in the development of migration processes, in their socio-economic and political context in the receiving societies require in return revising the concept of integration and reforming practices of integration policy. The latter is being transformed in three main areas. First, the decentralization of integration management is taking place, primarily by strengthening of authority, activity and responsibility of local governments. Secondly, multiactor mainstreaming is being formed. There is a shift away from targeted measures directed to migrants and their descendants towards generic social policies aimed at whole of society. Nevertheless, inclusive long-term needs-based and area-based practices are implicitly centered on migrants and ethnic minorities and combined with direct temporary initiatives affecting them. The pool of stakeholders of integration policy is expanding to involve whole of government, as well as private sector and civil society in the development and implementation of this policy. Thirdly, the urban management system is being restructured on the basis of intercultural principles. At the local level, intercultural practices are spreading in different areas of society. These changes have already led to some positive results. However, progress is not yet solid and has not been achieved in all areas. There are risks of negative effects of reforms. The complexities of multi-level interactive governance of integration and the limitation of intercultural policies by the local framework do not allow to assert the change of state-centric models of assimilation ism and multiculturalism to a new paradigm of cultural differences organization on a national scale. At the moment, it is rather a set ofsocial experiments in the field of mainstreaming and interculturalism dispersed in cities. However, in the long term, the changes that are taking place may lead to a formation of a new - more efficient, inclusive and cohesive - version of state-level diversity management.

AB The authors examines the dependence of tax rates by direct and indirect taxes. The research methodology is based on the authors' approach based on the construction of scatter diagrams, as well as the use of correlation and regression analysis. To calculate regression indices, data of 2007-2018 was sampled from 87 countries (10 indicators), including countries of different types (third world, developing and developed). The authors analyse the structure of tax revenues by type of taxes in the EU, depending on the socio-economic development of the country.
   The results of the analysis show no clear dependence between VAT and corporate tax rates. However, there is correlation between the rate of VAT and personal income tax. Mostly it is due to the level of socioeconomic development of the countries. Economically developed EU countries replenish the state budget revenues mostly by direct taxes. However, if indirect tax rates are high, their share in the national GDP is still quite remarkable (for example, in Denmark and Sweden). Meanwhile, in developing countries there is a clear predominance of consumption taxes in GDP (Croatia, Hungary).
   At the same time, there is a significant impact of political factors that are not amenable to mathematical evaluation. This, however, explains the results obtained by the authors. It has been noted that tax revenues from direct taxes prevail in developed countries, whereas developing countries prefer indirect taxes.

AB Today the level and quality of education have a direct impact on the economic development of any country. Over the past 10-15 years the Russian state and society have been going through a difficult and ambiguous period of reforming all spheres of life. Obviously the ultimate goal of these reforms is accelerated modernization, a breakthrough in socioeconomic and political well-being, the creation of a strong, stable state, the formation of a prosperous society. As a methodology of research the authors used the analysis of scientific literature on the theory and practice of education management; the study of official documents, materials of meetings, conferences, symposia on the stated problem; socio-pedagogical monitoring of the municipality using the methods of mass surveys, content analysis, social, psychological and pedagogical experiment, observation. In conclusion the authors come to need for a well-functioning system of training highly intelligent specialists who will be able to work effectively in high-tech manufacturing of the 21st century of the Russian Federation. New time puts forward new requirements for education, including such as the creation of conditions for mass vocational education while preserving elite higher education based on the principles of the selection of applicants, as well as providing opportunities for citizens at any age, at any time, anywhere, regardless of social status receive any necessary quality education.

TI HIGH-PRECISION LONG-RANGE CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS AND NUCLEAR ARMS CONTROL
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE high-precision weapons; long-range non-nuclear weapons; arms control;
   international security
AB The article studies the development, production and deployment of high-precision long-range conventional weapons by the world's leading military powers - the USA, Russia, and China. These weapons include non-nuclear systems with a range of more than 600 km capable of hitting the target by a single warhead with a probability of 0.5. The article focuses on air-, sea- and ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as hypersonic systems. The latter comprise cruise missiles with a scramjet engine and boost-glide complexes which rely on stages of ballistic missiles to boost a glide vehicle to hypersonic speeds. Hypersonics are less vulnerable for interception by missile defense systems. However, they also have a number of disadvantages of both technical and military-political nature. Existing high-precision long-range conventional weapons - with the exception of a massive attack scenario which is extremely unlikely in the absence of a full-scale war - can hardly have a significant impact on the balance of strategic nuclear forces. In the future, however, improvements in weapons performance, including hypersonic ones, will make it possible to transfer the core functions of strategic deterrence from nuclear to non-nuclear arms. Moreover, systems in question may aggravate strategic uncertainty due to their dual nature: they can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads and utilize support infrastructure for both conventional and nuclear military operations. Therefore, the use of high-precision long-range conventional weapons bears a high risk of a rapid escalation of an armed conflict all the way up to a massive nuclear exchange. The difficulty lies in the fact that traditional arms control measures are not applicable to high-precision conventional weapons. Their regulation should take a form of an incremental process with the final result likely to be less ambitious compared to nuclear arms control arrangements. A legally binding arms control regime for these systems would be hard to achieve mostly because it is virtually impossible to establish an effective verification regime. A more realistic alternative would be some form of parallel political statements on partial quantitative restriction for deployed long-range non-nuclear weapons and possibly limited data exchanges.

AB The article discusses Kyrgyz migrants' future plans, which were the focus of a study conducted from 2016 to 2018 in the Siberian city of Tomsk. Drawing on scholarship in the anthropology of migration, and through biographical interviews and participant observation at one of the city's private migration service centres, the author explores the vision the Kyrgyz migrants have for their own future and the future of their families, and whether they see this future as transnational. The transnational approach was used to analyse the practices in the migrants' everyday life both 'here' and 'there'. Further, their cross-border political, economic, and socio-cultural ties are examined, and it is shown how these constitute the transnational space encompassing both the host country and the country of origin. The article also looks into the role diasporic communities play in the formation and maintenance of such ties, and concludes that the narrative of homecoming or the 'myth of return' is the central element in the majority of migrant stories which shapes migrant strategies for the future.

AB The Arctic is facing a combination of changes in environmental, socio-economic, institutional and legal frameworks which define the futures of sustainable development of the northern regions. Impact of climate change is among the key variables in selection of societal responses to emerging challenges and to design of adaptive governance options under ongoing transformations. Innovative system of climate services in the Arctic is one of its core elements; it is at the initial stages of formation, and active international discussion is underway today about the emerging global, regional and national markets for climate services. The authors present methods and results of joint research conducted by IMEMO RAS as a partner of 44 members of international scientific consortia Blue Action under the EU Horizon-2020 Research and Innovation Programme. The article discusses major approaches to climate services for sustainable development in the Arctic, including the requirements of the end-users from various sectors and activities. It describes the participatory co-design of their future structure and challenges identified by various stakeholders from the North, as well as their vision incorporated into three foresight scenarios for Yamal 2040 that had been developed by the project partners. Among them are the so-called "Reinventing Itself", "Gas Boom" and "Snow Queen". They are based on a set of environmental, socio-economic, technological and political factors and drivers of the Arctic change that might affect the pathways for Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO) sustainable development. The outcomes from these scenarios allow various stakeholders to identify possible opportunities and risks, and to undertake beforehand the effective response actions to adapt to future transformations.

The retrospective analysis of the events, which took place during the last months of the socialist state, reveals that by the autumn of 1989 the republic had been facing all the preconditions typical for the internal crisis. The author distinguishes the growth of the opposition supporters' number, the creation of the opposition organizational structure and its leaders who put forward the attractive slogans and organized the actions provoking the severe crisis, the availability of the strong political, ideological and material support by the external actors and underestimation of mentioned processes by the state leadership. The GDR dissolution led to the so-called "color-coded" state coups in the East Europe and was a prelude to the bipolar system dismantling.

DT Article
DE European Academy of Religion; identity; minorities; migration; parallel
   communities; religious values; secular values; secularization
AB The transformations of religious landscape are taking place in the modern European society. The authors highlight three main factors of these changes. The first one is secularization, which has led to a sharp decline in the influence of religious organizations (mainly churches of different Christian confessions) on the political, social and personal life of Europeans. The culture of a secular society is widespread. Christian values are giving way to secular values of political correctness and multiculturalism, and human rights have become a new sacredness. The second factor of transformation is the change in the ethnic composition of the most European countries as a result of large-scale migration. Associations of Islam followers provide significant influence in a number of European countries. This process leads to a kind of parallelism - new European Muslims create their models of legal, social, family and domestic relations, distancing themselves from the style of life of indigenous population. The third important factor is the worldview pluralism, which generates new religion- and belief communities, usually being a minority, according to the right of each person's choice of world-view in democratic societies. All these factors are closely linked to religious educational strategies of EU countries. The analysis of these factors and their consequences constitutes the actual content of modem European theoretical and empirical researches of religious Studies. The article deals with the most important areas, topics and problems of such research presented in the academic field of the new scientific community - the European Academy of religion.

DE precision-guided munitions; advanced conventional weapons; strategic
   balance; conventional arms control in Europe; confidence-building

AB The article analyses the new phenomenon, which emerged in the military-technical developments in recent years - the rapid progress in the precision-guided long-range weapons. This is taking place against the background of degradation of the arms control system and the deep overall crisis of the Russian-Western relations. The course for the abrogation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) is declared by the U.S. Administration, the cessation of the negotiations upon the "new edition" of the Treaty on the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) took place, the uncertainty exists as far the future of the Prague START is concerned. In this situation the new types of precision-guided long-range weapons are being designed and deployed by a number of countries. Technically this provides them with new military possibilities - i.e. striking through the entire territory of a potential opponent in case of the armed conflict. The authors detail the progress in the development of such weapons and assess the possible impact of various types of long-range precision-guided munitions on stability in Europe. Options are considered to provide exact definition of "long-range" for such systems in the context of the military-strategic balance on the continent. The perspective directions in development of these weapons are discussed in details, their interaction with the current arms control regime is assessed. The article discusses the destabilizing effect of such weapons and, in some cases, - the exaggerated assessment of this effect by the military-political communities of different countries. In view of the authors, the principle task in defining the control mechanisms applicable to these new assets is to prevent the possibility of a sudden large-scale air offensive operation with the wide use of precision-guided long-range weapons. The article proposes a set of measures in arms control designed to complicate and exclude such option. These measures may mainly contain the restrictions imposed on the locations of these assets and their platforms (airplanes), as well as the restrictions based on the zonal limitations - alike the philosophy used in the CFE Treaty. The military political conditions for imposing such control regime are being discussed.

DE Legal consciousness; legal idea; the rule of law; risk society
AB The purpose of the article is to analyze why the idea of the rule of law does not coincide with social and legal practice and what kind of deformations of the individual and public legal consciousness this engenders. Methods: The authors used systemic and dialectical approaches when identifying the indicators of legal consciousness deformation associated with the extremes of the absence or exaltation of the idea of the rule of law. Results: The authors identified cultural, political, socio-economic factors weakening the idea of the rule of law in a risk society. The peculiarity of the formation of legal consciousness in a risk society is that it experiences the influence of two groups of factors. The first is social instability caused by the consequences of globalization, technization, commercialization, the lag of legal regulation of risk from the avalanche-like spread and escalation of risks; the formal and relative nature of the differences in legal and illegal behavior. Conclusion: The identified factors limit the possibility of legal consciousness in the creative understanding of the legal order, which is an additional risk factor.

AB Modern science has at its disposal a number of philosophical and psychological theories devoted to the analysis of organization and self-organization, personal self-identification, inculturation, socialization, self-interpretation, and the identification of dominant features of the mentality of peoples. However, in cultural processes, the formation and development of the essence of the Russian mentality in sociocultural and natural dimensions are becoming most important today. Economics and linguistics are two areas of science that a person unites - acting and thinking (speaking). According to the definition of the famous English economist A. Marshall, the economy is "the doctrine of the normal functioning of humanity." The economy is fundamentally different from the exact and natural sciences in that it deals not with an individual, but with a member of society, subject to the influence of tradition, national mentality, and political institutions. The theoretical significance of the work is connected with the further development of the problem of the integration of sciences. The findings contribute to the expansion of existing ideas about the role of the economy in life and the language picture of the human world.

AB The article is dedicated to the study of the socio-political activities of A. Merkel on the eve of the reunification of Germany, its civic position and attitude to the GDR. The author characterizes it as a cautious opposition to the state system that existed in East Germany. On the one hand, A. Merkel made efforts to fit into the socialist system of the GDR, on the other hand, she moderately demonstrated her rejection, which consisted in the fact that she never crossed the red line and showed her disagreement with the regime in a safe manner The ability to balance is a feature that has become the basis of her political longevity. The article disputes the thesis, which is widespread in Russian and German studies, that A. Merkel entered the sociopolitical movement "Democratic Breakthrough" by accident. The author examines in detail her way from a scientist at the Academy of Sciences of the GDR to membership in "Democratic Breakthrough" and CDU party. Particular attention is paid to the role her father's environment and involvement into the Protestant community played in the ideological and political formation of A. Merkel. The main conclusion the author comes to is as follows: A. Merkel lacked the traditional tools for building a political career that West German leaders had. However, over time, she turned this flaw into an advantage.

DT Article
DE Arctic; maritime security; piracy; maritime terrorism; drug-trafficking
   by sea; international security; Arctic Coast Guard Forum
AB Transnational crimes committed in the maritime domain pose a real threat to international security today. Climate change and opening of shipping routes in the Arctic actualize the need to assess this type of security threats for the polar region. While the official Arctic strategies of the five coastal states - Russia, Canada, Denmark, Norway and the USA, - in general, acknowledge threats to maritime security stemming from non-state organized criminal actors, there is neither system-based understanding of these threats, differentiated approach to assessing specific types of potential maritime criminal activities, nor developing practical measures aimed at their prevention and suppression. Basing on the analysis of different maritime crimes, it seems reasonable to ascertain a generally low probability of their large-scale emergence in the Arctic in the nearest future. Main reasons for that are severe climate conditions, as well as economic and political stability of the region. However, the apparent and anticipated increase of Arctic shipping and development of new types of economic activities, such as tourism, can lead to increased risks related to transnational maritime criminal activity in the Arctic. In this regard, to date, the most real threat is posed by such crimes as terroristic attacks on cruise ships, illegal transportation of drugs and weapons using the main Arctic marine routes, illegal migration. It is obvious that the Arctic coastal states lack sufficient resources to efficiently address the threats related to transnational maritime crimes. In this context, special focus should be made on enhancing regional interstate cooperation in the field. Taking into account that the only regional mechanism responsible for enhancing coordination of national bodies regarding security-related issues is the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, it would be reasonable to endow this institution with the competence to develop joint measures for the suppression of potential maritime criminal activities in the Arctic. This could be made through development of a pan-Arctic legally binding agreement that would specify practical measures stipulated by other international agreements in the field of suppressing certain types of maritime crimes.

DE foreign policy; self-positioning; Turkey; Iran; Saudi Arabia; foreign
   policy identity
AB In the Middle East, the formation of nation-states has not been completed, and a search for foreign policy identity is still underway. The article examines the roots and evolution of foreign policy identity in three major Middle East states Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia. The authors analyze interaction between the national identities and foreign policy in different cultural contexts and under different political regimes. Turkey, which recalls its Ottoman past, is rapidly returning to the Middle East, challenging other players. Polls demonstrate that a growing share of the Turkish society is confident that Turkey can play an important role in the modern world, serve as a "model" for other states and act independently in the international arena. Tehran is actively pursuing a policy of regional expansion, relying on Shia communities and on its military might, which can eventually lead to a regional hegemony. This policy is based on several identities - revolutionary, pragmatist and pan-Iranian, which do not contradict and even complement each other. Saudi Arabia in the 21st century is positioning itself not only as a leader of the global Muslim, especially Sunni, community, but is also increasingly behaving as a hegemon of the Arab world countering the Iranian expansion. Despite all modernization efforts, the foreign policy identity of the Kingdom is strongly influenced by the tribal mentality of its ruling elite. The research demonstrates that in the Middle East states, foreign policy is strongly influenced by informal institutions - be it a western-type republic, a theocracy or an absolute monarchy. Hence customs, traditions, historical memory have a substantial impact on how the elites and general public envision the role of these countries and that of their rivals.

DE environmental non-governmental organizations; ecological modernization;

AB The article studies ecological modernization as a political practice of environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) in Russia and abroad. The attention is paid to the political behavior of ENGOs as political actors in the contemporary environment of globalization era. ENGOs are described within the framework of organization theory. Displaying their performance in the modern politics, the article focuses on the concept of ecological flows and the theory of Globalized Integrated Networks. It also raises the question of interrelations between ENGOs and population, civil society activists. In addition, the paper addresses environmental politics and policy-making problem in modern Russia. Being ecological modernization agents as well as world politics actors, ENGOs function in a brand new manner. However, much depends on their profile. One of the main differences between ENGOs is an attitude to ecological and conservation science. On the other hand, their routines are not always directly based on science. This is true even for "collaboratives" - the most outstanding actors in the contemporary political arena, playing a crucial part in ecological modernization. Values, beliefs, even personal tastes and preferences form the basis of decision-making here. This results in overestimation of the so called charismatic species and landscapes (their concept is presented here, too). The specifics of ENGOs, namely, a wide independence from a nation state and an unpredictable mode of behavior, combined with irrationality of decisions (sometimes imaginary) based on beliefs and wisdoms not obvious to others, makes them inconvenient to many participants of a political process, particularly to nation states and their institutes. Thus incapable to predict their activities and react correctly to their routines, governments make e f forts to neutralize them opposing their performance, but fail. This is true for Russia.

ID UNEMPLOYMENT
AB The socio-economic and political behavior of individuals is largely shaped by how they perceive the reality. These perceptions often differ from objective facts. This gives rise to perception errors that can significantly a f fect the economic and political environment. In modern societies, people worry the most about migration, unemployment, income inequality, etc. The paper analyzes misconceptions that arise around those issues: people tend to exaggerate the level of unemployment, the scale of migration, the degree of income differentiation. The authors conclude that it is possible to avoid some of those misconceptions. To do so, the authorities should provide citizens with reliable information about the most important socio-economic processes. Otherwise, perception errors can make individuals lose their sense of stability and security and decrease their level of lift satisfaction. These errors can also lead to growth in xenophobic mood, dissatisfaction with government actions, protests, and to an increase in support for radical right and left parties. In addition to that, the authors study the connection between subjective perception of reality and growing support for populism. the empirical analysis shows that the electoral support of populists in a number of European countries is due to the perceived scale of migration, rather than the actual one. Unreasonable fears associated with the influx of migrants, general dissatisfaction with lift, pessimism about the future largely provided support for the decision on Brexit, D. Trump's victory, M. Le Pen's exit in the second round of the presidential election in France and the formation of a right-left government coalition in Italy. The authors conclude that the shifts in voters' preferences are closely connected with people's subjective views on socio-economic phenomena. Worsening subjective social well-being of citizens can lead to changes in the political environment. Hence, to understand the processes that occur in modern society it is important to study subjective perceptions and how they are formed.

TI At the Dawn of the Cold War: F.M. Dostoevsky VS H. Arendt in the
   Question about the World Value of the Slavic Idea
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Dostoevsky; Arendt; Slavic idea; universality; totalitarianism
AB In order to pose the problem of identifying features of the design of the frame "totalitarianism", the article analyzes one of these cases, namely, how the authoritative philosopher Hannah Arendt used Dostoevsky's statements about the universality of the Slavic idea and views on the purpose of Russia in the changing world to prove Pan-Slavism as the source of totalitarianism in its Russian version, just like she called Pan-Germanism a source of Hitlerism. The present article compares the ideological techniques of Arendt and Karl Popper, since their works became the scientific rationale for fight against totalitarianism and, as a consequence, as a frame, against Russia. The analysis of this frame was conducted based on the comparison of the texts of Arendt's The Origins of Totalitarianism and Dostoevsky's essay "Pushkin". In his text, Dostoevsky uses the concept vsechelovek ("all-man") and gradually builds it out of the universality (universal significance) of Pushkin's poetry, the European history of Russia beginning with the reforms of Peter the Great, and finally destinations of Russia and the Slavic world in Europe. In her book, Arendt puts forward an artificial division into "historical" (England, France) and "non-historical" (Slavic) peoples, which actually proclaims the moral superiority of the former (Great French Revolution) as the desire for the liberation of humanity and love for it and gives a negative assessment of exactly the same trends in the pan-Slavic movement of the latter. The article reveals the causes for it, both political, i.e. making conditions fit an answer (Soviet totalitarianism is a product of Pan-Slavism), and technical, i.e. ignorance of the original text of the work and taking the phrase " all-man" from a secondary source. The authors made a conclusion about the typicality of the political and ideological conditionality of works of this kind based on a comparison of Arendt's The Origins of Totalitarianism and Popper's The Open Society and Its Enemies, which were used as one of the reliable, i.e. science-based, argument for dissolution of the USSR and one of the most important elements of the modern anti-Russian frame. Agreeing with D.V. Grishin's research work on The Diary of a Writer, the authors show that Dostoevsky's almost thirty-year-long struggle for Russia's place in the family of European nations is still relevant today. A return to the archetypes of first- and second-rank peoples in both the past and the present raises serious concerns due to the stability of the frame and the historical "experience" of using political recommendations built based on constructing theories.

DE power; state; state government; ruling elite; reference community; a
   network of the coalition
AB The article considers the grounds and consequences of the sustainable influence of reference groups of owners and controllers of large public resources on public decision-making. By giving a certain flexibility to hierarchical management structures, these communities - network by nature generate the effect of "intertwined" institutions, which under the informal pressure of such associations begin to consistently lose their civil functionality and transform the direction of political and administrative actions. At the same time, there are no proper administrative and legal tools to control these network raiders in the state apparatus. The sustained pressure of network associations on public institutions takes decision-making centers beyond the administrative apparatus; a space of "decision nodes" is formed that de facto controls the formation of the political agenda and the distribution and redistribution of public goods and resources in favor of the privileged groups of society. Ultimately, the functioning of "decision nodes" contributes to the formation of a special space of business communications, acting along with the official hierarchy and organizing the flow of redistribution of resources outside the official system of public administration (at times, even without authorized officials' participation). Unlike scholars who consider these practices a deviation and a temporary departure of the ruling elite out of control, the article argues that these processes mark the emergence of a new historical trend in the organization of public power, which does not need the administrative vertical and the supreme power. The network type of distribution of public resources is already turning a number of individual states into a separate structure protected from society, a kind of "Noah's Ark" for a narrow group of beneficiaries who control "decision nodes" and use them as tools for the distribution of public goods and resources in their favor. In fact, this means not only the destruction of public norms and institutions, but also the gradual disintegration of the state itself as a special territorial form of communication between the authorities and the population that supports social order.

AB Introduction. The relevance of the study is due to the need to effectively support the process of nation-building which implies coping with social and political tasks that are fundamental for the Russian state and the population of the country. This is the completion of the formation of the Russian nation, ensuring civil, ethno-cultural, and territorial identities, taking into account their balanced and harmonious coexistence and development, preservation and strengthening of national identity in the adverse conditions of global, regional and internal trends and challenges. The purpose of the study is to conceptualize the state policy of nation-building in modern Russia and to identify its content, institutions and mechanisms of formation and implementation by means of interpreting expert assessments and the practice of the responsible bodies in the structure of the federal government.
   Materials and Methods. The study is based on the materials of an expert survey on the issues of nation-building, on the data from the official websites of the relevant committees of the State Duma and the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, as well as from the System for ensuring legislative activity. The analysis of the activities of parliamentary committees was performed using institutional, comparative, and the formal legal methods.
   Results. The authors have proposed a variant of the conceptualization of the state policy of nation-building through creating a hierarchy of factors of nation-building, highlighting its key areas, methods and technologies, explaining the specifics of the nonnative consolidation, the structure and the implementation mechanisms. In terms of the inventory, codification and demonstration of the issue, the status-role characteristics of the_ parliamentary institutions involved in the nation-building process have been identified and emphasized.
   Discussion and Conclusion. The results of the study have theoretical and practical significance. The systemic idea of the essence and content of the state policy of nation-building has been formulated and substantiated. The main areas of concern, the established constants, and new vectors in the activities of the relevant committees and in the relations between the federal bodies of legislative and executive power have been revealed. The results of the study can be used to improve their work in various areas of the public policy focused on . promoting nation-building, expanding and deepening the dialogue between the authorities and non-governmental institutions.

AB The article contains an analysis of economic and trade relations between the North African countries and the Russian Federation in the late 20th - early 21st century. For a long time these relations have been under influence of the Cold War. This influence displays itself in the body and structure of business connections which - with certain countries - used to consist largely of military-tech cooperation, but contributed little to any investment projects. In the early 2000s, the partner-countries started to look for new, innovative forms of business cooperation which would correspond to their national interests, the spirit of time and the calls of the 21st century. By 2017, Russia and the North African states which had put great efforts in a complex environment (economic crisis on the cusp of the 20th and 21st centuries, difficulties of economic reforming, change of economic bodies, review of legal basis governing foreign trade relations, etc.), managed to turn the tide and achieve significant positive results - the structure of exports of goods and services has transformed, the volumes of bilateral trade have increased, the legal basis for business cooperation has developed, investment activity has also slightly increased. However, several major problems still await response, a number of projects have failed to launch. The forecast for development of Russia's trade and economic ties to the North African countries is based upon both analysis of what has been achieved and evaluation of priority fields of cooperation which have large resources and a potential for further growth. These fields include exploration surveys, acquisition of gas, petroleum, uranium and bauxite assets, construction of power assets - hydroelectric and nuclear power plants, building of railroads, opening of Russian trade houses for promotion and servicing of the Russian machinery-tech products, participation of Russian companies in privatization of industrial assets. Implementation of these plans is related to the economic growth in the partner-countries, focus on carving cooperation out of destructive influence of a dynamic political environment.

DE university rankings; higher education; international students; BRICS
AB Responding to globalization, Russian universities become increasingly entangled in local, national, and international relations. World rankings, such as the Academic Ranking of World Universities, QS World University Rankings, and THE World University Rankings, lay emphasis on the status and prestige of universities as well as on the quality of education and research they provide. One of the key criteria in their assessment is the percentage of international students, which encourages universities to seek ways to attract more foreign students if they want to move up the rankings. The article discusses the case of the Ural Federal University (Yekaterinburg, Russia): in 2017-18, the authors surveyed undergraduate Chinese students (n = 20) and Russian experts specializing in the university's promotion on the global education market (n = 4). The survey results have shown that international students do not consider a university's position in rankings to be an important factor in the choice of an education trajectory and that they are much more oriented towards word of mouth recommendations from their friends and relatives as well as the perceived quality of education. Education is generally seen as a ladder for upward social mobility and is expected to improve the students' career prospects in their home country. Experts believe, however, that, in the years to come, rankings will be playing an increasingly important role in students' choices. They also pointed out that universities resort to both formal and informal practices to rise up in the rankings. Progress in rankings may become an end in itself but can also serve as a part of a more general marketing strategy to attract investment and improve the university's standing on the educational market.

ID THINKING
AB In the introduction part of the article, the authors prove the topicality of the issue, set the aim and formulate the problem of the research. According to the research in the field of the methodology and theory of thinking, a special place here is given to reflexive activity associated with the reflection of the main ways of life and human existence. The questions of reflection are studied in various subject areas. Today, some of the results of these studies are used from the perspective of the competence-based approach implemented in the modern education system. If conditions for a continuous improvement of education are observed, the determination of the philosophical and methodological foundations of the relationship between reflection and creativity becomes relevant, which makes it possible to expand the scope of ideas about the results of the educational process formed in the Russian science and outline the best ways for a successful modernization of education. The main thesis that the authors formulate is that the nature of creativity from the perspective of thinking stems from the specifics of the mechanisms of reflection. The authors determine the interrelation of reflection and creativity through the tradition of reflexive analysis of consciousness which clarifies ideal meanings and is associated with the construction of ideal objects and through the tradition of understanding which clarifies meanings that manifest themselves in communication. Important is the fact that in the tradition of reflection, along with the objective interpretation of thinking and the study of thinking as oneself, attention focuses on the meaningful activity of consciousness. This activity is fixed in the formation and identification of ideal images and meanings related to categories of mind. Creativity is dependent on how the world is perceived, on the knowledge of ideal images in any field which are formed through reflection, since self-association of consciousness with another consciousness, with the previous and future states of consciousness and action is achieved. It is the comparison of an ideal image with real-life images realized in daily activities that allow forming a unique new result of thinking that corresponds to the spirit of the time. Creativity is not an ideal image, rather a deviation from it. In the tradition of understanding, the main focus is on the variability, the variability of the meaning interwoven into the acts of communication, including the linguistic one. Expansion of meanings and content as a result of interpretation contribute to the creation of the world in our heads. This world is woven from millions of images, thoughts, including patterns that ae not always ready-made, and popular models. A world in which there is no resistance to reality has no concepts of time and space. All meanings of an abstract world exist forever, do not grow old, do not leave us unless we want it. Going beyond the patterns of thinking allows identifying the conceivable ideas of the past and the future that determine the infinity of knowledge. The phenomenon of creativity is closely intertwined with the mechanisms of reflection as an ability of natural thinking, at the stage between subject and abstract thinking. In conclusion, the authors identify the following philosophical and methodological foundations of the relationship between creativity and reflection.
   Firstly, in content, it is the duality of reflexive processes which lead to a shift in ideal images and are associated with the construction of ideal objects, on the one hand, and the variability, changeability of the meaning included in the acts of communication, including the linguistic one, on the other. And here the phenomenon of creativity is intertwined with the mechanisms of reflection as an ability of natural thinking - at the stage between subject and abstract thinking. Secondly, in form, it is a practical activity related to solving problems for which traditional methods and means do not work. From the standpoint of the result of this activity, reproducibility as a rational reconstructibility in the reflexive picture is admissible: obtaining new knowledge, a new vision proceeding from the old one. Non-reproducibility that involves the creation of a new, previously non-existent result of mental activity is also possible.

AB The article presents the results of research on the officially declared construction of the Indo-Pacific region (IndoPacific). Centered around the purpose of the study (identification of the transregional structure), characteristics of historical strategies applied at different times in the basins of three oceans (Atlantic, Pacific and Indian) are drawn, a possible design is schematized, the "connectedness" construct is tested. In the course of a comparative analysis of oceanic complexes, the relief of interference space is described on the basis of the Monsoon Asia countries; its post-Soviet (the political model of Central Asia) and Russian segments (Monsoon regions of the Arctic zone) are revealed. The geographic and political discourse highlights the motives that define the functions of the projected international region. It is proved that as part of the simulation of Indo-Pacific (the global version of the Middle East territorial complex) an iterative approach reflecting the modern ideas of its designers, concerning the development environment of a "world superpower", is used. The key moments of the conceptual impact of H. Mackinder's, A. Mahan's, N. Spykman's and F. Turner's theories of the West as a space of North American leadership are noted - in particular, the Turner's "Pacific Century" of the United States, the Mahan's provision on the emerging threat in the "Asian Mediterranean", etc. Relevant similarities between modern methods of risk prevention and recommendations found in the works of the British and North American scientists are made. The applied aspect of the connection strategy, motives and functions of the projected international region are highlighted. Given the need to understand the essence of the process, the definition of a geostrategic region is proposed for the first time, assumptions of its functional role under conditions of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (with its paradox of technologies outstripping human ideas) are made.

AB This article is a continuation of the study of the epistemological features of the concept of proof in the context of a type-theoretic approach. The previous article was devoted to epistemology of computer program correctness proofs. It addressed the problems of surveyability of this type of proof, the question of their social role. In turn, this article focuses on the use of various computer tools to prove theorems. The article considers the brute force proofs, briefly examines the general structure of the proof of the four color theorem as proposed by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken. The most interesting comment about the four color theorem was made by Thomas Tymoczko. His argument concerns the notion of surveyability of proof, and one of the central points is the doubts about the concepts of theorem and proof. According to Tymoczko, the use of computers in obtaining mathematical results leads to the introduction of experimental methods in mathematics. Otto Bradley Bassler emphasizes the concept of an intermediate step and the idea of continuity of thinking in Francis Bacon, Rene Descartes and John Locke. According to Bassler, it is reasonable to distinguish between local and global surveyability. The Appel-Haken proof of the four color theorem is globally observable, but not locally observable. It should be noted that not every mathematician checks absolutely all mathematical results in the process of learning and further work. Proof verification is a social process. If even potential local surveyability cannot be guaranteed, then conviction of the proof is akin to believing in inductive generalizations. The mathematician believes in the correctness of the work of the computer, and this belief turns out to be justified in the spirit of reliabilism. The researcher is convinced of the reliability of the computer. However, this conviction is very complex. Paul Teller expresses an alternative point of view regarding the surveyability of proof. According to Teller, the surveyability of proof constitutes human mathematics, but not mathematics in general. Edwin Coleman expresses a close idea. He points out that practically any proof, if we demand full explication and proof of all intermediate results, will be so long that it will completely go beyond the limits of surveyability. Proofs are surveyable only insofar as they are part of the written archive of mathematical results and rely on the set of intermediate lemmas and theorems that are also included in the "World Mathematical Archive".

AB Between 1907 and 1911, Imperial Austria experienced two major controversies concerning entanglements of science and religion. In 1907, the Innsbruck specialist in church law, Ludwig Wahrmund, publicly criticized the new 'antimodernist' and antiscientific trends of Catholic science, causing semester-long protests, fights, university closures and heated parliamentary debates. Antagonized in Innsbruck, Wahrmund relocated to Prague. The controversy triggered by his work, however, united students from across the monarchy in Wahrmund's defence. In 1910, an analogous conflict arose in Cracow after Kazimierz Zimmermann was appointed professor of Catholic sociology. This time the protest against his teachings, although intensive, transgressed Galician boundaries only to a limited extent, failing to mobilize progressive student groups to go on the streets outside of the province. This article analyses the difference between protests against Wahrmund and Zimmermann from a spatial perspective. The author argues that the way both conflicts were received in politics and in local university cities indicates that there was an Imperial Austrian public sphere that transgressed national boundaries and linguistic divisions. Conflicts over contested topics, like the long-heated relationship between Church, science and higher education, were charged events that brought this public sphere to the fore. This translingual, imperial public sphere remained, however, hierarchically structured. A conflict in Innsbruck had more weight than one in Cracow, both within political discussions and in local presses.

AB By the end of the second decade of the 21st century, due to domestic and international developments, Russia and the West entered a state of tensions and a new cycle of the arms race - unprecedented since the worst times of the Cold War. Both sides got into this phase of relationship under the new world order, with advanced military technologies and under the rule of a new generation of political leaders. The turning point of these dangerous trends came with the decision of the United States to withdraw from the INF Treaty and high probability of the expiration of the New START without its extension or substitution by a follow-on treaty after 2021. Hence, the U.S. and Russia are on the verge of a new large-scale and uncontrolled nuclear arms race, which will be aggravated by the rivalry in offensive and defensive conventional strategic and medium range systems, as well as space weapons and means of cyber warfare. In combination with the development and deployment of short-flight-time ballistic and hypersonic systems as well as introduction of low-yield strategic and tactical nuclear arms for "limited" and "tailored" nuclear attacks this would drastically lower nuclear use threshold and increase incentives for preventive or preemptive nuclear strikes. In addition, the arms race will be multilateral, involving, beside the U.S. and Russia, China and many other nations. This would undercut the norms and regimes of nuclear non-proliferation, security and safety of nuclear materials, technologies and sites, which sooner or later would provide international terrorism with the access to nuclear weapons - with all the ensuing consequences. This article is dedicated to the above dangers and still remaining possibilities of averting them. In particular, if the two sides agreed on the new intrusive verification procedures, the INF Treaty still could be saved. Likewise, extension of the New START might stabilize strategic relations for another five years after its expiration in 2021. During those years or, still better, during two years remaining till 2021, a follow-on treaty could be negotiated to reduce strategic arms ceilings and envelop advanced destabilizing nuclear and conventional weapons.

AB The article reviews the implementation of the perspective planning in the USSR during the period of the New Economic Policy - NEP, from methodological discussions to the development of five-year plans - sectoral and for the entire national economy. The article analyzes the discussion of the proposal of the first five-year plan submitted by S. Strumilin at the congress of planning bodies in March, 1927. It is shown that the sharp criticism of this plan for being imbalanced by the leading economists of the country, in particular, V. Bazarov and N. Kondratiev, is valid. The author points out the influence of political factors on the planning process. The popular cliche that the forced industrialization in the five-year plan was necessary to prepare for the war is refuted.

AB The latest US administration's moves in the Middle East have been perceived by the European political class with embarrassment and open criticism. The US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran announced by President Donald Trump (May 2018) as well as the American troops pullout from Syria, announced in December 2018 have been met with criticism in Europe. It is likely to be the first case in the post-WWII era that the heads of the leading European states as well as the EU high-ranked officials publicly declined to follow the line in the Middle East demanded by the US administration. Moreover, they proceeded to develop measures to neutralize the negative impact of Trump's policy. Against this backdrop the Europeans faced an urgent need to elaborate and implement their more independent approach to the crisis situations in the Middle East, foremost with regard to the problems of Syria and Iran.

TI Deformation of a Person's Legal Consciousness Under Bringing Discredit

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

DT Article
DE discredit; legal consciousness; deformation of legal consciousness;
   determinants; discredited legal consciousness
AB The authors of the article observe determinants of an emergence and expansion of bringing discredit upon the government in Russia, determine their influence on the deformation of a person, establish the degree of their impact on legal convictions of a person and the level of a person's legal consciousness. The study is based on a systematic and comprehensive approach in order to investigate the problem from the perspective of different sciences: jurisprudence, political science, psychology, pedagogics, sociology, philosophy. Works of outstanding Russian and foreign researchers, official information from the website of the President of the Russian Federation, the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation were used in the study. The methodological basis for the study of bringing discredit upon the government and deformation of legal consciousness is composed of a dialectical method, general patterns of emergence, establishment and development of the state and legal phenomena, principles of comprehensiveness and historicism and general scientific methods of logical cognition (analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, determination, classification and comparison, analogy and generalisation). When providing rationalization for the relevance of the topic, the authors admit that bringing discredit upon the authority in Russia takes the lead in the state and society, it demands focused attention and a prompt response by the public and authorities. Legal consciousness is relevant for the Russian government and society; it promotes the legal culture of citizens, allows to secure social consciousness and statehood. In order to establish the relationship between bringing discredit and a person's legal consciousness, to determine the influence of discredit on deformations of legal consciousness, determinants of emergence and expansion of bringing discredit upon the authority in Russia were observed. Determinants (political, religious, cultural, socio-economic) were identified which have a significant impact on the legal consciousness of the citizens. A conclusion was made that these determinants adversely affect citizens' consciousness and promote deformations. In order to establish the level of legal reality distortion and the displays of deformations of a person's legal consciousness under bringing discredit upon the authority, the deformations of legal consciousness and their main forms. The authors classified legal consciousness deformations and defined discredited legal consciousness as an independent type of deformation. In addition, the authors described all forms of deformed legal consciousness and evaluated the impact of subjective and objective factors on the formation of deviations in an individual attitude towards law. The authors conclude that there is an influence of bringing discredit upon the government on deformations in legal consciousness; they propose a definition of discredited legal consciousness and reveal its features.

AB Civil and political activism is not a monolithic, "one-size-fits-all" phenomenon. It is rather viewed as nationally unique, segmented political attempts to engage different groups of citizens into a civil movement. The paper explores the specifics and effectiveness of some types of Russian civil and political activism-female, youth, unofficial, religious. Based on a political marketing communications framework, the author argues that paradoxical specifics of civil and political activism in Russia tend to avoid political slogans, demands as well as content, adhering to the principle of neutrality which is the main idea fn the contemporary Russian domestic policy. Despite the pronounced demand for activism and changes, people are unready to fight and revolt. Russians are not under a universal crisis of values and goals, which usually spurs negative political activism. Various analytical surveys, reports and official documents compiled by Russian official agencies and think-tanks in 2010-2018, support the author's arguments.

AB The author admits that the laws of science represent a distinctive feature of the contemporary type of science which developed through classical, non-classical and post-non-classical stages. This article is the first attempt in Russian and foreign epistemology to give a comparative analysis of distinctive features of science laws for these stages. The empirical material of the article is investigations of the contemporary type of science law made by scientists (such as Isaac Newton, Rene Descartes, Ernst Mach, Albert Einstein, Arthur Eddington, Ilya Prigogine, and others) and by those who analyse science laws from a philosophical position (such as Auguste Comte, Alexander Koyre, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Karl Popper). The results of the study are the following. Classical science comes to a recognition of the law's priority meaning in a scientific research, which acquires features of a universal, immutable and natural relation between observable phenomena in their static and dynamic aspects, and which possesses a foresight function. Laws of non-classical science relate with different aspects of subjectivity. Einstein gave a new meaning to static and dynamic laws; he introduced the concept of a structural law. Based on thermodynamics, Eddington discovered the time's arrow; when making a distinction between primary and secondary laws, he came to recognise the historical character of laws. The distinctive features of post-non-classical science laws can be verbalised as historical and genetic laws. This type of laws relates to the idea of internal time opposite to the idea of external time, the latter being the foundation of classical and non-classical science. Internal time as an "average age of a state" of any system transforms it into a historical structure, so laws tell us how a system occurs and what its sources are as well as how and into what it will transform. The historical and genetic character of post-non-classical science laws is directly opposite to the structural laws of non-classical science, like the internal is opposite to the external.

TI FEMINIZATION OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION: A SOCIOCULTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE
   GENDER EVOLUTION OF EDUCATIONAL WORK IN GERMANY

DE social history; history of teacher education; gender inequality;
   feminization of teaching profession; teacher education in Germany;
   women's rights
AB Historically, the teaching profession was pretty much a man's one in all cultures due to the universal traditional restriction of women's social status. However, between the 18th and the 19th centuries some girl schools appeared in the region; they gave girls not only general education, but also a governess or elementary teacher profession. The aim of the article is to determine the specificity of the gender evolution of the teaching profession in Germany that started in the beginning of the 19th century and significantly lagged behind in comparison with other developed countries. By analyzing various sources (like statistical reports, legislative acts of single German lands reflecting the organization of education in the 19th and 20th centuries, scientific studies, periodical press, memoirs and some fiction), the author sought to identify the leading factors and reasons which pushed girls to the teaching profession, to characterize the social status of German female teachers during the two centuries, to determine the dynamics of educational policy transformations caused by a complex set of conditions and contradictions in the German society. The basis of the study of teacher's work feminization was a sociocultural approach to present the process as a German educational phenomenon. The statistical method allowed to analyze quantitative data on the progressive increase of female teachers and staff transformations during some periods of political and economic changes. With the help of the system-functional method, the content of measures taken by the regional authorities in different periods to promote or counter the feminization of the teaching profession was studied. General scientific methods of analysis, comparison and generalization allowed to make scientific conclusions on the topic. As a result, it was determined that the gender image of the German teacher began to change from the beginning of the 19th century: more and more women appeared in the teaching profession, both nuns and laywomen. Women chose to become teachers under pressure from financial circumstances and public opinion, according to which educational work was considered as the only acceptable one for unmarried women from bourgeois families in conformity with the traditional understanding of women's social role. It is revealed that feminization of the teaching profession also caused development of vocational education for women. The study proves that such opportunities were created by the specifics of the economic and political situation in the country in separate periods of the 18th and 19th centuries. During two world wars and economic crises, women were dislodging men in the labor market, but the authorities opposed these processes for a long time and legislatively prevented the popularization of the teacher's profession for women. Poor financial situation of unmarried women, however, forced them to accept restrictive measures, and the number of female teachers was slowly increasing. Gender professional discrimination persisted until the 1950s both in the hiring of female teachers and in the organization of teacher education; and the study proved that it objectively could not be overcome earlier.

DE posthuman; morphological freedom; recognition; gender; sex; queer;
   gender binary
AB The article engages with consequences that the currently proliferating practice of reinvention of gender-sexual identities has for the normative order of society. An emerged posthuman era is featured by "morphological freedom" (A. Sandberg, et al.) conceived as a civil right of a person to modify their own body on their own terms. As a consequence, we can observe a major normative morphogenesis in the domain of the gender binary system. The longstanding cultural assumption that male-female dualities are "natural and immutable" is now rejected as a socially constructed system of patriarchy and male privilege in pre-modern and modern societies. The increasing number of transgender and transsexual passings around the world, as a part of a much wider phenomenon of visceral transmobility, challenges primordial ascriptive heteronormativity. In this context, of sociological interest is the question of how current normative morphogenesis is embedded into the socio-normative order, or whether there are any restrictions and barriers to prevent the dismantling of ascriptive constraints in the posthuman society. The proposed idea is that normative morphogenesis in the domain of ascriptive gender status allocation is accompanied with consistent maintenance of heteronormativity in a deeper sex assignment system. Although there are many countries worldwide (from Nepal to Canada) that have recently recognized non-binary sexual statuses allowing individuals to legally assign 'third' sex, reluctance to recognize sexual transmobility on a mundane sexual level, as well as on the level of unconscious intentions, and institutional medical and legal activities, continues to keep on. Based on secondary analysis of relevant surveys' data, case-studies, evo-devo ideas, psychoanalysis, the main inference of the article is about the rigidness of morphotaxis (as opposite to morphogenesis), a latent mechanism functioning to preserve the primordial social order by the way of persistent reproduction of heteronormativity. Elaborating on Axel Honneth's theory of the "struggle for recognition", it is concluded that the structures of "non-recognition" reproduced in the process of normative morphotaxis still matter and will not be eliminated by emerging opportunities of "morphological freedom", but will ever find ways to contain transmobility in the domain of the gender-sexual normative system for the sake of the survival of the humankind, which is possible on the evolutionary foundation of sexual binary only.

DE parliamentarism; Parliament; executive branch; parliamentary functions
AB An analysis of the evolution of parliamentarism shows that the institution is historical in nature, and is in constant development. Its evolution, transition from one stage to another, is caused by the political, socio-economic, cultural and spiritual changes in the society. Features of the implementation of parliamentarism in various periods of the political system development reflect the state of social relations and meet the requirements of society. This institution, having realized its historical potential at a certain stage, creates preconditions for a transition to a qualitatively different state that is characterized by new content and institutionalization forms. The experience of parliaments over the past decade shows that the institution has not outlived its usefulness, and it is unlikely that it will ever become unnecessary. The strength and importance of parliamentarism lies in its ability to provide an evolutionary way of society's development. As practice in the developed countries shows, in crucial moments of history, parliament and related institutions and practices played the important stabilizing role in these countries. Modernization processes received people's approval and support, including through parliament, because parliament gave these processes the nature of the implementation of the will of the people. Parliament creates the conditions and provides the opportunity to hear all the opinions, contributes to the achievement of compromise and rapprochement between various political forces, makes laws, creates the legal basis of the state. This institution involves the population in the discussion and decision-making either directly or through political parties and alternative methods of representation. Such mechanisms allow parliament to share the responsibility for the decisions and the electorate in some degree, and to legitimize political power. At the present stage, the parliamentary system faces several challenges that hamper its development. This article attempts to analyze the specifics of modern Russian parliamentarism and to identify factors hindering the development of its democratic version, and also offers measures to overcome the existing problems.

DE civic culture; social communication; political meanings
AB This article addresses the concept of a civic culture as a form of social communication. The notion of culture is constructed with reliance on a communicative approach. Culture is studied in the framework of the above approach through an exchange of meanings between individuals, which is achieved by the use of a language as a form of conveying meanings to enable other individuals to perceive them. A civic culture represents a form of political culture which is most favorably combined with a democratic political system. It is presented herein as a configuration of three constituent elements, namely, a basic political meaning (other meanings could be added thereto to produce specific features of a given political system), civic competence (which is taken to mean exposure to political meanings encountered in society and ability to utilize them to facilitate discussion), as well as a high intensity of information flows in public spaces (which results in acquisition of political meanings and language). The two latter elements can be referred to as basic element stabilizers both in the short and in the long run, respectively. The article proceeds to trace the structural component of a civic culture in three time periods. In the Antiquity, it was formed in democratic city-states such as Athens in which the agora (a central meeting space) served as a platform for shaping common experiences, and civic competence was required from all individuals with access to ecclesia (the municipal assembly). In the modern period marked by an absolute majority of representative democracies, the role of the agora belonged to mass media and civil society institutions, while civic competence was required more from social leaders and somewhat less from other citizens. Lastly, the postmodern period is marked by tendencies jeopardizing the existence of a civic culture at national levels. Such tendencies are globalization, an ever-increasing role of the Internet, emerging network society, and expanding individualism. The author concludes that the structure of social communication is changing in response to the above tendencies, which entails a need for an alternate approach to view effective communication (according to a civic culture type and, perhaps, on a level of area-based settlements).

AB The 1905 Revolution was often considered by workers writing memoirs as the most important event in their lives. This paper examines biographical reminiscences of the political participation of working-class militants in the 1905 Revolution. I scrutinize four tropes used by working-class writers to describe their life stories narrated around their political identity. These are: (1) overcoming misery and destitution, (2) autodidacticism, (3) political initiation, and (4) feeling of belonging to the community of equals. All four demonstrate that the militant self cannot be understood in separation from the life context of the mobilized workers. Participation in party politics was an important factor modifying the life course of workers in the direction resonating with their aspirations and longings. The argument is informed by analysis of over a hundred of biographical testimonies written by militants from various political parties in different political circumstances.

DE conceptualization; simplicity; synergy; complexity; philosophy
AB In the article, the problems of a conceptual understanding of complexity are discussed. The concept of complexity is a general one; it is actively used in daily life, in the framework of general scientific and philosophical traditions, yet its subject and meaning remain hidden. Reflections on complexity include a variety of discourses suggesting that the concept has a general scientific and philosophical character. Currently, the concept "complexity" does not have a universal definition, and different perceptions of complexity (including mutually exclusive) organically coexist in the minds of philosophers and scientists. The dominance of the aggregative approach to complexity prevents its consistent interpretation. Modern literature does not clarify the diversity of existing definitions of complexity and its variations. In general scientific dictionaries, complexity is defined either by using absolute quantitative characteristics, or regarded as a secondary consequence of simplicity. Estimations of complexity are relative, and relate to the disciplinary area, cognitive scale and nature of objects under study. The article highlights aspects of complexity, problems of its definition that encompass objective and subjective features of complexity. The author offers a typology of approaches to complexity including reductionist and holistic options for its interpretation.

DE neurophenomenology; subjectivity; embodied consciousness; difficult
   problem of consciousness
AB Neurophenomenology is one of the programs of cognitive science. The history of the onset of neurophenomenology and its difference in cognitive neurophenomenology (Francisco Varela) and cultural neurophenomenology (Charles Laughlin) are briefly reviewed. The peculiarity of cognitive neurophenomenology is that, within its framework, phenomenology and experimental cognitive science are considered as complementary ways of investigating the nature of consciousness and subjectivity, and their connection with the brain and body. The aim of this article is to analyse the study of the fundamental problem of subjectivity in unity with its biological and physical grounds in Varela's neurophenomenological concept. The fundamental problem of subjectivity is presented as a problem of understanding the emergence of living subjectivity in a living being, including the mutual formation of a living being through living subjectivity. The neurophenomenological aspect of the study of consciousness allows representing the relationship of experience and bodily self as a basis for understanding consciousness, and the concept of embodied consciousness as a way of solving the difficult problem of consciousness. The problem of the relationship between the physical system of an individual and their subjective properties is topical for modern cognitive science because, within the framework of functional and neuro-reductionist consciousness, consciousness as a field of subjective experience is eliminated in the process of explanation. In Varela's terms, the connection between the objective and subjective spheres cannot be studied without consciousness. Consciousness is a real object of study for Varela; therefore, the phenomenal properties of consciousness must be taken into account in the explanatory theory. The problem of constituting an autonomous consciousness and revealing the way it exists is connected with biological and cognitive aspects since consciousness can simultaneously be a non-localized virtual point and provide an identity regime that allows for the interaction of consciousness and the world.

   Algeria; Tunisia; Egypt; Libya; Maghreb; social development; education

AB The article analyzes dynamics of basic factors of a modernization process in North Africa. The main driving forces transforming the region's economic and political systems are identified. The complex interaction of socio-economic, ethno-linguistic, confessional and tribal-originfactors in transformation processes of North African societies is examined. The influence of a terrorist threat and separatist sentiments on socio-political development of the region is evaluated. The reasons impeding/slowing down modernization processes in North Africa are highlighted. These are:1) bureaucratic barriers to reform (especially in Algeria); 2) growth of the instability zone in the region (primarily Libya); 3) weak development of legislation to stimulate foreign investment; 4) inter-country contradictions on key political issues (in particular, on the settlement of the Western Sahara problem, the conflict between Algeria and Morocco caused by the status of border areas). Among factors that stimulate modernization processes in North Africa are: 1) gradual integration into the global economy; 2) activity of young people more susceptible to modernization policy; 3) internal political consensus on the need for modernization; 4) involvement of ethnic and tribal groups in the social life of the countries of the region. The political evolution in North Africa is influenced by some issues - the differences in economic and sociocultural development, migration flows, the impact of the European Union states. EU leaders are beginning to realize the need to curb refugee flows from the Southern Mediterranean and, therefore, the importance of political stabilization in this region. Modernization processes in North Africa region have their own characteristics (and, accordingly, difficulties) associated, inter alia, with ethno-confessional problems. A positive solution to these problems depends not only on North African authorities and societies themselves, but also on some European countries, the former metropolitan states (primarily France), which still retain some influence in the region. In addition, successful modernization is important not solely for North African countries. Being a kind of bridge between Africa and Europe, they have a strategic impact on solving problems of the entire African continent, not merely economic, but also such as growth of the terrorist threat belt, uncontrolled arms trafficking, the movement of illegal migration flows to Europe, drug trafficking, etc.

DE Great Britain; Brexit; EU; right-wing populist parties; Ukip
AB The article is about growth of unexpected popularity of the British populist right-wing party - the UK Independence party (Ukip) and its role in the success of the idea of a UK exit from the EU (Brexit) at the British referendum on June 23, 2016. The author answers the question why in comparison with the rest of European countries the right-wing parties were not popular and successful in Great Britain in the 20th century but at the beginning of the 21st century one of these british parties has suddenly gained broad popularity and played an important pole in the outcomes of the referendum. There is a definition what parties can be called populist. There is also information about what a phenomenon of "insular psychology" is and how it prevents the British from supporting populist right- and left-wing parties. Scrutinizing key milestones of economic and political steps of different UK governments -from M. Thatcher's governments to the Cameron-Clegg coalition government - the author highlights the interconnection between social fragmentation, marginalization of British society, the loss of its self-identification and the increasing popularity of the Ukip ideas of Brexit. The reasons are also given why Ukip has managed to persuade the major part of British society to vote for Brexit. Several of them are: the discontent of people with the UK active participation in the EU integration and the overwhelming flow of migrants from other European countries; the memory of Great Britain's imperial history and the persistent high level of national identity which are the main source of right-wing populism and nationalism in the country; the consumerism of the main Britain's political parties which has lead to the loss of their ability to transmit the needs and wishes of different social strata in the House of Commons; the resentment of people over the government austerity policy and the lack of confidence among the British to the expert and governmenal recipes for resolving of economic problems. The study examines two Ukip electoral manifestos and its pre-referendum campaign.

DE public finance management; strategic expenditure reviews; budget
   preparation; comprehensive and selective expenditure reviews; baseline
   budget expenditures
AB The article focuses on key characteristic features of spending reviews in the OECD countries and formation o f institutional environment allowing for introduction of such reviews in the Russian Federation. Spending reviews have been applied as an element of project and program appraisal and evaluation in several OECD countries since 1980-s. Their limited nature at that time could be proved by the fact that they were mainly used only when governments faced severe budget deficits. After the global financial crisis (2007-2008) the situation has drastically changed: spending reviews evolved into an independent instrument of public finance management. The new approach assumes application of spending reviews both for identification of inefficient budget/ program expenditures and reallocation of freed financial resources in line with medium-term policy priorities. In the recent years, a set of principles has been developed and implemented in several OECD countries thus creating enabling environment for the further expansion of spending reviews in countries with different level of economic development and structure of budget systems. Based on the examination of spending reviews' record in OECD countries, the authors discusses pre-requisites to be put in place in order to launch spending reviews in Russia, including changes in the legal base and integration of spending budget preparation process. Changes in several resolutions of the RF Government and orders of the RF Ministry of Finance are required. The role of the RF Ministry of Finance in organization and overall management of the process of spending reviews' planning and preparation should increase. Also, one of the Commissions in the RF Government should assume responsibilities to conduct oversight and approve general directions of spending reviews, since political support is critical for the final success in implementation of this financial instrument in Russia.

AB Image culture is a humanitarian concept that is in the stage of its conceptualization, integrated in the thesauruses of such sciences as philosophy, pedagogy, psychology, ethics, aesthetics, sociology, economics and, finally, culturology.
   At present, taking into account the "explosive" processes of the digital age, globalization, the multiple complication of the axiological picture of the world, etc., the practical and theoretical necessity of scientific analytics, technological elaboration, methodological generalization, verification of the phenomenon of image culture (passed, in the author's opinion, the framework of professional culture and acquired features of universality and scale), as well as the conceptualization of a similar concept has arisen. Irresponsible, massive exploitation of Western scientific schools, theories and technologies without proper adaptation to the Russian mentality, to Russian activities in general, have led to the fact that currently the concept "image culture" is far from ideal, and the very concept of "image" needs rehabilitation.
   The author defines the image culture as a formatting direction of social culture that reflects the multifaceted socio-psychological characteristics of the individual and society (in different scales: micro-, meso- and macro-, local, regional, national, subregional, etc.), integrates specific structural components (the person himself and / or society as a subject and object of image culture, specific activities for its formation, objectification and disobjectification, as well as the substantive results of this activity: the image, image, status, prestige, etc.) possesses a multilevel set of qualities: axiological, social, professional, political, worldview, etc., related to the ability to live in a multicultural society, dialogic interaction, being sense of purpose, constructive communication and self-improvement.
   The article gives a cultural analysis of image culture as a conceptualization and sense-filling of a personality and / or social group aimed at development and self-development, projecting the future, building individual and collective meaningful orientations.
   The image culture is conceptualized by the author through a systems and structural-functional approach through gender-species relations with social, professional, economic and marketing cultures, and also as an independent system whose structural elements are different-sized sets of notions like "image", "appearance", "brand", "status", "prestige", "authority", etc. The article gives a detailed correlation analysis on these structural elements of "image culture", as well as the specific characteristics of its functions.

DE CIAM; IV Congress; Moscow
AB The publication highlights the little-studied topic of the failed intentions to hold the IV CIAM Congress in Moscow. The text is based on an analysis of documents from Russian archives and refers to events related to the preparation for the Congress of the Soviet side. The article reconstructs the process of organizing the forum, highlights the chronological stages and main actors on each of them, and reveals the decision-making mechanism. A special attention is paid to the debatable problem of the reasons for refusing to hold the Congress in Moscow.
   According to the archival documents, key decisions in the process of preparing the Congress were taken by the highest political authority of the USSR, i. e. the Politburo of the Central Committee of the AUCP (b). The article states that the adoption of a decision was determined solely by the interests of the state authorities and had no relation to creative problems and discussions within the professional architectural circles.
   In the chronological boundaries of preparation for the Congress (autumn 1929-spring 1933), several key stages are identified. At the stage of negotiations with CIAM on the holding of the next congress in Moscow (autumn 1929-autumn 1930), the interest of the Soviet side was determined by interest in the Western experience of urban planning and mass housing construction and the possibility of its application in the USSR. At this stage, initiators of the Congress and main practical actors were concentrated in institutions that led the Soviet housing co-operation. At the next stage (October 1931 October 1932), the role of the leading actor passed to the Soviet state represented by high-ranking officials, who had their own idea of the tasks and form of holding the Congress. The government considered the forum from the point of view of the propaganda representation of the USSR on the international arena and the possibility of visualizing the achievements of the socialist transformation of the country. Such a representation contradicted the nature and practice of Congresses of CIAM. The inability to become the main beneficiary of propaganda gains led to a loss of interest in the Congress by the supreme state power. At the final stage (November 1932-spring 1933), the defining role was played by a professional architectural community that was oriented towards international exchange of experience and cooperation, despite creative differences. The Congress was prepared on the basis of the Union of Soviet Architects and the architectural section of the All-Union Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries (VOKS).
   Thus, in the preparation of the IV Congress of CIAM in Moscow, various actors with their own interests collided. The priorities of state power came into conflict with the interests of the professional community, and this conflict was resolved in favor of the state. The decision on the actual abolition of the CIAM.ongress in Moscow, taken by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the AUCP (b) In March 1933, was predetermined by the discrepancy between goals, principles, and procedure of the event and the interests of political power; this decision was only reinforced by the tense economic and social situation within the USSR at the turn of the first and second Five-year Plans.

AB The article deals with the EU's activities regulating social networks, especially Facebook, and their impact on the upcoming elections to the European Parliament. Having analysed the European Parliament's reaction on manipulation of Facebook users' personal information by Cambridge Analytica, the author reveals serious MEP's concerns of the election results, which can significantly change the balance in the European Parliament. The article also explores new tools for regulating activities of Internet companies and political parties on the eve of the elections. Emphasizing the growing influence of social networks on political processes, including pre-election ones, the author comes to the conclusion on the danger of overestimating the role of social media to the detriment of the real problems, which mostly determine the election results.

AB This paper is compiled as an analytical review of proceedings of the similarly-named Conference which took place on May 17, \2018 in the V.I. Rudomino All-Russian State Library for Foreign Literature. The Conference was confined to the 70th anniversary of the State of Israel, though a substantial part of reports was dealing with the very complex, if not to say enigmatic, problem of freedom and lack of freedom in the current global history including that of Russia. Different participants of the Conference (politologists, historians, philosophers, theologians, etc.) displayed their solidarity accepting three basic principles of the phenomenon of freedom and its contemporary dimensions: the principle of mutual correlation between different thus complementary trends and imperatives of human thought and human practice; the principle of Law overgrowing the sphere of particular juridical formulae and regulations; the principle of historicism presupposing not only the succession of institutions and ideas, but also an unique character of socio-cultural and political manifestations of human life. The complex dialectics of continuity and discreteness seems to be one of the key conditions of the freedom issue in its contemporary dimensions including political ones. The paper also deals with some specific religious and intellectual issues of Western, Russian and Israeli history, as well as with those of the present-day non-Western areas.

DE concept of fate; determinism; convergent technologies; human
AB The paper is focused on the conceptual transformations in the interpretation of the concept "fate" in the technogenic culture. In philosophic studies, the concept "fate" is primarily considered in the historical and philosophic aspects. In antiquity, in which the cosmos defines being, the idea of fate was one of the basics in terms of understanding human being. In medieval culture, the idea of fate, as divine providence, retained its importance. In modern times, with the development of natural science and the formation of a scientific worldview, the idea of fate was dislodged into the sphere of philistine ideas. The interest of philosophy in the notion of fate was revived in existentialism, though not in a rationalist, but in an irrationalist context. In the rationalist philosophic tradition, the idea of fate is constituted in the context of the cultural dominant of determinism. Georg Simmel understood fate as the determination of human life by external forces. In Oswald Spengler's works, fate is the inner logic of life, its deep regularity. In this study, along with historical and philosophic analysis, it is shown that the prospect of studying the ontological essence of technology, outlined by Martin Heidegger, at the present stage of the development of science and society finds its embodiment in the phenomenon of technoscience. Heidegger revealed the essence of technology through the concept "Gestell" and stressed that "Gestell is fate because it sends man to revealing historical being". If the phenomenon of fate is viewed in the evolutionary context and interpreted as a kind of a development program, it should be recognized that biology, genetics, and technology science have influenced the conceptual content of this universal of culture. Particular attention is paid to the problem of human development and the preservation of human identity in the conditions of technological expansion. Convergent technologies are able to change radically both people and their world. These fears found expression in the idea of a technological singularity articulated by John Von Neumann. The biological component of human nature was the unchanging foundation upon which the evolution of man was built. The possibility of changing the very foundation creates a qualitatively new situation. Is there a choice for a particular person: how to construct one's self if irreversible biological programs are launched? The prospect of conceptualizing a deterministic attitude and discussing the philosophic problem of determinism and free will is outlined. It is shown that the analysis of deterministic attitudes of human development strategies and civilization is associated with such concepts as "prognostic practice" and "foresight".

DE evolutionary epistemology; Karl Popper; memes; word as virus; World 3
AB The problem field of evolutionary epistemology looks as follows: on the one hand, one cannot refuse the evolutionary metaphor that is fundamental for the theory; on the other, two ways of using this metaphor give us with the following dilemma: either an objective study of knowledge in the form of records, or a study of any methods of knowledge transfer without the possibility of dealing with knowledge itself. Thus, we must retain the metaphorical relation to the evolutionary theory while changing the way the relation is founded. It is common knowledge that viruses are subject to all laws of evolution: they change, replicate and undergo natural selection. We speak about virological epistemology in order to bring into focus its underlying metaphorical shift, namely, knowledge is a virus. It is this affirmation that gives rise to virological epistemology taking it out from the problem field other concepts are in. To legitimate this metaphor, there must exist certain similarities between knowledge and a virus, and it is these similarities that appear as the fundamental principles of virological epistemology. Four of these principles were determined by two thinkers, Terrence Deacon, a linguist and neurophysiologist, and William Burroughs, a writer and experimentalist. This was done, however, in relation to language rather than knowledge. Burroughs is the author of the famous statement that "the word is a virus". According to him, the similarity between them is that language, like a virus, depends on the carrier (speaker) to be propagated through infection. Deacon draws an analogy between language as a system and a virus as an extracellular parasite to highlight co-evolution between language and the human brain. Therefore, for Deacon, the grounds for transfer is the fact that language "evolves spontaneously", with no control by its speakers, i.e. represents a self-developing system. This system has all the features of a network: no explicit dominant centers, consequently, no hierarchy. Thus and so, Burroughs highlights the distributive properties special to each individual system component, while Deacon focuses on the system properties. Transition from one to the other is realized via propagation: in such a way, a virus invades a plurality of carriers to build an infection network. Therefore, in total, we have five attributes to characterize both language and a virus, namely, dependence on the carrier (speaker), infection, propagation, network nature and self-ogranization.

AB This article is devoted to the life, political views and activities of Le Figaro correspondent Rene Marchand (1888-1962). Marchand became widely known in Soviet Russia thanks to his open letter to French President Raymond Poincare in 1918, which criticized the republic's policy vis-a-vis Moscow as well as acts of sabotage by the Allies. The missive became an important episode in the confrontation between the Entente's special services and the young Bolshevik regime. French and Russian historians tend to argue that the French journalist's sympathies turned to socialism and Bolshevism in 1918. However, they generally pay little attention the French Left in Soviet Russia. Based on research in French diplomatic and military archives at Courneuve and Vincennes, respectively, the author concludes that Rene Marchand was a multi-faceted individual and the nature of his sympathies to the Bolsheviks remains questionable.

DE epistemological fields; discourse; fact; metaphor; interpretation
AB Discourse transformation as a consequence of new epistemological fields formation is analyzed in this article. The process of discourse structuring from the historical perspective is analyzed on the basis of a historical investigation of a sign and its interpretation represented by Umberto Eco in his work "Dall'albero al labirinto. Studi storici sul segno e l' interpretazione". The process is studied in the context of linguistic and extra linguistic realities correlation. Also, the influence of a dynamic object on the formation of new knowledge is analyzed: cognitive schemes, limited by the society's practice, are developed by discovering unknown aspects of reality, and give new interpretations to the known facts. A metaphor, being one of the factors of new knowledge creation used by a cognizer in different types of discourse, is connected with this process. Among the other issues, the dynamic object, as well as permanent discourse transformation, raises the problem of knowledge falsification that occurs as a consequence of new epistemological fields formation. From the point of view of epistemology, this process is interactive, and may be considered a result of a constant cognizer's interaction with the world. The role of a metaphor in this case is difficult to overestimate. As a metaphor is a tool for creating some new knowledge, it hides the mechanism of its usage from a cognizer. A metaphor gives unusual meanings to the extra linguistic reality; these meanings bring new senses, relations, directions and so on. Metaphor functioning shows that this speech pattern is a compulsory part of semiosis. The object of the research is the reasons and grounds of new epistemological fields formation. The authors suppose that these fields condition discourse transformation.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE historical science; scientific reflection; perception; ideology;
   politicization
AB The article discusses the perception of Soviet historiography in the post-Soviet period. Transformations of Russian society in the early 1990s raised the question of continuity in the relations of Soviet and post-Soviet science. The socio-political transformations associated with forced democratization caused the need to reassess a number of phenomena, which created a situation of internal contradiction in historical science. The conclusions of Soviet historical science on a number of scientific problems were, in fact, declared false, and its approaches unproductive, the scientific value of works published in the Soviet period was often carefully leveled or denied entirely by post-Soviet historians. A closed ideological framework is perceived as a constant in Soviet historical research. Control of party-state bodies over historical science is defined as "pervasive". The leitmotif in the description of works devoted to political history is an indication of their generalizing and superficial nature, schematism, fragmentation, repetition of theoretical positions of the Marxist-Leninist concept of history, and minimal novelty. The result of the "reappraisal of values" in historical science was an entire denial of positions of Soviet historiography. In the perception of historians themselves, history in the Soviet period was a "servant of an ideology". Liberal democracy did not have an apparatus of coercion like Marxism-Leninism had, but it continued to "write history" dictating new ideological guidelines to scholars, which made them critically approach the work of their predecessors. This can hardly be explained by the assumption that historical science got used to be ideologized and that history "seeks" an ideology for itself Being part of reality, ideology also becomes part of research describing it, which should not be perceived as its flaw. The very fact that ideology had an impact on science in the USSR and the harmful consequences of this impact cannot be denied, but the total ideologization of Soviet historical science today is seen as a cultural myth generated by the Soviet epoch and perceived by the next one. However, this cultural myth had a great methodological importance for historical science. Using the experience of predecessors, post-Soviet historians aspired to objectivity, refused to obviously politicize research, tried to fill the gaps that formed as a result of the ideological vacuum, which became a significant stimulus for the development of science in the transition period.

DE the New Man; the New Woman; Bolshevik Design; Early Soviet Society
AB The article examines theoretical preconditions, as well as the political and ideological priorities of Bolshevik efforts to engineer of the "New Man" in the early Soviet period. The author shows the Marxist origins of the Bolshevik project and their transformation in the works of V.I. Lenin and other leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet state. It describes the principal mechanisms and tools used to design the New Man, as well as practice of social mobilization and exposure to the political culture of Bolshevism. Emphasis is given to the role of the legacy of World War I in the Bolshevik institutionalization of social engineering, coercion and violence to create new human material. The article also shows disagreements among the Bolshevik leadership during the period from 1917 until the late 1920s regarding the ways of designing the New Man in the context of the proletarian culture, the role of the moral character concept for an ideal communist person as the builder of new society. Analysis is given to the gender aspect of the problem, the Bolshevik vision of the ways to design the New Woman and reshape the old way of life. The article traces the transformation of the Bolshevik leadership's vision of the New Man and the New Woman throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The author singles out two stages in the Bolshevik engineering of the New Man in the early Soviet period (1917 - mid-1920s, late 1920s - mid-1930s), and describes the project's evolution.

AB The article deals with the problems of mass migration of young people from the rural areas on the example of Altai Krai as the largest agricultural region in Siberia. Various assessments of these processes are identified, and the necessity of their regulation due to emerging risks and threats at the national level is justified. The methodological features of the study include a comprehensive approach to the measurement of the social status and activities of rural youth on the basis of a differentiated and comparative analysis of their changes, as well as the assessment of impact of rural social regulators and state policy on youth migration. The results are based on a number of regional sociological studies and statistics. The characteristics of migration processes in Russia and their specificity in Altai Krai since the early 1990s are given. It is concluded that the long-term migration decline of the population in the region can lead to the depopulation of the rural areas and the loss of social control over them, to the deterioration of age and educational structures of the population, as well as to the reduction of demographic resources for sustainable regional development. The dynamics of actual and potential migration of rural youth is described. Since the beginning of the latest crisis, there has been an increase in potential migration. In 2017 more than half of the young people planned to leave the rural areas. The groups of young people with higher migration potential are identified. The practices of the migration behavior of rural youth and their consequences are considered. Among the latter are the following: almost one and a half times reduction in the number of rural youth, hindered reproduction of population and labor resources in peripheral areas and small villages, the aggravation of the lack of skilled workers. It is shown that the scale of pendulum and seasonal migrations has increased significantly due to the development of the road transport network, Internet and mobile communication. The positive results of the impact of re-emigration on the improvement of the educational structure and the structure of employment of rural youth are revealed. Along with traditional drivers and barriers of rural youth migration, new ones are considered. The reasons of strengthening of influence of family-related networks as catalysts of migration are revealed. The modern practices and effects of rural business and public policy on the reduction of youth migration are shown. The slow reaction to the degradation in the rural social development and the lack of attention to the living conditions of the youth in villages are highlighted among the defects of the state policy. The authors proposed ways of increasing the efficiency of the state policy to reduce the migration of rural youth, taking into account the priority of the spatial development of rural areas and the influence of social regulators.

DE party system; Russia; party change; elections; functions of parties
AB The year 2019 will be significant for the Russian party system. Firstly, nearly 30 years ago, Article 6 of the USSR Constitution was abolished, which formally created the basis for the modern Russian multi-party system. Secondly, 2019 is the termination time for the seven-year period set for new political parties, formed on the basis of changes in the Law on Political Parties of 2012, to become active political actors. In this connection, there is a need to evaluate the past period, to answer the interrelated questions: What is the state of the Russian party system? What is its configuration? Will it be affected by the elimination of some parties? Though political parties had existed in Russia before, the formation of the modern party system was part of the import of institutions. The work and role in society of Western political parties of that time were undergoing dramatic changes, which could not but tell on the Russian parties. Given this, the state of the Russian parties is analyzed in the context of the world trends of "party change", their model in the semantic space of Russian politics, and the alignment of parties' political forces. Particular attention is paid to the potential of the staff and features of the Russian parties' work at the regional level because it is a criterion for assessing parties' activities and for forming electoral preferences for the majority of citizens. In addition, internal processes in the Russian parties, especially in those formed after 2012, are most noticeable at the regional level. The structural dynamics of the Russian political parties was divided into three periods according to the analysis mentioned above: (1) years 1991-2001, (2) years 2001-2012, (3) year 2012 and on. It is remarkable that the reduction in quantitative requirements increased the number of organizations registered but did not influence the structure of major political parties. The survey of the role of political parties in the social and political life in Russia has proved the conclusions of foreign political experts about the following functions of political parties: (1) persisting functions; (2) formally persisting functions with a changed content; 3) functions abandoned by parties in modern time and never performed in the post-Soviet Russia. In conclusion, a four-level pyramid-type model of the Russian party system is introduced together with the forecast of its stability for the nearest future under the probability of dramatic outer changes.

DE environmental policy; eco-innovation; university cities; campuses
AB It is shown that countries, regions, cities, corporations and universities are actively developing their environmental policies. This is facilitated by modern innovative technologies, such as alternative energy, energy-saving equipment, new motor vehicles, processing of wastes into useful goods, and many more. Countries have to adapt to the global climate change, which is accelerating at an unprecedented speed. One of the most sensitive places in terms of global warming is Siberia. This territory as a unique natural mega-construction largely regulates the carbon cycle and the climate of the planet. Environmental policy is on the agenda in almost all countries of the world, but in some countries, such as France, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, it is given priority. Russia began to develop an environmental policy on its territory. As known, Russia made 2017 the year of ecology. Environmental friendliness is incorporated into the engineering and infrastructure solutions of a number of new cities. The most striking examples of such cities are the eco-cities of Songdo and Masdar. The cities are provided with solar energy, have a pneumatic system of waste collection, have mostly electric public transport. Traditional cities are also shifting to new ways of saving energy and creating a clean infrastructure. In the world, there has been a mass policy of transition to the design of offices based on environmental principles. Such giants of the hi-tech industry as Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, etc. set fashion in this area. Russia has a rating "Green Offices in Russia". Three criteria are analyzed: non-toxicity, energy efficiency and low carbon living. The most active in the ranking of 2017 were representatives of the IT industry.
   The world's leading universities are actively implementing the environmental component in their development along with educational programs and research projects. The concept of a green university involves the use of environmental innovation in the university. Innovations include landscaping, organization of a separate waste collection system, energy efficiency. Campuses have park areas, water bodies, buildings with "zero heat emission", and more. Students of such universities participate in projects and actions, are engaged in research and project work, make business plans taking into account environmental protection. Taking into account that green universities actively cooperate with municipal, city and regional management structures and business partners, this can ensure the improvement and green development of their district, city and region as a whole.

AB The political activities and attitudes of the priest N. Gepetsky during his work as a member of the III State Duma of the Russian Empire are discussed. Attention is paid to Gepetsky's position on a number of issues discussed in the Duma, including the question of the address of gratitude to the Emperor, the fight against drunkenness, the development of primary education, the rights of non-Orthodox religions, the language of teaching in Bessarabia primary schools. Special attention is paid to Gepetsky's efforts to unite politically the Duma clergy, his struggle for the independence of the parish school, speeches and articles of the deputy- priest, in which he presented himself as a Russian nationalist. The relevance of the study is due to the growing public interest in the problem of relations between the Church and the state, acute discussions about the role of religion in education, the problem of the relationship between Christianity and nationalism. Novelty of research consists in that it is the first work specifically devoted to N. Gepetsky. It for the first time provides an analysis of his political views, new sources are introduced in the scientific circulation, including Gepetsky's articles in the press, archival documents, reflecting his career in the Church and activity in the Duma.

AB The objective of the research is to analyze modern historians' views on developing and functioning of the collective-farm system in the post-war 20-year period. The task was to reveal main directions of the analysis, the topic degree of knowledge and research prospects, as well as factors influencing the opinion of scholars, similarities and differences in their assessments and conclusions, polemical judgments. At the Soviet stage of historiography, the objective reflection of the development of the collective farm system in the years of post-war Stalinism and the Khrushehev decade was hampered by the need to take into account the doctrinal and political attitudes of power and the restrictions on access to archival materials. The nihilistic assessments of the Soviet agrarian system made during the Perestroika period became the methodological foundation for post-Soviet studies. The author concentrated on studying the life and work of the peasantry in collective farms, machine-tractor stations and state farms, which are mainly portrayed as a mechanism to oppress the rural population and its number reduction. Farming was considered as an alternative to collective farms. Since the late 1990s ideas on the collective farm and state farm system as a "prison" for the peasantry began to be diluted by the conclusions that it was a special social-economic phenomenon, a means (albeit imperfect) of modernizing agriculture. A number of objective factors contributed to the revival of interest to the history of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, state farms, and private subsidiary farms of the population, in particular the dominance of small-scale production of agricultural products over large organizational-production forms. Farms, for which the reformers of the early 1990s laid so many hopes, played a secondary role in agrarian production. Most authors, who believe that the collective farm and state farm system was a peculiar means of agrarian modernization, devote their work to the history of the collective farms. Their publications attempted to reveal new facets of old scientific problems, to answer the questions that were posed, but not fully disclosed in the Soviet era. Various aspects of the activity of machine-tractor stations, state farms, and personal subsidiary farms of the population are analyzed as well. The modern historiography of developing the collective farm system includes works, which search new methodological approaches to analyze the country's agrarian system within the framework of modernization theory in broad problem-chronological frames.

ID EXPERIENCE
AB The article analyzes the concept of relative deprivation as a factor of socio-political instability in the course of the Arab Spring events using the methods of correlation and multiple regression analysis. Relative deprivation is operationalized through such an indicator as subjective feeling of happiness, based on the assumption that a person in a state of relative deprivation cannot feel subjectively happy. It is shown that the change in the level of subjective feeling of happiness between 2009 and 2010 is a powerful statistically significant predictor of the level of destabilization in the Arab countries in 2011. The next most powerful predictor is the average value of the subjective feeling of happiness in the corresponding country for 2010. At the same time, the fundamental economic indicators we tested while controlling for them, have turned out to be extremely weak and at the same time statistically insignificant predictors of the level of socio-political instability in the Arab countries in 2011.

DE outer space; space aims; anti-satellite systems; spacecraft; satellites;
   space debris; ballistic missile defense; partially orbital bombardment

AB The subject of the prevention of arms race in the outer space is not new, but remains important for strategic stability and international security. The laws of space dynamics and its physical properties harshly limit its use, in particular the introduction of space-based weapon systems. This is exactly the reason why up to now all spacecraft of military or dual purpose are performing only information-command support of armed forces in traditional land, sea and air environments, as well as of ballistic missiles and anti-missiles which transit space as part of their trajectories. Nonetheless, a number of states are developing and testing anti-satellite systems of various basing modes. Hence, in the foreseeable future, the outer space may turn into the environment of arms race and use of force, prone with the growing threat of aimed conflicts, their fast escalation to nuclear war, and of the collapse of aims control regimes. In 2008, at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, Russia and China proposed a joint draft of the "Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects". This draft has been met by the approval of the international community, except for the United States and its allies. Nonetheless, this draft treaty will hardly become a legal agreement, even Y . the U.S. attitude towards the subject changes in a positive way, since the draft has a number of substantive deficiencies and omissions. Apparently, if space arms control is ever to become a matter of practical negotiations, this would be a long and phased process reminiscent of the strategic arms limitation and reduction (to which space systems are technically closest), rather than a single overwhelming treaty as chemical or biological conventions. Despite all the complexities of the issue, in a better political environment, a first step might be feasible in the form of an agreement on the prohibition on testing anti-satellite systems of any basing mode against real space objects. If such a partial first step were made - it may pave the way to the follow-on treaties with broader and more stringent provisions and intrusive verification, as happened in the history of U.S. - Soviet/Russian strategic arms control after the first SALT-1 agreements of 1972.

AB After the October Revolution, those peoples who did not agree with revolutionary changes decided to go into emigration, and among those were North Caucasian refugees. This article aims to describe the vectors of migration taken by North Caucasian refugees in the 1920s and 1930s, using private and public archives in France. Two main vectors were Eastern and European. In the 19th century, those who did not agree with the Russian authorities in the North Caucasus moved to the Ottoman Empire, whereas those who went Europe settled in Bulgaria, Serbia, and Germany. There were various political or social benefits from Czechoslovakia and Poland, and so many migrants from the North Caucasus ended up in these countries as well. A study of resettlement of North Caucasian migrants in Paris and its suburbs reveals four key principles of residence in the French capital: 1. Some accommodations were near places where migrants worked. 2. Migrants with money could live in prestigious areas (the 16th arrondissement). 3. Accommodations among other North Caucasian diaspora (the 15th arrondissement) led to the creation of a kind of resettlement the North Caucasians in Paris. 4. Accommodations were available in the Paris suburbs.

DT Article
DE social ontology; public opinion polls; atomic individualism; survey
   technology; sociopolitical role of polls; electoral ontology; election
   procedure
AB The article analyzes the reasons for the low degree of problematization of ontological assumptions in public opinion research. The development of sociological is characterized with constant discussions about the relationship between individual and society. At the same time, in fact, atomic individualism remains the only ontology underlying public opinion polls. The author proposes a hypothesis that this situation is coherently influenced by two factors - technological and socio-political. Their concerted and unidirectional impact could lead to the absolute dominance of the image of the ontological ground of public opinion as a set of atomized individuals. Among the technological factors, the author mentions the localization of research objects in space and time, the consideration of individuals as isolated units of observation and the mediated access to respondents through usage of formalized tools that leads to the analytical unification of public opinion bearers. All these features of the mass survey are explained by the saving of resources and the simplification of the data collection system, that is, they are purely technical. But at the conceptual level, they lead to the fact that the carriers of public opinion are considered as identical, isolated, relatively stable and indivisible units. Factors of the social role are manifested through linking the practice of polls to the election procedure. In its framework, individuals are also considered as the identical (one person - one vote), isolated (each vote himself, anonymously), indivisible (one can't divide the vote), stable (one can't change the choice after the vote) units. Thus, the influence of two factors coincides in all considered aspects.

There is the roll-message in Cracow Chartorysky Library (Perg. 2822/IX), which has been sent to the emperor with their legates. It became known among contemporaries in Poland and Lithuania. The authors of the article strive to analyze the manuscript tradition of the roll. The differences between its Moscow ambassadorial, Lithuanian Russian, Polish and Latin copies show that the roll took part in the political struggle of the period.

DT Article
DE Kalmyks; Republic of Kalmykia; Kalmyk diaspora; U.S. Kalmyk diaspora;
   cultural space; space; cultural ties; confessional identity; ethnic
   identity; Buddhism; symbols
AB The article analyzes the cultural space defined by different Kalmyk-inhabited territories with a special insight into the life of the U.S. Kalmyk community. It outlines the multi-level ties between Kalmyk-inhabited territories within their common cultural space determined by specific historical destinies of the ethnicity. In the "Iron Curtain" period, any such ties were dramatically dependent upon the misfortunes of history. The illegal act of forced deportation of the Kalmyk population to the Eastern regions of the USSR 'tore apart' this cultural space as it scattered the ethnicity itself. Ties with the cultural space manifested themselves only in somewhat persistent historical memory about the 'mother ethnicity' cultivated by American Kalmyks, and in their attempts to facilitate the restoration of Kalmykia's autonomy that would once again reinforce these mutual ties. When the autonomy was reestablished, some cultural contacts were reinstalled, even though the cultural space remained closed off.
   The contemporary period (from the 1900s onwards) is a time when the cultural space expanded, enriched through the use of Internet technologies. The article also examines the cultural space of the Kalmyk diaspora in terms of certain unifying and distinguishing factors which set up a link between confessional and ethnic identities. The author also sheds light on current processes facilitating the development of an integrated cultural and confessional space, and factors contributing to these developments. Interpreting the newly emerged social conditions and information technologies, the article also analyzes some of the symbols accepted by the U.S. Kalmyk diaspora.
   Sources for the study include scholarly publications, Internet resources, media articles, as well as the author's field observations during her 2012 stay with the U.S. Kalmyk diaspora and the active epistolary exchange since then.

AB An attempt is made to reveal the key elements of the discourse of ethnic diversity management in Russian pre-revolutionary social thought. Numerous texts published by representatives of various sociopolitical views (Westerners, Slavophiles, liberals, conservatives, populists and socialists) devoted to the description and assessment of the policy of the Russian government in relation to national regions in the period under review are analyzed. The study was conducted on the basis of the analysis of mainly English-language scientific literature. Poland was chosen as a model region, that is, the main attention in the article is focused on the Polish question. The choice of this national outskirts is due to the following: on the one hand, it compelled the most close attention of representatives of the Russian pre-revolutionary social movement, and on the other, this territory was the place of testing of various incorporation practices by the Russian government. The study showed that, despite different political views and ideological platforms, Russian intellectuals clearly defined the intentions of the authorities, which consisted in the gradual integration of the periphery into the common imperial space, first on the administrative-legal, and then the cultural field. It is shown that the undulating nature of this process was absolutely opportunistic.

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to the origins, grounds and possible consequences of the political crisis in modern Italy. The paper shows that the Italian crisis has acquired a scale that challenges the interests of political establishment of the country and the very principles of the EU existence. Methods and materials. The authors seek a combination of General theoretical and special methods, focusing on the historical, socio-cultural and political analysis. They are based on the analysis of periodicals, as well as using articles and materials of researchers on the problems of political development in Italy. Analysis. The source of the crisis is the protest of citizens against the state authority and strategies of the political class of Italy, which is accompanied by the requirement of institutional reforms and socio-economic policy for benefit of the majority, in order to establish new political rules and form a truly legitimate political mechanism. These demands came from various social groups and led to a number of political and legal transformations, culminating in the "populist government", which came to power as a result of the parliamentary elections of 2018. The "Populist government" intended to revise many previous approaches in domestic and foreign policy. It is the Alliance of the right-wing and left-wing populists that was entrusted by Italian society with necessary reforms. Results. According to the authors, it is political populism as a possible platform for social and political transformations, along with a number of possible risks, that contains a positive potential associated with the possibility of overcoming ideological divisions, corporate selfishness of Italian politicians and parties, as well as alienation in the relations of the power and society. This approach to resolving issues by the "populist government" will contribute to the gradual resolution of the problems that have caused the long-term political crisis in Italy.

AB The article focuses on the premises of Bruno Latour's project of creation of a new form of collectivity in which human and non-human actors can participate equally. An adequate incorporation of the nonhuman actors in the process of communication is made possible by their "official representation" by the scientific community. The mission of the scientific community consists in creating "apparatuses of articulation" in order to establish an appropriate interaction with the human actors. A successful realization of this project would lead to a rejection of the paradigm of the modern that is based on the dualism of the object and the subject, the world of things and social realty. In its turn, this rejection motivates the development of networks that determine the conditions that make democracy possible. Democracy will be founded by a new collective of human and nonhuman actors. The development of this project is complicated by the global obscurantist elites opposed to the overcoming of the ecological, epidemical and social crises in the era of Anthropocene. For this reason, the article analyzes the impact of Latour's early project of a critical sociology of science on the development of climatic skepticism aimed at discrediting scientific institutions and thus complicating the relations between them and political elites. An overcoming of this crisis should be built on the political philosophy of the French republicanism and a sociology of science that would allow for a renewed political ecology. The new political ecology must provide theoretical grounds for a new social contract within the global collective.

   Lurie; Ancient Egypt; papyri; social-political formation
AB The article presents previously unknown work by V. V. Struve "Objections and additions to S. Ya. Lurie's report "Social revolution" in Egypt". A cornerstone of Struve's work is justifying that some of papyri sources, namely the Leiden papyrus No.344 and Hermitage papyrus No.1116 B recto were reflections of social revolution in Egypt. This opinion was opposed to the point of view of S. Ya. Lurie who believed that these papyri reflected descriptions of popular festivals. In 1923, Lurie presented his paper "Social revolution in Egypt", presumably in the Palestinian society, challenging a number of experts on these sources. V. V. Struve considered that Lurie had misinterpreted the papyri. The work published below is the earliest evidence of the existence of the concept of social revolution in the Ancient East. The report by S. Ya. Lurie still has not been discovered, however references to it and to a broader context within which Struve's work was being prepared give grounds to suggest that this idea was widespread in the Russian historiography already in the second half of the 1910s. The concept of "social revolution" was one of the foundations on which the idea of transition from one social-political formation to another as a result of revolution was formulated, as well as the idea about typological unity of these processes for all societies of antiquity. The article contributes to the biography of V. V. Struve, and sheds more light on the history of formation of the categories of the Soviet historical science.

DE cameralism; Russian economic thought of XVIII century; Moscow State
   University; Russian economic education; evolution of economic thought
AB The main purpose of this article is to investigate the impact of European cameralism on the development of Russian economic science and education in the 18th century. Cameralism as a Science of the State or Science of Regulation was a response to the profound political changes provoked by the Thirty Years War and Peace of Westphalia as well as by the process of secularization. Young national states developed the idea of civil and economic regulation as a main source of its power and sovereignty. This new political strategy demanded a new type of economic knowledge - applied, pragmatic, and practical-oriented. As a result, new cameral sciences demonstrated few distinctive features: the emphasis on collecting data of national economy, the practical focus of research, the methodological and disciplinary eclectics as well as the growth of the publicity of academic activity. Thus, the investigation of the Russian economic thought and education of 18th century is aimed to discover common features with European cameral tendencies. In this period, "economy" designated the practical application of any scientific knowledge in order to rationalize the economic life of the state. As a result, natural sciences played the notable role in the development of economic science. The structure of the courses of Moscow University from 1755 to 1804 did show that economic disciplines are represented at all three faculties, - Philosophy, Law and Medicine. Even after the department of political economy was established in 1804, this disciplinary disunity tended to persist.

DE Lyon; French Revolution; federalist revolt; Jacobins; Girondins; siege
AB This article considers the inner life of the city of Lyon during its siege by the Jacobin troops. On May 29, 1793. the radicals who were in power in the city were overthrown by moderate figures. Shortly thereafter, this caused a conflict with the Convention, which the Girondists were expelled from at the time. The Paris authorities declared Lyon counter-revolutionary and moved troops to it. The siege lasted from August 8 to October 7, 1793, after which the city surrendered, and repression began.
   The study mostly refers to protocols of the work of various authorities in Lyon: the People's Republican Committee of Public Safety, the municipality, and the revolutionary committees of certain sections. Additionally, the author refers to press materials, memoirs, and reports made by the enemy, using methods of comparative historical analysis and content analysis.
   The author aims to recreate the realities of everyday life in Lyon during the siege period in order to further try and define the political forces that came to power in the city on May 29, 1793. The study demonstrates that the Lyon orders of the time very much resembled the orders in Jacobin Paris. Although the May 29 coup took place under the slogans of protecting private property and people's homes and lives from the attacks of the radicals. the circumstances of the siege forced the new authorities to resort to the same extreme methods which the city had just rebelled against. The life of besieged Lyon is an unusual attempt to balance between the observation of human rights and the typical practices of the military revolutionary time.

DE European Union; Japan; EU-Japan relations; East Asia; "normative powers"
AB This article is devoted to the role of Japan as a "strategic partner" of the EU in East Asia. The article analyzes evolution of the Japan's role in the EU's policy towards East Asia, compares the scope of cooperation between the EU and its three main partners in the region - China, Japan and South Korea. The author comes to the conclusion that the main partner in the region for the EU is China, although there are considerable divergences between them in the area of political norms and values. The position of the EU appears to be ambivalent: putting consolidation of norms and rules among the third countries as a key element of its foreign policy, in East Asia the EU relies not on the like-minded partner, which is deemed to be Japan, but on the most economically powerful partner, thus preferring economic interests to the idealistic ones. Japan, which, along with the EU, is called "nonnative power", appears to be on the sideline of the EU's priorities in the region and is equaled in significance with South Korea as a "natural political partner". Such a choice seems to be rational, but puts under question the liberal-idealistic self-identification of the EU as a "nonnative power".

DT Article
DE Ostsee Region; Russian Empire; senatorial revision; N. A. Manasein
AB This article considers the policies of the Russian Empire in the provinces of the Ostsee region in the early 1880s, namely the experience of a senatorial inspection of Livonia and Kurland provinces by N. A. Manasein. The purpose of the paper is to establish the role of the senatorial inspection in the elaboration of a new policy with respect to the Baltic provinces during the reign of Alexander III and to determine its specific features in comparison with earlier revisions. In order to solve the problem, the authors suggest approaching it from the standpoint of new political history, shifting attention from specific acts of state power meant to change the judicial and educational systems of the imperial outskirts to the existing practices of organising interaction between the centre and the periphery when developing a programme of reforms. The study is based on various archival and published historical sources. Some archival materials have never been analysed previously, which allows the authors to examine both the interpersonal relations of representatives of the empire with the local community and the process of developing a programme of reforms in the Ostsee region in the 1880s. The authors conclude that the inspection was conducted in order to gather material in accordance with a programme of reforms prepared beforehand. The government was interested in obtaining the basis for a policy of administrative and political incorporation of the periphery into the empire. To achieve this goal, the Russian autocracy spared neither human nor material resources.

AB The article addresses the problems of the development of the Greek-Slavic and Romano-Germanic worlds: historical, political, economic, religious and socio-cultural contradictions between the East and the West. This involves the issues relating to the destiny and the future of the Slavic peoples, particularly the history of the Slavic community, which in many respects determined the lifestyle and mentality of Slays, their weak and strong points, what distinguishes them from Western European peoples.
   The article reveals the world significance of the teachings and ideas of Cyril and Methodius that gave the world fundamentally new political, economic, cultural, scientific and religious dimensions. This gave the start to the interaction between the Latin and the Cyrillic worlds, Byzantine and Slavic traditions in time-space continuum of the East, Russia, the West and Slavdom.
   The author touches upon the dramatic history of Slavic people whose attempts to form their own independent states failed, except for Russia. Hot disputes of Slavophiles and Westemizers on a historical way of the development of Russia, on the Eastern question did not result in any certain decision. The relationships between the East and the West, the Greek-Slavic and Romano-Germanic worlds obtain the universal global dimension and significance. The article presents possible ways of resolving the confrontation between the East and the West.

DT Article
ID SIEBER; STATE
AB This article discusses the main provisions of the Marxist theory of money in the context of modern trends in economic science. The problem of money in Marxism rarely became the subject of scientific research in the Soviet period of history, even less attention is paid to it now. This is probably due to the fact that Marx does not have a holistic concept of money, in his works you can find only disparate and often contradictory statements about what money is, what is their origin. For example, Marx rejected the quantitative theory of money, despite the fact that it is the basis of most monetary concepts. At the same time, in Marx's works one can find many constructive hypotheses and theoretical findings that have enriched economic science. The theory of evolution of Marx value forms is an undoubted contribution to the development of the labor theory of value. Marxist understanding of money has played an important role in understanding how the mechanism of the capitalist economy works. The Marxist understanding of money was not devoid of flaws and contradictions, like any other scientific theory. The article deals in detail with the main provisions of the Marxist theory of value and the associated theory of money. It is also shown that Marx's theory of cost was the result of his application of the dialectical method of research, which helped to avoid logical contradictions of the labor theory of cost inherent, for example, for the theoretical constructions of Ricardo. The paper deals with the contradictions characteristic of the Marxist theory of money.

DE George Vernadsky; life and scientific work; Charles Halperin;
   translation; Eurasianism; Ukrainian identity
ID RUSSIA
AB A study of Vernadsky's legacy is a very dramatic process. It is full of strange contradictions. In Russia, the research began only in the last decade of the previous century and is still in progress. In the USA, the life and scholarly works by George Vernadsky attracted the attention in the previous decade. It resulted in two articles, the best and the only outcome, written by the famous specialist in the Russian history and historiography Charles Halperin. This review is devoted to the publication of a translation of the biggest article by Halperin (1985), and a translation of his recent article from one of the Russian historical journals. The author of this review questions the quality of the translation and critically comments on it. According to the author, Halperin's perception of Vernadsky was influenced by his negative attitude to Eurasianism. But Vernadsky never was a participant of this political movement, moreover, he was against it. As for his scholarly ideas, it can be said that Eurasianism was one of the best explanation of the Russian historical process. Recently, Halperin's opinion about the significance of Vernadsky's legacy has been improved, and we hope that this trend will continue to strength. Surprisingly, however, Halperin supported some doubtful ideas by some Ukrainian authors who found a certain Ukrainian identity in Vernadsky. The author of review cannot see any trace of such connections between this statement and Vernadky's deep love for the Ukrainian history and culture. The author's conclusion is that the translation of the work by the famous American historian will be currently very useful to the Russian readers.

DT Article
DE public administration; consultative bodies; discourse; advisory
   committee; "fair balance"; public councils; independence
AB The article deals with the problem of reflecting the national administrative tradition in the design and activities of advisory/ consultative bodies under executive authorities. Despite the fact that the number and importance of such bodies are constantly growing worldwide, there is practically no comparative analysis of the functioning of such bodies in different administrative traditions. The article fills this gap on the basis of a comparative analysis of the discourse on advisory bodies in the United States and the Russian Federation. The materials for the analysis were legal acts, expert literature prepared by the authorities and academic research. The author put forward the hypothesis that problems that are consistently reproduced in the discourse of advisory bodies, be it American advisory committees or Russian public councils, reflect the national administrative specifics and prove to be fundamentally unresolved within the framework of the given administrative system. Based on the analysis of the Federal Act on Advisory Committees (FACA) of 1972, as well as works about the practice of its enforcement, it was shown that in the US, advisory committees act as a mechanism for obtaining and using an expert knowledge accumulated by civil society. Therefore, the central problem of discourse is the question of the ratio of professional experts who are carriers of specialized (including scientific) knowledge and "lay experts" who have life experience related to this field, including experience of protecting their interests. It is shown that this problem has not received a satisfactory solution. In the Russian Federation, advisory bodies are inscribed in a fundamentally different government context. An analysis of the Russian discourse on public councils, including federal and regional legislation (on the example of the Sverdlovsk Region) showed that the main objective of public councils is to monitor the activities of executive bodies (that is, the function that the legislative bodies exercise in the US). Therefore, the main problem is the problem of independence of public councils from the authorities under which they function. This problem is solved in the spirit of the Russian administrative tradition through monitoring the formation and activity of public councils by the structure external to the executive authorities. The role of such a structure is played by Public Chambers of all levels. Based on the analysis of the activities of the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation on "resetting" public councils under federal executive bodies (2015-2017) and the activities of the Public Chamber of the Sverdlovsk Region on "resetting" public councils under regional executive bodies (2017-2018), the author came to the conclusion that the problem has not received a satisfactory solution yet. The study conducted by the author shows that the problem that appears in the discourse on advisory/consultative bodies as a key issue and is constantly reproduced in public discussions and in the process of lawmaking and law enforcement depends on a whole range of factors that determine the nature of the national administrative tradition: the type of state structure, the nature of the political regime, the dominant type of administrative culture, etc.

TI NEW PHASE OF DECOLONIZATION: FROM FORMAL SOVEREIGNITY TO REAL ONE

DT Article
DE formal decolonization; actual decolonization; comprehensive
   independence; international law; Russia; China; USA; EU
AB After the collapse of the bipolar world order, politicians and experts almost everywhere faced the requirement of making corrections in the political concepts and narratives of decolonization as a dominant global development trend. Not a long time before, the United States proclaimed the process of decolonization completed and referred to it as a past era supplanted by imperatives of modernization, Europeanization, westernization, globalization, etc. In reality, however, only two of its phases - attainment of formal political independence and gaining sovereignty over natural resources - have been completed. The process entered the third phase of actual decolonization when China and a large group of rapidly developing economies had turned into the world's manufacturing and assembly factories. Russia's reemerging as one of the leading global players bolsters up and further spurs the process of decolonization. The balance of forces on the world stage goes through tectonic shifts and gives additional chances for final success of decolonization. What is expected to come up is the next, and final, phase of practical decolonization. Its purpose is to acquire technological and financial independence as well as the ability to parry military force or threat of the use of force whatever its origin. There exist objective and subjective factors that get in the way of decolonization. These include political destabilization and pressure, redirection of financial flows, sanctions, wars, etc. They will not have a critical impact, however, if all constructive forces around the world pool their efforts towards cooperation. With such an understanding of dominant and latent trends, ongoing worldwide transformations look no longer like unpredictable and dramatic chaotization of international relations but are being taken for what they actually are: the struggle for practical decolonization of the parts of the planet that used to be dependent territories.

AB The relevance of the study is due to the presence of conflicts in the social and civil spheres of life both in modern Russia and in the world. A historical excursion into the problem under consideration will help to identify the causes of the confrontation in social conflicts, to develop measures aimed at eliminating and overcoming them. The article discusses the issues associated with the emergence of red banditry in the northern part of the modern Kemerovo region after the end of the Civil War. New archival materials are being introduced into scientific circulation. The novelty of the study is that based on the analysis of the data, the conclusions of researchers involved in the history of red banditry in Siberia are corrected. The author dwells on the facts of the manifestation of red banditry in the Mariinsky district of Tomsk province, reveals the essence of this phenomenon. It is proved that the causes of this phenomenon, in addition to the negative reaction of the Soviet government to the Kolchak regime, the low level of political and spiritual culture of representatives of the new government, the strong influence of partisans, the emergence of a sense of impunity and permissiveness, included such reasons as personal contempt and hostility between ordinary residents, as well as basic desire to appropriate another's property.

DT Article
DE political text; uncertainty; political communication; justification of
   worth logics; political capital; dispositif
AB In this article, political text is treated as a construct for expressing one's viewpoint on the events of political landscape; creating a certain effect on different groups of society with an aim to encourage collective will and actions; as well as representing a collective interest. Types of structural and situational factors (including structural balance of social and political groups, cultural and symbolic space, participants of a communication, and their resources recognized by a society) and the way they influence the recipient's interpretation of a text's message are shown. Stuart Hall's Model of Communication, possible ways of coding and decoding both text content and ideological principles of an author and audience are described and discussed. It is noted that, due to the fundamental features of social communication, both authors and recipients find themselves in a situation of constant cognitive and interpretative uncertainty. Whereas situational factors do not distort the meaning but contribute to its construction and further interpretation, the structure of participants, their resources, and the context of communication is accomplished. This article explores the process of text construction and its meaning's further reconstruction as an active process, in which an agreement is reached between communicative participants on the meaning of their own piece of text and its cultural, social, structural, pragmatic and political contexts, produced by the subjects under the condition of uncertainty. The model reflects the process and factors of text production and perception of its meaning. It is revealed that the interpretation of the meaning of political texts, and the position of participants of communication, depends primarily on claims that they possess social and political capital as resources that ensure the encouragement of collective will and representation of interests. The role of dispositives (as a context of communication) that allows the regulation of cognitive uncertainty and which define appropriate ways of qualification is shown. The article also describes the model of the process of text construction and meaning reconstruction with cultural, social, structural, pragmatic and political context being taken into account as well as the role of political texts in communicative strategies of political actors.

They analyze as well the similarities and differences of the World and All-Russian congresses and conclude that the All-Russian congresses of political scientists, within the last two decades, in many respects have reached the level of the World congresses. No less important is the conclusion that the Russian political science needs to rethink the fundamental political problems of the post-digital dialogue of cultures in the period of drastic world order transformations.

AB Over the last fifteen years municipalities in Russia have lost a significant part of their financial autonomy: the average share of transfers from regional budgets to municipal budgets has doubled. Simultaneously, municipalities have lost their political autonomy from the regional authorities. The article is dedicated to finding answers to such questions as whether the growth of the financial and political dependence of municipalities went hand in hand with the politicization of regional intergovernmental transfers and whether election results affect the amount of funds received by municipalities from regional budgets. The authors used an original dataset on two types of intergovernmental transfers, the distribution of which depends on regional authorities, for 70 municipalities of the Perm Krai and the Novgorod Oblast, 2013-2017.
   The regression analysis conducted by the authors confirmed the hypothesis that redistribution of budgetary funds between municipalities is decided on political grounds, but this holds true only at the beginning of the electoral cycle, which is consistent with the model of rewarding a loyal electorate. As is the case at the federal level, this is about rewarding those who produce "good" electoral results and punishing those who produce "bad" electoral results rather than courting swing voters or buying off most problematic territories. The fact that the municipality has its own parliamentarian in the regional legislature can also contribute to obtaining more transfers. Municipal needs for infrastructure have no impact on the size of transfers.

DE Poland; new authoritarianism; Law and Justice; J. Kaczynski; good turn
   policy; political drama; Civil Platform
AB The authors share their reflections, awakened by the reading of the book by the Polish sociologist M. Gdula, "New authoritarianism", published in Warsaw in 2018. Attention is drawn to the fact that the phenomenon of new authoritarianism, which attracted the attention of Polish scholars, is not a purely Polish phenomenon. On the contrary, its features are found in different countries and regions, which are largely explained by the reaction of society and political elites to the painful processes of globalization, modernization and democratization, which are characteristic of the last third of the 20th - early 21st centuries. This type of authoritarianism is called new because, unlike traditional dictatorships, it appeals to democratic practices, to competitive electoral process and to democratic imagination. The people, as the sovereign of power, give the government the mandate to unlimited domination over the norms of the Constitution. Justice as an expression of the people's will stands above the law. The quintessence of this authoritarian project lies in solidarity narrowed to its own national community and its dominance over the weaker, minorities and outsiders. The party "Right and Justice" (PiS), led by J. Kaczynski, came to power in 2015, which marked the country's movement in this direction as "a policy of a good turn", focusing on the social support of the population and the policy of cultural change. Support for PiS by the majority of the population is explained both by partial satisfaction with its socioeconomic policy and by its sense of belonging to the "political drama" staged by the party leader.

Theoretical provisions, related to the change of the main influence on the level of innovational activity, are generalized: shift of focus from support for offer of innovational technologies to formation of demand for innovations from economic subjects and society. The authors explain insufficient level of capability for innovations and acceptance of new technological achievements as a component of non-material assets of economic growth, related to its humanitarian component - formation and development of human potential in the conditions of society and knowledge economy. The authors also explain susceptibility to innovations as a result of taking science and education beyond the limits of the innovational process, and other elements of the humanitarian component. The role of non-technological components is studied: organizational, marketing, social, etc. The factors hindering the innovations are given. The main directions of regional innovational development in view of formed global and Russian tendencies are given, as well as connection between innovational development of the region and benchmarking, innovational development and territorial marketing.

DE Komi dramatic art; Gennady Yushkov; genre; direction; hero; theme
AB Introduction: the article is devoted to the research of the famous Komi writer, poet and playwright Gennady Yushkov's plays dated by 1990-2000. He starts his creative way in the 1950th, disclosing the art skill in various genres including dramaturgic. From this time until the beginning of 1980th, G. Yushkov works generally in genres of the socio-moral drama and social and everyday life comedy, realistically recreating public contradictions, acute social problems of the 50-80th. The main theme of the playwright is the village theme, the theme of improvement of life of peasants. The main characters of these plays are people with active life position, the creators changing the world around. Intensive socio-political changes of the turn of XX-XXI centuries introduce the correctives in development of literary process, affecting the creative consciousness of writers. It would be interesting to see how public cataclysms of the 1990-2000th influenced on the artistic world of G. Yushkov, to reveal change of the principles of typification and generalization in its creative system.
   Objective: to research Gennady Yushkov's plays of the turn of XX-XXI centuries, to identify their distinctive features in comparison with the dramaturgic works written by him earlier.
   Research materials: the plays by G. Yushkov of the 1990-2000th.
   Results and novelty of the research: the analysis of dramaturgic works of G. Yushkov of the specified period reveals narrowing of the purposes of the hero of his plays. This is not any more the hero who is actively solving public problems, but the character, guided only by personal desires. Along with we observe narrowing of genre frameworks of plays of the author. Now they are not multi-act dramas or comedies, they are and texts in two-three pages (sketches). The theme of the works also changes: he is still the playwright of the village theme, but he reveals this theme through a prism of the family theme. In the period of the turn of XX-XXI centuries we can observe that G. Yushkov creates his plays in realistic direction and also follows laws of creation of dramaturgic characters.

AB The paradigm of "knowledge economy" influences socio-economic and political processes within national economies. The primary role of knowledge, wide reproduction of the elements of technical interaction of innovational goods, quick growth of high-tech sector of economy, and qualitative development of human capital - these elements are the main requirements set to the countries that implement the projects of "knowledge economy". At that, the existing difficulties of implementing the paradigm of "knowledge economy" are related to old ideas of effective development of economy, science, and technological spheres. This problem lies in the system of higher education, which needs substantial modernization. According to this thesis, the purpose of the research is stage-by-stage evaluation of formation of the "knowledge economy" formation through modernization of education system. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to solve the following tasks: study "knowledge economy" from the positions of determining the theoretical regularities and the essence of this category; conduct analysis of genesis of "knowledge economy" at various stages of society's development; determine peculiarities of "knowledge economy" in the system of higher education; form the system of "knowledge economy" according to the authors' ideas. Scientific novelty of the research consists in studying the issue of "knowledge economy" through the prism of modernization of the system of higher education. Besides, the authors perform comparative evaluation of the levels of higher education of the USA and the Russian Federation and determine the final results of "knowledge economy" formation in each of the above models. The result of the research is formed proprietary system of interaction within "knowledge economy", between the institutional environment of higher education, R&D system, market structures, state, and human. This research is interesting from the position of application of the new approach to studying the peculiarities of "knowledge economy" formation. According to this, the article will be interesting for specialists that participate in implementation of strategic projects in the sphere of formation of a new economic model of the country's development.

   "A Letter to a Hindu"; vegetarianism; the critique of civilization
AB The article is based on the analysis of the correspondence between Leo Tolstoy and Mahatma Gandhi which consists of six letters written in 1909-1910. It examines their shared outlook on the role of violence and nonviolence in the life of both a person and a society. It is shown that, despite the difference in religious, cultural and national traditions forming the backgrounds of the thinkers and the dissimilarity of their personal lives, they were very close in their world outlook and morality. They are united by the inner and consistent dedication to the idea of nonviolence. Nonresistance to evil by force, which is an adequate presentation of love according to Tolstoy, and the concept of Satyagraha, which is a positive formula of the passive resistance, according to Gandhi, are identical concepts. Both thinkers considered the specific conditions of the struggle for the national liberation against the British rule not to be an argument permitting a dissimilarity from the principle of nonviolence. "A Letter to a Hindu", in which Tolstoy develops the ideas of his treatise "The Law of Love and The Law of Violence", assumed the character of a program document for the nonviolent struggle of the Indian against the colonialists in South Africa. Tolstoy and Gandhi are at one in thinking that nonviolence as a social position is a consequence, expression and development of an individually responsible religious and moral personal life-choice. They elaborated a number of basic virtues of the individual nonviolent life philosophy: its first step is a chaste repression of the bodily needs starting with vegetarianism. It also includes manual labour, fearlessness and unconditional abandonment of lying. A radical critique of the material civilization is one more point making their views closer. Generally, the article characterizes Gandhi's teaching as the development and a new stage of Tolstoy's teaching: it extends the idea of nonviolence to the sphere of the political and social activity of people.

DT Article
DE The structure of geopolitics; the differentiation of geopolitics by
   spheres; the differentiation of geopolitics by sub-spheres; the
   environment-sphere structure of modern geopolitics; the scientific and
   disciplinary structure of modern geopolitics
AB The purpose of this article is to analyze the structure of modern geopolitics, the description of the views of the classics, the founders of geopolitics and modern geopoliticians on the structure of this science.
   The structure of classical geopolitics is represented by the concepts of the German geographer Friedrich Ratzel, the Swedish state scholar Rudolf Chellen and the German geopolitician Erich Obst. Classics of geopolitics do not formulate the structure of their science in a complete form, but the idea of it can be derived by analyzing their works.
   In particular, Ratzel concluded that to study and understand society, it is necessary to take into account not only its "soil" but also its "blood", to involve data not only from geography, but also from history, anthropology, ethnography, and cultural studies. These scientific disciplines constitute, according to Ratzel, the structure of political geography created by him, or geopolitics. In addition, Ratzel science, as he himself admitted, can be structured according to the spheres of nature, that is, is divided into: the geosphere (land area); hydrosphere (aquatic environment); atmosphere (air).
   Rudolf Chellen continued Ratzel's geopolitical approach and applied it to the study of states. The Chellenge model of the state involves five different aspects of it: the territory, the economy, the people, society and government, and five scientific disciplines exploring these aspects: geopolitics (the science of the state as a geographical area); economy policy (science of economics, where the state acts as a national economy); demopolitics (the science of the country's population); sociopolitics (the science of a society governed by the state); powerpolitics (the science of power, in which the state acts as a system of domination and control). Chellen defines the structure of geopolitics more strictly than Ratzel. It consists of topopolitics, morphopolitics and physiopolitics.
   Erich Obst structured the world on the borders of the land surface occupied by the colonial powers and on the population living in this area. As a result, he has a picture that characterizes the distribution of the surface and population of the globe between the great powers. The structure of geopolitics as a science, according to Obst, can be represented as its differentiation into two components: the geopolitics of the territories of states and, in general, the earth's surface; geopolitics of the population of the state and, in general, the population of the Earth.
   Modern geopolitics continues the traditions established by the classics. It continues the Ratzel-Chellen line of differentiation of scientific directions of geopolitics, it adheres to Obst's line on the differentiation of the world according to zones of influence of the leading powers. The modem world is now divided between the great powers not only by spheres (political, military, economic, cultural), but also by sub-spheres. In the political sphere, the sub-spheres of domestic and foreign policy are clearly distinguished, in the economic sphere, the sub-spheres of finance, production, trade, energy, transport, tourism, etc., in the cultural sphere, the sub-spheres of art, sports, fashion, etc. Modem geopolitics includes, in addition to classical environments (geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere), the underwater environment, space and virtual environments of the Internet, radio, TV, printed materials. In the process of complicating international life, the emergence of other spheres and subsubspheres is possible. This manifests itself in the structure of the real world, as well as in the structure of geopolitics, as a scientific discipline.
   Thus, on the basis of the ideas of the classics in modem geopolitics, an environment-sphere structure has developed. Since its inception, modem geopolitics has significantly expanded the subject of its research, and today its structure includes such scientific subdisciplines as geohistory, geoeconomics, geoculturology, geoethnopolicy, geoconfessiology, geoconflictology, global studies, geofuturology, and others.

AB Although, in comparison to other foreign parties to the Syrian conflict, Russia plays a very modest role in resolving the refugee crisis, the latter echoed in Russia as well. One of the consequences of this crisis is that it brought the Circassian issue back to the domestic political agenda in Russia - first and foremost, at the regional level.
   After the start of the civil war in Syria the Circassians - descendants of the Adyghes who were forced to move to the Ottoman Empire in 19th century - began to migrate to Russia. Most of them settled in the Northern Caucasus - Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia. However, they faced a lot of problems, especially those Circassians who moved to Karachay-Cherkessia: its authorities do not favor an inflow of Circassian migrants because they fear a change in the balance of the ethnical forces in the region and reflect the attitudes of the Karachai majority. As a result, while in Adygea and Kabardino-Balkaria repatriates from Syria obtain support from the regional authorities, in Karachay-Cherkessia they can rely only on the local philanthropists and the Circassian community.
   The article is devoted to the analysis of the key factors that hamper Circassians' repatriation to Karachay-Cherkessia and impede their adaptation to living in the region. The empirical data come from the surveys of the citizens from the four Circassian villages with a significant number of repatriates as well as interviews with the Circassian migrants from Syria who settled in the region.

AB The article describes the transformation processes that form the models of information interaction between the authorities, mass media and society in modern Russia. During the Soviet period, the activities of the media in the USSR were determined by the state, which shaped public consciousness in the country with the help of canonical ideological attitudes. By the early 1990s, the model of state domination over society was transformed into a new socio-political state - the domination of society over the state. The transformations also affected the activities of Russian mass media, which made a full turn by the beginning of the 21st century and returned to their original information and communication position. Genetic (state) nature again prevailed in the work of Russian mass media, which determined the formation of a hierarchical model of interaction between the authorities, mass media and society. These processes prove the need for active participation of power structures in the communication and information space of the country, which needs regulation and self-regulation with the help of evidence-based state information policy. We analyze the transformation processes under consideration with the help of several methods: structural and functional analysis, comparative analysis, reconstruction of the addressee of the media text, and some aspects of content analysis. The model of interaction between the authorities and the media affects the formation of the society of small towns, establishment of a positive information field, and identification of the population. We carry out the study on the materials of district newspapers of the Vologda Oblast. Our findings proceeding from the analysis of the current model of information interaction reveal its flaws, which is due to its monologue nature, alleged naturalness of national-civil identification, and creation of the image of the addressee with the identity of naive subject.

AB The study of international relations in general and of international economic relations in particular, provides opportunities for using the methodology of new institutional economics (or its close analogs in other social sciences) to analyze political and economic developments on the global arena. Modern paradigms of international relations represent different cases of institutional analysis applied to the same subject but based on different assumptions, different ethical / philosophical approaches, and relying upon different basic facts or axioms. This paper gives an overview of the key paradigms of the international relations (Realism / Neorealism, Liberalism / Neoliberalism, Marxism / Neomarxism and Constructivism) from the institutional perspective, and examines the current economic conflict between the US and People's Republic of China from the perspective of each paradigm. From the institutional / new institutional methodological perspective, it is interesting to examine how each paradigm of the theory of international relations views international actors and institutions through which they interact. The knowledge about modern paradigms of international relations is necessary for correct interpretation of the academic discourse on the matter, as well as of the policy advice offered by the academic and expert community to policymakers.

AB The paper presents an analysis of Russian federal laws and state programs with a focus on the stated principles and objectives of language policy. Key questions posed in the paper include the following ones: How are the goals and objectives of the language policy formulated, and how implementable are they, taking into account the formulations used? To what extent the goals, objectives and activities declared meet the needs of socio-economic development of the country and the welfare of its citizens? It should be noted that texts of normative legal acts of the Russian Federation, which determine the language policy and establish the ways of its implementation, only indirectly refer to the ultimate goal of language policy (that is the welfare of citizens and of the society as a whole, the full realization of human potential). The choice of wording in the documents, which are fundamental for the Russian language policy, implies that both in the mass consciousness and in the political discourse some very mythologized and simplified ideas about the goals and objectives of language policy are tenacious and popular. The formulation of the goals and objectives of language policy in normative legal acts of the Russian Federation, the choice of ways to implement these goals and objectives in the government programs do not allow to say that the potential of language policy as the tool of social and economic development of the country, ensuring social and economic interests of its citizens, is fully realized by the participants of the norm-setting process.

AB The paper studies integration processes of North Ossetia into Russian socio-political and cultural space. The investigation is aimed at identifying and studying socio-cultural factors promoting formation of Russian sovereignty and all-Russian identity. The most effective methods of assimilation of the new territory is Russian confessional policy. Another mechanism for establishment of Russian sovereignty is the education system that includes the inoculation of the Russian language. The work determines the role of Ossetian intellectuals as a socially and culturally dominating group, a conductor of Russia cultural policy. The most important factor of sovereignty establishment became the city space with its polyethnical population, social and cultural institutes. The study of library experience shows the success in realization of such forms and resources of such city culture as theater, cinematography, libraries, museums, cultural-enlightenment capable of forming ideas of civil world, unity and integrity of state. The paper studies the significance of historical collective memory, constructing citizenship, patriotism and reinforcing the sovereignty. Realization of this function was achieved by the popularization of events in the Russian history when organizing state ceremonies and jubilee celebrations of commemorative dates. All considered factors existed in conditions of different political regimes that introduced their content into traditional forms and created new ones. The urgency of the study of the stated problem is conditioned by the demand of historical experience in the formation of modern state national and cultural policy aimed at the establishment of nationwide identity, Russian nation.

   Palestinian-Israeli conflict; Iranian nuclear program; civil war in
   Syria; new tactical alliances in the Middle East
AB Changes in Israeli regional politics were triggered by the current political situation in the Middle East, characterized by a high degree of intensity and unpredictability. The region experiences a complex process of serious political changes making Israel adjust its regional policy to the new challenges. The article focuses upon the new elements of Israelis strategy on key regional issues: the settlement of Palestinian-Israeli conflict; new approaches to countering Iranian nuclear program; the Syrian civil war and escalation of terrorism activities. The aim of the article is to describe and analyze new trends in Israeli regional strategy over the past 10 years identifying its external and internal factors. The main external factor is a close partnership of Israel with US, which plays a key role in supporting Israel's regional and international status. The changes taking place inside the region could be considered as internal factors. They include Arab Spring; prospects for settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict; the growth of the Islamic radicalism and terrorism, new terrorist groups such as ISIS, and the civil war in Syria.
   The main changes of Israeli regional policy include toughening approaches to resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, in particular, de facto abandonment of the "two states for two peoples" formula. Equally important are events that, although not directly related to Israel, are changing its regional agenda. Assessment of Iran's nuclear program as an existential threat explains Israel's negative attitude to the international agreement with Iran in 2015 during the presidency of B. Obama (JCPOA). The subsequent withdrawal of the Trump administration from this agreement strengthened Israel's anti-Iranian position. This also allowed Israel to develop cooperative ties with the so-called pro-Western states of the region, such as Saudi Arabia and some Persian Gulf countries in pursuit of containing the Iranian nuclear threat and its growing regional influence. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries became real partners of Israel in confronting Iran. This gives the Israeli state the opportunity to at last enter the regional system and free itself from the traditional image of rogue state among the Muslim countries in the Middle East.

DE youth; polyethnicity; worldview and value orientations; interethnic

AB The article presents the results of a three-year sociological study of the causes of social tension among the youth in Kuban as a polyethnic region. Based on the results of the survey of high school students, university students and young workers, the authors consider the youth's attitudes to the current government, priorities of state policy, events in Ukraine and Syria, assess the state of interethnic relations in the North Caucasus and the role of Cossacks in Kuban. The article emphasizes that the inconsistency of worldviews and attitudes of the Kuban youth to these issues increased in 2017, i.e. the potential for conflicts on national and political grounds increased, which lead to the growth of social activity of participants in both patriotic actions and social protests. Today, the rejuvenation of social protests is obvious for more and more schoolchildren and teenagers take part in them. There is a growth of both the youth support for state patriotism and radical anti-state protests, and in general the number of the youth indifferent and detached from social processes declines. There is a danger of polarization and radicalization of the youth and accumulation of latent conflict potential. The state patriotic education aiming to ensure the traditional value of sacrifice for the country is eroded by the propaganda of liberal individualism and consumerism which deny such a value; the promotion of volunteerism and mutual aid comes into conflict with the ideas of leadership and competitiveness, and the values of interethnic and inter-religious friendship and respect with the ideas of interethnic and interfaith tolerance. The return to traditional values proclaimed by the state faces the westernization trends, which determines the youth's worldview inconsistency.

   dichotomy; civilizations; modernization theory; institutional theory;

AB Russian society is in search of self-determination. This requires the articulation of strategic goals and basic guidelines for domestic and foreign policy, on which there is a consensus both among the elites and the population - such a consensus is present in modern Russia. However, and most importantly, self-determination requires the choice and acceptance of an effective system of resource mobilization and management, in order to ensure sustainable development - in that sense there is little agreement currently present in Russian society. This article critically reviews the modern theoretical concepts used for the analysis of Russian society, and their instrumental capacity to serve as "coordinate systems" for societal self-determination. The concepts and approaches considered include the cultural East-West dichotomy and Eurasianism; the civilizational approach; the theories of modernization and globalization; institutional theories ("open/limited access orders" and "inclusive/extractive" institutions); and the theory of institutional X- and Y-matrices. The author discusses the advantages and limitations of these approaches and substantiates the argument that the theory of X- and Y-institutional matrices may hold greater promise as a "coordinate system" for the self-determination of Russian society. It is a meso-level theory, which identifies economic, political and ideological institutions and ways of including resources in economic and social activity. It allows the determination of the contours of an appropriate system of organization and the mobilization of available resources given the set of specific external and internal challenges. The theory is ideologically neutral and has a pragmatic focus. It can also be used to develop appropriate metrics for the evaluation of Russian institutional reforms and their outcomes.

AB With growing doubts about the universality of Western institutional models, there is now more attention paid to the analysis of models that are developing beyond the "western world". This paper is devoted to a comparative analysis of countries with either predominant Western or non-Western institutional models of the economy. An overview of studies in political economy, as well as the main more modern institutional theories about similar subjects, are presented. The paper focuses mainly on the approach developed in the author's theory of X- and Y-institutional matrices (Kirdina, 2014 [2001; 2000]; Kirdina-Chandler, 2017). In this theory, Western institutional models are characterised by the predominance of a set of Y-matrix institutions, among them the institutions of a market economy, federal political structure, and individualistic ideology. Non-Western models are distinguished by the dominance of a set of X-matrix institutions, among them the institutions of a redistributive economy, unitary-centralised political structure, and communitarian ideology. The X-and-Y-institutional matrices theory was used as the methodological basis for two research projects carried out in 2014-2017, the results of which are presented in the paper. The first project was devoted to analysing the influence of geographic/climatic factors on the development of institutional models. A reliable statistical relationship between the extremes of geographic/climatic factors and the predominant institutional model - the western (less extreme) and the non-western (more extreme) - is identified and logically justified. The second project was to study the long-term dynamics (since 1820) of the coexistence of countries with Western and non-Western models. A cyclical process of changing world economic leadership, expressed in the share of GDP produced by each group of countries in the world GDP, was revealed. Prior to the spread of the industrial revolution, countries with non-Western institutional models dominated in the world GDP. Since the 1870's the domination of Y-countries started, which began to produce more than half of the world GDP. The biggest gap between these two groups of countries was observed in 1950-1970 but following this period it began to decline. Since 2008/2010 X-countries began outperforming Y-countries by share of world GDP, and this advantage is gradually increasing. It is hypothesised that a change of dominance in the global economic configuration and the search for new coalitions are some of the main factors for the increase in radical sentiment in the world and international tension.

DT Article
DE the Soviet Union; mobilization economy; collective farm system;
   peasantry; stalinist modernization; forced work; agriculture
AB The authors consider the collective farm system as the main source and structural element of the Soviet mobilizational economy by analyzing modern methodological innovations in Russian economic history and documentary evidence. Among the main parameters of the study are: periodization of the collective farm system within the mobilization model of development; methods of forced work in the Soviet village; the typology of mobilizing management practices; the tactic of resistance to power; and the content of communicative practices and mass consciousness reactions, mediated by the formation of the mobilization management model. These data indicate that the existing specificity of socio-political interaction from the 1930s to the 1950s demonstrates inconsistency and the antinomy of real and declared goals of agricultural policy. The mobilization model (economically justified only in conditions of external aggression), demagogically covered by the opportunity of building socialism, Bolshevik policy, and education of the peasantry in the spirit of collectivism, in reality did not have development as its basis. It was only a tool to optimize resources and solve the tasks of maintaining socio-political stability. The viability of peasant farming in these conditions was provided by maintaining some market elements (the household plot, the possibility to sell products at the market, etc.), which were present in the economy throughout the period under review.

AB In the article, the problem of Soviet technocracy is again actualized from a new perspective. The question of the applicability of the concept of technocracy to the Soviet system of governance is being considered. Summarizing a certain result of research in this area, there is a variety of existing research positions in relation to this phenomenon. The cultural-historical origins and features of the Soviet way of managing socio-economic and scientific-technical development are analyzed, which makes it possible to speak about it as part of an unrealized socio-utopian megaproject. On the basis of the socio-historical approach, the roots and prerequisites for the formation of elements of technocracy in the Soviet system are revealed. As part of this, it is proposed to consider the Soviet political and economic system as a corporation, and the layer of scientists-administrators and "red directors" integrated into power - as its technostructure. Outlines the social boundaries and scope of the Soviet technostructure, thereby removing the false opposition of the scientific-technical intelligentsia and techno-bureaucracy as its constituent parts. Special attention is paid to analyzing the problems of the practice of Soviet socio-economic planning and attempts to solve them by the Soviet technostructure. In this regard, the historical fate of the national technocracy is illustrated by the most striking examples of the personal and scientific destinies of its major representatives. This allowed us to conclude that the key feature of the Soviet technocracy was its secondary nature - its subordinate supercentralization of the systems of social management and resource allocation. Directly indicated features appeared in inherited from the XIX century objectivist attitudes regarding scientific and technological progress, which had a decisive influence on managerial decision-making in the fields of scientific planning and scientific planning. Based on the indicated range of questions, a theoretically significant conclusion is drawn about the hybrid nature of the Soviet system of governance, which contained certain elements of technocracy, the reconstruction of the social meanings of from this, the prospective problems of researching the mechanisms of interrelations of power, science and technology in the Soviet evolution and whose actions have a positive cognitive potential only in the deep historical context of the national culture. Proceeding state formulated position in relation to the Soviet megaproject. This also results in the main features of the Soviet technostructure: statism, a rigid linkage of social progress with scientific and technological progress, loyalty to the ideas of socialism.

AB The first edition was published in London in 1944 and soon reprinted in the U.S.A. Konovalov was a Russian emigrant and a Professor in Birmingham University. In his constructions Russian and British intellectual traditions merged. It is concluded that the concept presented in the book fit well into the British historiographical discourse. S. A. Konovalov set a task to understand the evolution of ideas about the Russian-Polish ethnographic borderland. He fully shared the prevailing view in UK that the optimal line of demarcation between Poland and the USSR should be the Curzon line. S. A. Konovalov considered the problem of borders painful, generated by political adventurism, irreconcilable struggle of ideologies, catastrophic consequences of disintegration of empires and at the same time short-sightedness of Versailles system. Overcoming the shortcomings was inevitable, and the search for the optimal Russian-Polish border was among the priorities. Also the article analyzes the reaction of the scientific community to the publication of the book, primarily the critical views of the Polish historians (O. Halecki and W. Lednicki). The article shows that the views of S. A. Konovalov were formed both under the influence of his intellectual environment and under the influence of current historical events.

AB The article considers some modern interpretations and various classifications of information wars. As a result of comparing different classifications of information wars by Russian and Western experts the following conclusions can be drawn. On the one hand, the information wars classifications have numerous disadvantages, and, on the other hand, they have common points that unite these so different classifications. As a result of research, it became possible to identify the most typical grounds for classifying information wars and the basic types of the information war. The addition of the classification of information wars from the standpoint of political psychology is offered, which can contribute to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon under consideration. The article investigates the cases of information confrontation; the authors raise the question of the necessity of psychological research aimed at minimizing the harmful consequences of information impact on the population.

TI On symbolism in Proclus' Commentary on Plato's Timaeus
SO FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
LA Russian
DT Editorial Material
DE Proclus; the Timaeus; Neoplatonic commentary; symbol; synthema; logos;
   image; theurgy; ontology; myth
AB Many recent studies propose that symbolon and synthema are synonymous in the writings of Proclus. However, his Commentary to Plato's Timaeus contains statements that disprove this opinion. The goal of this paper is to establish the meaning of both terms using the contexts of their actual usage, a textual analysis and a historical and philosophical reconstruction. The author argues that in the writings of Proclus, it is possible to distinguish two types of symbols: the ontological and the exegetical. The ontological symbol (symbolon) is strongly connected to synthema, which appears to be its semantic kernel and formative principle. Together, they establish the sympathetic relations bridging different levels of the ontological hierarchy. Each one of Proclean intelligible gods appears as a cause that produces a chain of consequences, i. e. a series of the god's emanations. Each essence at a lower ontological level is such a consequence, and therefore it carries a synthema as a trace of its first cause. A synthema provides an essence with an ability to discover its own identity against the ontological hierarchy and then allows it to cognize its first cause. This cognition, in turn, becomes the initial point of the ascent (epistrophe) to the intelligible cause. A symbol, as opposed to synthema, is able to receive energies, or 'illumination' of the corresponding gods, which thereafter elevate the subject to a higher ontological level. An exegetical symbol differs from an ontological one by not being related to synthemata, causative chains and particular gods. It is suggested that the exegetic type of Proclean symbolism is related to an older commentary tradition, which goes back to Iamblichus.

   thought; liberalism; conservatism; traditionalism
AB Introduction. The introduction identifies one of the most important problems in the political history of Russia - the problem of determining and choosing the path of the long-term civilizational development in the aspect of liberal and conservative paradigm. Methods and materials. As the main methods the authors apply: the historical-comparative, systemic, typological and historical-political ones. The main sources are the following: "Plan of State Transformation" by M.M. Speransky and "Note on Ancient and New Russia in Its Political and Civil Relations" by N.M. Karamzin. Analysis. In the course of the comparative analysis the authors carry out the study of the plan of M.M. Speransky's state reforms and N.M. Karamzin's political program in the aspect of the liberal and conservative axiology. The authors conclude that there were two different models of civilizational development of the state. One of them, represented by M.M. Speransky, suggested radical changes in the political system, legislation, social relations and led Russia to the liberal Western path of development. N.M. Karamzin proceeded from the priority of national and state traditions and the perniciousness of transferring European political institutions, customs and practicies to the Russian soil. Results. The result of the study is the conclusion that in the complete absence of a basis for the formation of liberalism in Russia, M.M. Speransky's constitutional search was doomed to failure and resulted in the practice of building a system of the rational public administration within the framework of absolutism. Centuries-old historical traditions of Russia were much stronger than the desire of Alexander I to give the country a Constitution.

AB The author considers new phenomena in the information sphere of civil society, their influence on the nature and forms of its development, emphasizing that the development of the Russian civil society follows the general formation of the global civil society. Humankind has come to the objectively inevitable and qualitatively new stage in the co-evolution of biosphere, society and technosphere - the emergence of noosphere. The social-political essence of the new stage of social evolution is the search for a sustainable life regime based on the principles of civil justice in the interests of everyone on the planet. Social statistics and sociology highlight the peculiarity in the development of digital technologies - the growth of material and informational dysfunctions of the global and regional scale. The information sphere that has developed in the neoliberal paradigm of economic, political, and social practices does not meet the new global challenges and the needs of civil society and social state for it continues to function in the interests of small elite groups. Misinformation becomes widespread, which leads to the loss by information of its key function of the reliable reflection of reality and to the partial transformation of the media into institutions of social and political manipulation. Based on the data of sociological studies, the author proves that the structure and forms of the Russian media dysfunctions reflect global trends, and concludes that the need for publicity is a result of the "truth crisis"; thus, the media's task - to reliably reflect social reality - becomes an imperative and a pass to the future. The sustainable development of the global and Russian civil society depends on the successful social-political reconstruction of the information sphere based on the principles of co-evolution of man, society and nature.

AB The article analyzes the traditional state as a historical, political, legal, and cultural phenomenon that has had a fundamental impact on the transformation of the socio-political organization of society, on the legal and socio-cultural development of modern social systems. The authors argue that the traditional state should be characterized as a specific form of the political, legal, social, and cultural organization since it contains all the institutions that provide for the management of various processes in society, and has the operating forms and mechanism of its preservation and reproduction. In addition, the work shows that the traditional state forms special legal regimes, as well as forms of socio-political integrity. The authors prove that the specificity of the traditional state as a historical type has manifested in a whole series of system characteristics (functions, structure, and forms) incomparable in full with the organizational features of other historical types of states, primarily the modern state.

AB The article analyzes the outcomes of the political development of the post-communist states. First, on the basis of the various quantitative measures of modernization, democratization and state capacity, such as the Bertelsmann Transformation Index, the Economist Democracy Index etc., the author documents the close relationship between a country's successes in political democratization and market economy, on the one hand, and strengthening statehood, on the other hand. After that the author presents the analytical review of the evolution of the political regime and electoral formulae (taking into account the effect of the changes that were introduced to the electoral formulae), as well as the development of political parties and party systems. The author compares trajectories of the development for the countries located in the Western and Eastern parts of the post-communist space. The article explores the role of the external factors, such as states' desire to fit into the institutions of the European integration, and the internal factors that influence transformation strategies at different stages of post-communist development. The author evaluates the phenomenon of retraditionalization, which takes place both in the West and in the East of the post-communist world. The final section of the article demonstrates the correlation between the level of competitiveness and the institutional maturity of party systems and the degree of democracy/authoritarianism of the political regime. The author concludes that the concept of the "post-communist space" has not lost its relevance for Political Science, because the transformation processes in most countries of this region have not been completed yet.

AB The history of the new Ukrainian autocephaly once again proves the utopian nature of the idea of the universal Orthodoxy, based on strict adherence to the gospel principles. Although all parties to the current Church conflict officially defend such principles, in practice none of them follow them. Universalism is replaced by the competing versions of nationalism, which provides Churches with additional legitimacy in the increasingly secularizing societies that pay little attention to the Church dogma, but at the same time retain archaic features. The key factor in the world Orthodox politics is the longstanding rivalry between the Russian and Constantinople churches, which is largely related to the competition between the two national ideas, the Russian and the Greek. This is why the Church of Constantinople unilaterally granted autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. The Ukrainian autocephalist movement from the very beginning was based on a demonstrative repulsion for Moscow and has an anti-imperial politicized nature. Constantinople's universalism, which disguises centuries-old nationalism, led to a paradoxical result - the Ecumenical Patriarchate legitimized the creation of a national Church, aimed at maximally weakening its main rival. This is despite the fact that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is the largest in terms of the number of parishes and constitutes an integral part of the Moscow Patriarchate, was not admitted to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

AB This paper argues that despite some peculiarities in the structure of state-church relations in post-Soviet Russia (compared with Western Europe), the Russian case is not uncommon with respect to other secular states. What is popularly described as the "rapprochement" of the Russian authorities with the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) reflects a peculiar kind of political performance rather than action aimed at dismantling the secular order. The key political and social institutions are, in fact, not affected by this "rapprochement". A symbolic policy should not be confused with an instrumental one, as is often mistaken by the scholars who describe the situation as "desecularization". These scholars overlook the fact that both the Orthodox-centered rhetoric of the officials and the staging of Kremlin's special position toward the ROC are spatially anchored. Beyond the territories with a predominantly ethnic Russian population, such symbolic policies are subject to different rules. In the "non-Russian" regions, the authorities maintain "special relations" with clerics of other religious organizations (Islamic and Buddhist). What we face in today's Russia is not the merging of the state with religious organizations (in particular, with the ROC), but rather the use of religious institutions by the state as a resource for the legitimization and strengthening of control. Religious institutions do not act as autonomous players, and especially not as political entities. The authors describe the Kremlin's strategy in the sphere of state-church relations as managed pluralism". This means that the state privileges a number of confessions (the "traditional" ones) and religious organizations, reckoning on their loyalty. At the same time, organizations that are not among the privileged are subject to discrimination and even repression.

   oligarchy; bureaucracy; masses and leaders
AB The utopian Communist ideal of a workers' state, which was put into action after the Bolshevik takeover of power in Russia in 1917, provoked new types of social mobilization, adaptation, and domination and new political institutions. At the core of this experiment was the new concept of Labor Unions as a form of intermediate democracy which could potentially be transformed into a communal state based on the collective production and distribution of property, wealth, and social responsibility between broad nets of workers unions.
   In the sociological literature and international historiography, this social experiment was scrutinized as a rare or even unique historical example of how the abstract syndical concept of a stateless society (based on cooperation and solidarity rather than on bureaucratic control) could be put into reality. This form of self-government was interpreted as a substantive historical alternative to the traditional "bourgeois" state with its key institutions - parliamentarianism, the separation of powers and an independent judicial system. In some current left-oriented theories, this is considered a "model" experiment - successful, consecutive and effective in its initial stage (in the period of the so-called 'War Communism" in 1918-20), but revised and finally rejected in the following period of bureaucratic Communism with its one-party hegemony and Stalinist dictatorship. In order to understand the scientific value of such statements, the author provides a detailed analysis of the principles, initial forms and implications of Soviet labor self-government in the early formation period (1918), using multiple primary sources - the minutes and protocols of central and local labor unions, the old and the new ones, which depict the social, professional, and administrative stratification of Russian revolutionary society during its formation.
   The author's central argument is that the so-called deterioration of labor self-government in Soviet Russia was rooted mainly in the internal transformation of unions as formal organizations rather than external pressure or strategic mistakes. From the very beginning the revolutionary labor unions were different from the typical Western social democratic unions - they had a different, more traditional, social background, and sought a different role in social transformation. A combination of internal and external factors in this transformation created the institutional basis for a new type of social inequality, the development of oligarchic trends in Soviet labor unions, and the formation of a new "labor bureaucracy". The Bolshevist party exploited these trends but did not generate them. In other words, the whole experiment in workers' democracy from its very beginning was profoundly unrealizable and belongs to the museum of human utopian social projects.

AB The article explores the complex research on the law enforcement system and penal repressiveity in the state structures of "White" Russia during the Civil War. The relevance of such a study is due to the dearth of research into historical and legal science, and this article sheds some light on aspects of the history of the national state and law bypassed by scholars for this historical period. The judicial-investigative and prosecutorial authorities, police, and police structures did not cope well with their duties. The reasons for this were low monetary allowances for judges, judicial investigators and prosecutors, employees of state guards, and policemen in the conditions of galloping inflation; the severity and danger of their official activities in conditions of rapid criminalization of public relations; and the impossibility of proper material support for law enforcement agencies. This led to an acute personnel problem. In addition, in the context of political regimes of military dictatorships, the power-management system was militarized, and law enforcement agencies became, in essence, an appendage of the army, which made their work ineffective. The effectiveness of policing was also hampered by a wide range of functional responsibilities assigned to these structures, which resulted in them failing to meet responsibilities. This forced central and local authorities to turn to army units that carried out "white terror," as their actions were characterized by brutality, arbitrariness, and lawlessness.

AB This chapter deals with emerging illiberal challenges-international and domestic-and their impact on the current state and prospects of liberalism, particularly in Russia. Is the liberal world order in peril and, if so, how grave is the threat? Has liberalism really failed ideologically speaking and in terms of policy? As happened during the New Deal, can liberalism in general-and Russian liberalism in particular-be "rebooted" conceptually and programmatically in response to pressing challenges? What are the fundamental issues of the liberal ideological and political agenda that need to be reevaluated? How can modern liberalism be "reset"? These are some of the fundamental issues addressed in this chapter. It provides a tentative typology of today's illiberal challenges, a conceptual differentiation between the institutional and normative aspects of the global liberal world order, an analysis of the political and ideological context that may, at least partly, explain the miseries Russian liberals experience at the present moment, and also a tentative blueprint for the path forward of liberalism in non-liberal Russia.

DE nuclear and missile issue; North Korea; strategic partnership; Korean
   Peninsula; denuclearization
AB The Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea is not going to discuss its nuclear program and is seeking recognition of its de-facto nuclear status. Given that both Russia and China are two responsible nuclear powers, Russian and Chinese positions on the issue are absolutely similar - nuclear North Korea is unacceptable. In terms of security, the DPRK which poses nuclear arsenal should be seen as a threat to the territories of both countries. Nevertheless, Moscow does not fully assess the security risks from Pyongyang because Northeast Asia issues are not in the Russia'sforeign policy focus. The lack of economic interests in the DPRK and the deterioration of U.S. - Russian relations also have a sign cant impact on the formation of Russia's policy in the North Korean direction. China, in its turn, considers the following security risks from Pyongyang's activities. First of all, it is a threat of radiation to the northeast of China in the case of next nuclear test. The second one is a possibility of political-military destabilizing in North-East Asia. And finally, it is the deteriorating of U.S. - Chinese relations, which will negatively affect both the Chinese economy and China's plans to become a world leadership. With regard to the Korean peninsula, in the near future, the positions of Russia and China will increasingly diverge. On this issue, unlike Moscow, Beijing will combine sanctions and pressure tools, as well as opportunities for dialogue with Pyongyang. China's unwillingness to cooperate actively within the framework of the five pally talks (China, Russia, the United States, South Korea and Japan without the DPRK) is only expanding the field for maneuvering for the North Korean regime. The disarmament of North Korea should be considered as an opportunity for cooperation between the five above mentioned countries whose security interests in North-East Asia are converged.

DE Michel Foucault; Western medicine; power; psychiatry; hospital; social
   medicine
AB The article analyzes Michel Foucault's philosophical ideas on Western medicine and delves into three main insights that the French philosopher developed to expose the presence of power behind the veil of the conventional experience of medicine. These insights probe the power-disciplining function of psychiatry, the administrative function of medical institutions, and the role of social medicine in the administrative and political system of Western society. Foucault arrived at theses insights by way of his intense interest in three elements of the medical system that arose almost simultaneously at the end of the 18th century -psychiatry as "medicine for mental illness", the hospital as the first and most well-known type of medical institution, and social medicine as a type of medical knowledge focused more on the protection of society and far less on caring for the individual. All the issues Foucault wrote about stemmed from his personal and professional sensitivity to the problems of power and were a part of the "medical turn" in the social and human sciences that occurred in the West in the 1960s and 1970s and led to the emergence of medical humanities.
   The article argues that Foucault's stories about the power of medical knowledge were philosophical stories about Western medicine. Foucault always used facts, dates, and names in an attempt to identify some of the general tendencies and patterns in the development of Western medicine and to reveal usually undisclosed mechanisms for managing individuals and populations. Those mechanisms underlie the practice of providing assistance, be it the "moral treatment" practiced by psychiatrists before the advent of effective medication, or treating patients as "clinical cases" in hospitals, or hospitalization campaigns that were considered an effective "technological safeguard " in the 18th and most of the 19th century.

AB The Constitution of the Russian Federation in 1993 proclaimed our country a social state. "The Russian Federation is a social state," says Article 7 of the Basic Law, "whose policy is aimed at creating conditions for a decent life ..."
   The Constitution implies that the main goal of a social state is to create conditions that ensure a decent life for all citizens. In addition, the social state, according to the Constitution, is obliged to direct its activities towards the free development of a person, the provision of guarantees for the social protection of the population, and the development of the social sphere.
   Russia in the past two decades, certain attempts have been made to create conditions for improving the lives of citizens. The state has formed a general concept, main directions and priorities of social policy, has created a legislative basis for their implementation. However, the presence in the country of 20 million citizens who are below the poverty line, other arguments and facts show that the political leadership, the government has failed to provide with conditions for a decent life for Russians.

AB The past half century has witnessed major socio-political transformations across the globe. The end of formal European colonialism, basically achieved except for small pockets in the aftermath of the Carnation Revolution in Portugal in 1974, was followed by the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 in parallel to the one of Keynesian organized capitalism in the Northwest and of "state-led development" in much of the South, but also the rise of Asian economies, starting with Japan and now featuring China. The subsequent era of globalization and individualization was short-lived and has given way to the notion of a "multi-polar" globe marked by the at best half-intended withdrawal of the US from hegemony and the loose association of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa under the name of BRICS. What has not changed across this half century is the depletion of the earth's resources and the pollution of the environment. This article retraces the rise of ecological issues to become a global concern, and it does so by relating shifting interpretations of the issue to assignments of political responsibility in the changing global context. Emerging from a comparative research project on Brazil, South Africa and Europe, it draws its examples from these regions, but aims at developing a more general argument about the current impact of historical power asymmetries on ways of dealing with the ecological crisis.

AB Social precarization develops under the influence of objective reasons of digitalization and globalization of economies in various countries. At the same time, it has a specific character of its manifestation in each country, conditioned by cultural, historical, religious, economic, political and other peculiarities of states. The article presents a corporate analysis of the forms of social precarization in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Based on the conducted social research, a difference in the dynamic pattern of the precarization processes in Russia and Kazakhstan has been found. A conclusion has been drawn about the greater intensity of social precarization in Russia compared to Kazakhstan.

AB Political scientists often focus their attention these days on some of the strategies designed to reduce the propensity toward conflict advanced by the authors of 'right-sizing' and 'right-peopling' concepts. This also involves the possibility for allowing such strategies to be applied to the current situation in the Middle East, where the system of nation states is seriously challenged by a number of factors. Particular emphasis is placed by the author upon the modified theory of consocionalism, originally developed by Arendt Lijphart and Gerhard Lembruch in the 1960s, and likewise upon its interpretation by contemporary authors. Certain questions featuring on the agenda, when a choice of available options can be made within the framework of various strategies, such as federalization, are addressed in detail. The practices adopted by different regimes in the Middle East in this respect are reviewed, including relatively successful ones and those that failed to cope with the tasks they faced, with a highlight on their strengths and weaknesses. It is vividly shown that the basic reasons underlying the difficulty in overcoming the conflict intensity and in meeting the challenges to statehood relate to the deeply divided character of Middle Eastern societies, the strong influence of non-governmental actors, the interference of external arbitrators and sectarianization. The problems arising in connection with an inappropriate choice or inadequate use of various strategies are identified. The controversial outcomes of the actions accomplished by the national elites over the recent years are exemplified by Lebanon, and Israel/Palestine, which in the latter case includes the 'defeat of consociation'.

AB There are very different estimations of the Russian 1993 political crisis and international science. Russian scientific evaluations of this crisis have changed substantially since 1993. The aim of this paper is to examine the interdependence between the estimation of the Russian 1993 political crisis and the level of democracy. For this purpose, the authors assigned Russian scientific papers into four separate categories: positive, neutral, negative, and extremely negative The number of the articles in each category was compared with the democracy index for the same time period, and analyzed the results. The percentage of neutral scientific papers was positively correlated with all of the different characteristics of the democracy index, but not with the rank. The reduction of the democracy liberties in Russia was positively correlated with the percentage of negative and extremely negative articles. Political management opportunities are interconnected with stabilization of democracy liberties. (C) 2019 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.

ID TRUTH
AB The concept of transitional justice has been associated with the periods of political change when a country emerges from a war or turmoil and attempts to address the wrongdoings of the past. Among various instruments of transitional justice, truth commissions stand out as an example of a non-judicial form of addressing the crimes of the past. While their setup and operation can be criticized on different grounds, including excessive politization of hearings and the virtual impossibility of meaningfully assessing their impact, it has been widely acknowledged in the literature that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa can be regarded as a success story due to its relatively strong mandate and widespread coverage and resonance it had in South African society. We would like to compare this commission from the 1990s with a more recent example, the Brazilian National Truth Commission, so as to be able to address the question of incorporation of gendered aspects in transitional justice (including examination of sexual violence cases, representation of women in truth-telling bodies, etc.), since gender often remains an overlooked and silenced aspect in such initiatives. Gendered narratives of transitional justice often do not fit into the wider narratives of post-war reconciliation. A more general question addressed in this research is whether the lack of formal procedure in truth commissions facilitates or hinders examination of sexual crimes in transitional settings.

ID SOCIOLOGY
AB The roots and dynamics of the Russian collapse of 1917-1918 provide an occasion for considering the question of the lessons that modern sociology can draw from the "sociology of revolution" of Max Weber and Pitirim Sorokin. This paper reviews the relevance of the approaches demonstrated by Weber's "understanding sociology" and Sorokin's "sociology of factors" on the testing ground of the emergency and confrontation of various forces of the Russian political scene in 1917-1918. Neither Weber nor Sorokin set forth methodological guidelines for their analysis of the Russian revolutions and this paper does not intend to reconstruct their views on the basis of the comparative taxonomies of their categories and concepts. This paper identifies the reasons for the opposing assessments which Weber and Sorokin gave for the causes of the Russian Disorder of 1917-1918 and the consequences they have for their claims to comprehend the revolutionary situation. The paper highlights the circumstances that prompted them to free themselves from obligations to their own theories and to use the authority of science to promote plans for Westernization, i.e. the proposed reconstruction of the political and state institutions of Russia on the model of the leading Entente states. The paper shows that the limits of the Weberian analytical vision of the Russian political scene were due to his consideration of the events in Russia mainly through the question of Russia's further participation in the World War I and its consequences for imperial Germany, while Sorokin's views were constrained by the fact that he represented Russian political positivism and Russian political masonry.

AB The article discusses the security relations among the United States, the EU and Russia in the context of Donald Trump's populism, the change of Western political elites and the erosion of arms treaty regimes. The purpose of the article is to analyze the current state and identify the probable scenarios of relations in the triangle of the USA - the EU - Russia. The article explores the features of the Euro-Atlantic security system from 1990's till the mid-2000's; the concept of Euro-Atlantic security in 2008-2009; the US, the EU and Russia relations under Barak Obama and Donald Trump. As a result of a comprehensive analysis, the author comes to the following conclusions: 1) the concept of Euro-Atlantic security is still relevant. Since the NATO based security arrangements are not stabile, security interaction among the USA, the EU and Russia is growing in importance. 2) European leaders seem to be moving towards building a new security architecture and a more balanced dialogue with Russia. The EU remains the main economic partner of the Russian Federation. 3) Trump's "transactional" approach has prompted Europeans to strengthen its defense identity and seek a compromise with Russia. 4) In a multipolar world, the Euro-Atlantic regional security is no longer closed to transatlantic ties. It is important to rethink the concept towards cooperation with non-regional countries. 5) The complex game of engagement and deterrence is likely to continue in relations between Russia and the West. The more uncertain the transatlantic relations become, the more the EU and the US need Russia.

TI Perestroika and the nineties In Vladimir Bibikhin's hermeneutics

DT Article
DE Bibikhin; Heidegger; Russian history; perestroika; hermeneutics; Russian
   philosophy; ideology; freedom; Platonism
AB The paper provides a reconstruction and a critical analysis of Vladimir Bibikhin's philosophical hermeneutics of Perestroika and the collapse of the USSR as well as political and economic environment in Russia during the "wild nineties". It is argued that the reasons why Bibikhin addressed this issue cannot be fully reduced either to the Russian philosophical tradition, or to Heidegger's notion of the historical factuality of philosophical thinking. Both these intellectual strategies equally influenced Bibikhin's approach towards current political events. Furthermore, various researchers provide opposite interpretations of Bibikhin's reaction to the pressing issues of his time. While Artemy Magun argues that Bibikhin fully shared the political enthusiasm of Perestroika, Mikhail Bogatov discovers Bibikhin's criticism of this enthusiasm. Dealing with a wider range of Bibikhin's texts, one can find a single cause behind the variety of interpretations. This cause is Bibikhin's own complex attitude to the matter. On the one hand, Bibikhin not only criticized the hype of Privatization, which emerged in the nineties, but also was skeptical about the change of the ideology. On the other hand, Bibikhin acknowledged the significance of the current events and urged intellectuals to think about them. Bibikhin believed philosophical work to be the only adequate answer to the unfolding freedom. Therefore, he emphasized the relevance of the Russian philosophical tradition to this task. This is why Bibikhin considered Perestroika and the "wild nineties" to be a new chance to establish Russian philosophy. However, his main goal was to find a non-ideological way of thinking.

TI On Some Methodological Approaches in Legal Research (Philosophical,
   Naturalistic, Positivist Approaches)
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE legal science; methodological approaches; philosophy; naturalism;
   positivism
AB The subject of the research is methodological approaches in legal research. The article deals with the problems associated with the analysis of theoretical and research features, the productivity of some methodological approaches in modem legal research, the scope and relative range of their effective application. The result of the article is historiography, description and methodological assessment of such approaches of the scientific research of legal reality as philosophical, naturalistic and positivist. The methods used include dialectics, comparative analysis, systemic approach, generalization, concretization, historical, logical, functional and comparative legal methods. The findings of the study are as follows. The history of the development of legal science is a history that contains the opposition of different approaches to the understanding of social phenomena such as state and law. Particular attention is paid to these discussions due to the fact that belonging to a certain type of legal understanding is based not only on the theoretical preferences of scholars, but also on ideological and political trends. The philosophical approach to law, within the framework of the present study appealing to a greater extent to the concepts of Kant and Hegel, is not aimed at the analysis of specific norms. It is abstract, speculative, as befits philosophy. It replaces detailed regulation with a universal principle, a universal criterion of law. That is why the philosophical approach is applicable to any theory and any system of law. For all its abstractness, the philosophical approach to law is important for the legislator, for the practicing lawyer, and for any citizen. It, correlated with the ideological component of national development, is the basis of legislation and the application of law, it is indispensable in the assessment, interpretation and improvement of legal norms. As Kant wrote, "the concept of law is a pure but practical concept". The task of the philosophical approach is to identify the fundamental speculative categorical structures, which, acquiring the quality of ideological attitudes, become able to be the basis of legal regulation. Law, based on the naturalistic approach, which is reflected in the legal doctrine of an individual state in the special historical periods of ideological transformation, turns into one of the sections of sociology today, and legal knowledge becomes a kind of sociological, psychological, political or other social knowledge. This factor can be considered both in a negative and in a positive way, since, on the one hand, the specification of legal studies and their special methods of cognition of legal reality is lost, and, on the other hand, the possibility of using universal theoretical and philosophical tools, often quite effective, appears.
   The positivist method of studying law is primarily due to the formal-logical study of legal texts. Knowledge of positive law is carried out on the basis of strictly legal criteria, excluding, for the benefit of "sterilization" of the subject area of jurisprudence, the moral component of the law, as well as the presence of socio-political features. Legal positivism embodies clarity, rigor, evidence of law. According to the representatives of positivism, the purpose of legal science is to consolidate the entire volume of continuously changing and growing legislation, identify and eliminate conflicts in the law. The cognitive orientation of a scholar, combining both critical and self-critical analysis of scientific achievements, seems productive, which, in turn, is due to the amount of knowledge about the quantity and quality of existing methodological approaches in legal research.

AB Dunng the Nazi occupation the Orthodox clergy in Crimea did not remain united in their political views and attitude towards the German invaders. Almost immediately, there were many active supporters of the new regime on the peninsula, includeing some in the political structures of religious lifethere. At the same time, those clergymen who belonged to the Renovationist orientation had pro-Soviet views and could not integrate into the new church-state relations. They identified their main task as saving Jews from the Holocaust, for which many subsequently suffered. Most priests took a cautious and distant position vis-a-vis the invaders and pro-Nazi agitation and propaganda. The main factors in determining loyalty / or opposition relation to the occupation were: national origin, jurisdiction, and experience of repression by the Soviet authorities in the interwar period. Social origin and age did not playa role. After the end of the occupation, representatives of a group of priests loyal to the Nazis were arrested or evacuated with the Germans. The most active pro-Soviet representatives of the clergy did not survive the occupation. The clergy, referred to as the "neutral group," rather calmly perceived the change of power, which had not affected them until the end of the 1940s.

AB This article is devoted to the role of archival heritage in the work of Ukrainian archives while forming historical policy in Ukraine in the period from 2014 to 2019. Having studied official information resources of the archival service of Ukraine and its subordinate Ukrainian archival institutions, the authors analyze the features of the historical policy realized with the archives' help. This allows to better understand an attempt to create a new concept of the Ukrainian history, one that denies positive experience of common historical and cultural heritage of the peoples of Ukraine and Russia. Archival heritage and archival school of Ukraine are among largest and most important in the post-Soviet space. However, the period from 2014 to 2019 is characterized by a radical change in the vector of development of Ukraine, which affected not just foreign policy and economy, but humanitarian sphere as well. In particular, this turn has manifested itself in a purposeful escalation of confrontation with Russia and in anti-Russian narrative. This policy has also affected the activities of the Ukrainian archives and the Ukrainian archival service, as they have become an important element in its development. There is a series of documents publications, archival exhibitions, and archivists' and archive managers' interviews to prove this. Although the recent developments have hindered the cooperation of Russian and Ukrainian historians and archivists, the Russian specialists and the Rosarkhiv continue to study the history of Ukraine, to introduce new sources into scientific use, to counter falsification of history and disjunction of historical memory of the peoples of Russia and Ukraine. The authors note that a deep and objective understanding of the historical past of Ukraine is impossible without cooperation with Russian historians and archivists and express their hope that scientific approaches and methods will prevail over the short-term political conjuncture.

TI The problem of urbanization in Northern Rus'
SO STUDIA SLAVICA ET BALCANICA PETROPOLITANA
LA Russian
DT Editorial Material
DE Early Middle Ages; Northern Rus'; urbanization; basic concepts;
   archaeological data; protocities; administrative centers
AB In the 1990s the idea that proximity to trade routes was the main driving force of the process of urbanization of early medieval Rus' again became dominant in Russia. But speaking of "trade," as applied to the Viking Age, it is easy to fall into modernization. There was no "free trade" then. In order not to be sold into slavery, the merchant had to be protected by a society with authority in international affairs. It is from this perspective that one should consider the evidence of craft and trade preserved in the layers of early urban settlements. The combination of administrative-organizational and trade-craft factors in their functional spectrum is a key problem to be developed. An important aspect of the problem of urbanization is the study of the socio-cultural and economic base on which cities grew. The process of formation of Slavic central places in the Northwest Russia, which began in the 7th - 8th centuries, was interrupted during the Viking Age. The first "proto-cities" usually appeared in new places. Even where the continuity between the "hillfort" and the "city" was really revealed, the guarantee of this was either a socio-political cataclysm, or the inclusion of this item in the zone of new influence. In itself, the development of local centers can't be identified with urbanization. The latter meant a radical change in the structure of archaic East European societies. The beginning of movement along the military trade routes, the arrival of Arab silver to the north opened up unprecedented prospects for the implementation of the tributes and products of trade exchange collected in the north. It was then that the first "proto-cities" emerged. The materials of the earliest Ladoga indicate that the beginning of the mass marketing of craft products to the rural population occurred already at the late 8th - early 9th centuries. For example, the production of glass according to the Eastern recipe was established there for the subsequent production of beads, which were the currency in the purchase of furs. This meant that by the end of the 8th century a fairly stable supply of the necessary components of the technological process from the Middle East was established. This did not testify to individual "trade", but to the purposeful exploitation of the adjacent territories. One can interpret such kind of central places as administrative and organizational centers of a new type. They should not be confused with either "cities" or "rural places": this is a special phenomenon in the social culture of Early Middle Ages. Its appearance was impossible without breaking the previous hierarchy of values, authorities, sacred ties. So one shouldn't be surprised that "smooth continuity" of old and new centers is not observed. Not tribes and ethnic composition but, first of all, social roles were changed (although an influx of paramilitary contingent from the north actually took place). Proto-cities became the epicenters of the formation of new elite and new, Old Rus' cultural traditions, which then quickly spread to the rural area.

SO MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE special path; modernization; ideology; institutional structures; path
   dependence; institutional scars; individualism-paternalism; collectivism
   from above; collectivism from below
AB The ideas about Sonderweg in any given country (the idiosyncratic path of a country's development) typically lead to specific theoretical constructions. Such ideas usually emerge when society accumulates concern about its backwardness with respect to its neighbors, or experiences frustration after a failed attempt to modernize by borrowing institutions from more successful countries. In the latter cases, it is often ignored that borrowed institutions evolved in donor countries as a result of a long evolutionary development constituting these countries' own Sonderweg. This article attempts three things: (1) to identify the ideologeme of Sonderweg and its role in socio-economic, political and ideological processes in Russia; (2) to highlight the features of the historical, geographical, cultural and socio-economic situation that underlie the "specifics" of Russia's development; (3) to offer insights on how to overcome path dependence and the barriers that hinder modernization.
   The article shows that often it is the state that imposes the ideologeme of Sonderweg on society and uses it for its own political purposes. At the same time, it is stressed that it is difficult to build a path towards real modernization, especially in the modern information world, since this path must take into account the "institutional seam" of previous aborted attempts to modernize. In this context, the state has a prominent role to play; and it is required to take a flexible approach to solving current problems, not through over- regulation of all processes, which results in a monopoly of collectivism "from above", but by encouraging the initiatives of society itself, creating independent organizations, which for many individuals turn out to be manifestations of collectivism "from below" or, in other words, factors in the building of civil society". The harmonious relationship between the state and civil society underlies the well-being of modern developed countries.

AB Transport plays an important role in regional development. Transport communications provide connectivity of the territory, reduce the cost of doing business, increase the comfort of living of the population, etc. Of importance is the development of transport for the Russian Federation, as a country with the maximum area in the world. Due to the poor development of transport, many of its regions have a low level of socio-economic development. Railway transport in Russia in connection with the economic and geographical features of the country is the most important factor ensuring the functioning of the economic system of the country and its regions. The article considers its influence on regional development (on the example of Russia). Of particular importance is the economic analysis of the possibility of attracting private investment in transport projects. And these projects themselves are proposed to be evaluated in the economic, social, environmental and political aspects.

DT Article
DE the Balkans; the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; 1999 NATO aggression;
   international-legal; military strategic and geopolitical consequences of
   the aggression; world politics
AB On March 24, 1999, on the pretext of protecting human rights NATO began its aggression against a sovereign European state - the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Historically, it was the first military strike against a sovereign state in response not to external aggression, but to internal conflict. The escalation of the Kosovo conflict to the scale of a "humanitarian intervention" raised a sharp question about not only the contours and principles of the 21st century world system, but also about the limits of the functionality of supranational (first and foremost force) structures. The NATO aggression had both short-term and long-term consequences. The article analyzes three groups of consequences: international- legal, military strategic and geopolitical. In the analysis of international-legal consequences, we investigated the process of legitimation of "humanitarian intervention" and "responsibility to protect". In the analysis of military strategic consequences, the emphasis is given to the processes and procedures of the transformation of the Serbian army into a dysfunctional system and the creation of conditions for accession of the Republic to NATO. Since Serbia is the central element of the Balkan policy of Western countries and organizations, the question is extremely important. Geopolitical consequences of the aggression we analyzed through the prism of political technologies of political coups tested in Serbia in October 2000 and used later in different regions of the world. The study is preceded by a short historiographical review of the latest literature on the topic. The conducted multilevel analysis of the consequences of the NATO aggression in 1999 gives an opportunity to formulate fundamentally new conceptual foreign policy approaches of modern Russia foreign policy.

DT Article
DE hajj; French Algeria; French expedition to Egypt
AB The pilgrimage to the holy places of Islam in Mecca and Medina - the Hajj - is an integral part of the religious duty of Muslims, one of the pillars of Islam. It is supposed to be carried out at least once in a lifetime by every Muslim. However, the hajj has always been a difficult undertaking, since a pilgrim had to make a long and physically difficult journey, especially if his journey began from regions remote from Mecca. Beginning from 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt and further as French colonial influence in North Africa expanded, the issue of the French attitude towards the hajj and the need to support it by the French administration raise up again and again. And if in Egypt the hajj was immediately supported by the administration of Napoleon Bonaparte, then in Algeria, the conquest of which began in 1830, the first organization of the hajj was undertaken by the colonial administration only in 1842. In this article the author examines a complex of issues connected with the discussions about and ways of organizing hajj by the French conquerors in North Africa during the Egyptian campaign (1798-1801) and the first two decades of the conquest of Algeria (1830-1850). The organization of the Hajj in the conquered territories pursued purely rational, political goals. Interaction with Islamic institutions was necessary for the French establishment as part of the integration of vast territories with the Muslim population into the French imperial space.

TI Spatial Imaginary in "Western" Travelogues about Russia
SO CHANGING SOCIETIES & PERSONALITIES
LA English
DT Article
DE spatial imaginary; modernity; travelogue; Russia; travel narrative
AB Travel literature provides the readers with access to the most remote places but also reproduces the so-called "traveler's gaze", thus connecting and separating people at the same time. Through individual travel narratives globalization processes get inscribed into an individual identity of the author and the reader. This article analyzes how Russia is presented in three travelogues written by American journalists: Andrew Meier (2003); David Greene (2014); and Anne Garrels (2016). These narratives are considered by focusing on the three dichotomies, around which the characteristics of modern societies are constructed: centre/periphery, past/present, and political/individual. Russia's trajectory of modernity, according to Western travelogues, is predominantly oriented towards the country's past - the legacy of the Soviet Union and Russian Empire, which means that virtually no place is left for the "future", associated with democratization, liberalization, individualization, and environmental awareness. As the narrators see it, the centre's priority is to maintain control over the periphery and to hold the country together at any cost, which makes all other considerations, including the well-being of the people, secondary. Therefore, there is a constant struggle between the political and the individual, with people seeking to protect their private worlds from the encroaching power of the government.

DE migration policy; Russia; compatriots; labor migrants; educational

AB The article discusses the socio-economic and demographic role of immigration for the development of modern Russian society. There is a significant compensatory contribution of immigration to the reduction of the population of Russia, the formation of a general increase in the population of the country and individual regions. The scales and structure of the main migration flows to Russia are analyzed, including migration to a permanent place of residence, temporary labor and educational migration. It touches upon the historical aspects of the migration policy in the Russian Empire during the reign of Catherine II in the context of the formation of the migration policy of modern Russia. The key problems of the formation and functioning of the Russian migration policy are highlighted, including the incompatibility of migration practices with conceptual ideas, as well as the absence of a humanitarian approach in migration services. The necessity of transferring the migration management system from power space to the economic field on the basis of the humanitarian component is substantiated. There are six main directions of the necessary optimization of migration policy, primarily in terms of migration practices, based on the principle of its humanization in the interests of society and people. There is a problem of access of migrants to registration at the place of stay, which is periodically tightened and raises problems for the legal status of migrants in Russian society. Russian society also needs adaptation and integration programs that will have real and sufficient funding from the federal, regional and local budgets. The necessity of creating a specialized service for migration management and the implementation of key areas of migration policy in the Russian Federation is substantiated. The article concluded that the inhuman and imperfect migration policy of Russia is becoming a kind of "stumbling block" for the socio-economic and demographic development of Russian society. Changing the approach to managing migration from control and administrative to socio-economic pragmatism based on the humanitarian component will allow the country to make a breakthrough in development. The sociocultural risks that migration carries for Russia are minimal, since the majority of migrants come from the countries of the former single political and socio-economic space, speak Russian, have work motivation and a desire to be part of Russian society.

AB The article mainly concentrates on the state religious policy of the middle of the 18th century - the least studied period in the process of formation of Russian religious tolerance in the early Modern Time. An ideological, political and legal controversy that accompanied the process of re-emigration of old believers to Russia and, accordingly, the formation of relative religious freedoms in Russia during the 1750 - 1790-ies, investigated for the first time in historiography. The author characterizes the main approaches to the re-emigration of old believers at the top on the basis of unknown archival materials. Most attention is paid to the enlightenment foundations for the interpretation of re-emigration related to understanding state interests and manifested during the period of active work of the Legislative Board of Empress Elizabeth (1754-1766). As a result, the author points that the southern program of Supreme power for the return of the old believers reflected the slow evolution of the Russian political system as a European (continental) tolerant monarchy.

AB The article presents proven methodological approaches of traditional ethnic entrepreneurship forms study. The author stands on the positions of primordialism and considers the of ethnic entrepreneurship phenomenon on the base of fractal and network organization concepts. Ethnic entrepreneurship manifestations in the urban and rural environment are proposed to be considered in an organic relationship, as a process, that allows ethnos adaptation potential realization at all levels of social organization of ethnic minorities (from "households" to large trading firms), on the one hand. And, to integrate the primary institutions of the ethnos (fractals) into the system of regional and interregional economic (market) ties without the threat of losing ethnic identity, on the other hand. Special attention is paid to the ethnic economy place in the structure of ethnic processes (migration, adaptation, integration, consolidation, assimilation). This methodological approach allows us to consider ethnic entrepreneurship as a traditional economy structural element and a sociocultural phenomenon in statics. So, it is in dynamics, - as a manifestation of a multicomponent, hierarchically coordinated and latent (in form) process. According to the author, the actual ethnic economy should be attributed to the ethnic processes group. This allows you to expand the subject field of research in the field of social and applied anthropology (ethnology) significantly; to reach the level of scientific forecasting of the mechanism of interaction and interdependence of ethno-political and socio-economic processes.

   Conference on African Development (TICAD); Asia-Africa Growth Corridor
   (AAGC); "Belt and Road" initiative (BRI); UN
AB The article discusses motives and directions of Japan-China rivalry in the largest regions of the developing world (DW) - Africa and Latin America (LA).
   Foreign economic interests of Japan and China largely coincide, and that logically creates basis for competition. Both countries suffer urgent need for energy resources, seek to diversify their finished products' markets and to secure their hydrocarbon imports.
   The author describes in detail the strengths and weaknesses of the two countries in their cooperation with Africa and LA and emphasizes that, although Japan has a number of valuable advantages, China, thanks to its special financial, economic, and diplomatic assertiveness, retains undoubted leadership in the struggle for influence in the DW. The volume of Japanese trade and economic cooperation with the DW is significantly inferior to the Chinese one, but the country is taking significant steps to mitigate this situation both independently and in reliance on the partnership with other states, including India.
   In the political sphere, the rivalry between the two countries in the DW is caused by their strong divergence of views on territorial problems in the East and South China seas, on the issue of the UN reform, including Japan's permanent membership in the UN Security Council, and by mutual historical "grievances" as well. China and Japan wage sharp, though veiled struggle in the UN and other international structures for the voices of developing countries. And the political sphere is the one where China perceives Japan as a highly influential regional and global competitor.
   The author also points out a special vector of confrontation between Japan and China in the DW generated by the neighborhood of their military and logistics bases in Africa (Djibouti), parallel participation in international security activities, including provision of peaceful navigation on the sea routes along the East African coast, and the expansion of their naval presence in the Indian ocean.
   Finally, the article notes that Japan has to go a long way to achieve positions in the DW comparable to the Chinese ones. At the same time, the author characterizes a number of advantages that Japan possesses in comparison with China, and emphasizes that the nearest though achievable task for Tokyo in Africa and Latin America is to maintain and maximize these advantages. With the skillful approach peculiar to Japan especially in difficult times, it may become a key decision.

AB The paper examines the characteristic features and problems of the Russian reception of Hannah Arendt's philosophy. Its first part contains a brief description of the history of publications on Arendt, from the late Soviet period till now. Describing the main topics in Arendt studies in Russia, this part also focuses on Russian translations of Arendt's works. While most of Arendt's major works have been translated as of now, many of the Russian editions are suffering from a lack of quality, caused by both objective and subjective factors. The second part presents a thematic analysis of Russian reception of Arendt's ideas. The authors point out that, because of the mostly fragmentary character of Russian Arendt studies and the lack of fundamental publications, Arendt's name is still associated with many stereotypes. Although some of Arendt's concepts are slowly turning obsolete due to methodological reasons, the future of the Arendt studies in Russia holds a great potential in the field of political and social philosophy, philosophical anthropology and philosophy of emotion.

TI POWER: ON THE ISSUE OF DEFINING IT
SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE power; power as a social phenomenon; power in the system of politics;
   philosophy of power; axiology of power
AB Among the phenomena having the social nature, the power is the phenomenon providing institutionalization and designing of structure and the system of the organization of society. It sets not only the levels of institutionalizing, but also the levels of the relationship influencing the tradition per se, its ethic and legal system. The power, being initially individual and public "institute", also forms two types of standard institutionalization - axiological eschatological system and civil and political (etatist) system, which provides several types of hierarchization and subordination: generic / specific and hierocratic, implemented in the history as ethnocultural national tradition.
   Thus, the power as a functional and institutional phenomenon represents itself as a reproduction process the essence of which is realization of sacralization, codification, legitimation and management principles. All this in complex also defines the status of the power - its place in the social system which also has direct expression in the image of its sender - the actor/subject acting on its behalf.
   While analyzing the phenomenon of power, namely the volume and the essence of this notion the article emphasizes/highlights its qualitative semantic (genetic) characteristic - alienation, which at the same time serves as the fundamental platform for forming the sovereign - "I" (subjectivity). The nature of "alienation" as the basic function is unique in its ability to reveal, provide manifestation of universals and/or categories, the most basic of which are binomials, such as: "being and nothingness", "sacred - profane", "spiritual - material", "ideal - real", "The god / Absolute - a person", "transcendent - transcendental / immanent", "the power - a right / duty", "one whole - concrete / individual", "common - private", etc.
   The hypothesis is made that it is due to this "natural" similarity that processes of sacralization/clericalisation of power and religization of policy, as well as ideologization and politicization (etatization) of religion, occur (being, in fact, defamation of each category) if the institutes of science and education do not provide the onto-axiological grounds, and legislative and law enforcement agencies do not provide separation of powers and development of civil and state processes and institutes.
   In conclusion, the following author's definition is put forward: power is the actor's ability to alienate the right of self-determination in favor of a subject of a higher level, for the purpose of distribution of powers for all types of the actors forming the system (society). In the course of delegation and social interaction the power gains the nature of the dynamic institutional system which is in a condition of continuous development. This system within an episteme appears as well as the function providing dialectic unity of the elements by means of continuous communication through sacralization/coercion, legitimation/defamation, certification (sanction)/restriction.

AB The article touches upon the issue of the new cultural policy of sustainable development of traditional cultures in the context of globalization. The article is also devoted to the system analysis of intercultural conflicts at the level of the necessary structuring of public consciousness in economic, political and aesthetic expression. The various forms of interaction between a person and society are shown. The transformation of such levels as the level of democracy, freedom, responsibility, a set of moral values leads to a change in social consciousness. The movement of time, which is considered to be a casual attribution of values, relies on them as a permanent category, correcting the uncertainty about the future of society, including the mechanisms of evolution of creative individuality along with historical and cultural processes. In addition, the article examines the spiritual value orientation of the functioning of traditional cultures in the formation of a new Russian cultural and civilizational picture of the world as "the integration of differences". The relevance of national ideological and aesthetic originality is considered by the authors of the research as a dialectical, contradictory historical and cultural process. The authors of the article also argue that the return to universal spiritual values is a real opportunity to confront the "alien" modern social myths under the conditions of systemic crisis of culture in the context of economic modernization (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

DE Byzantium; Constantinople; Holy Roman Empire; 10th-century diplomacy;
   diplomatic practice; Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus; Liudprand the
   bishop of Cremona
AB Introduction. The article aims to compare two texts concerning byzantine diplomatic practices of the mid 10th century. The first one is described in the 13th chapter of the treatise "De Administrando Imperio", in which its author Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus gave some pieces of advice to his son Romanus II Porphyrogenitus how to line up rhetorical manipulation during the negotiations with ambassadors of different `barbarian' nations. The second one is the description of conversation, which took place on September 17, 968 between emperor Otto I the Great's ambassador bishop Liudprand of Cremona and patrician Christopher. It is described in Liudprand's "Relatio de Legatione Constantinopolitana". Methods. The classical comparative method is used to examine the veracity of two independent texts of different character describing the similar diplomatic trick. The author compares a program-ideological and simultaneously a propaedeutic treatises with a semiofficial report of a foreign senior ambassador. Analysis. In the 13th chapter of the treatise "De Administrando Imperio" its author Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus advised his son Roman II in negotiations with the ambassadors of the "barbarian" nations not to except the precedent of giving in marriage the granddaughter of the Byzantine emperor Romanus I Lecapenus Maria-Irina to Bulgarian ruler Peter, since Romanus I Lecapenus was a man of poor education and incompetent in the ancient sacred customs of the Roman Empire. In "Relatio de Legatione Constantinopolitana" by bishop Liudprand of Cremona during the confiscation of "purple clothes", which he had bought, he referred to the fact that during his last visit to Constantinople, emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus had allowed him to take out even more expensive clothes without any obstacles. Contrary to this example, he received a reply from patrician Christopher, that emperor Constantine was a weak man and cherished the friendship of barbarians and foreigners with gifts, and ruling emperor Nikephoros II Phokas was a strong and warlike man, he didn't allow such liberties for foreigners. In both cases, the same counter-argument was used to disavow precedent - a criticism of the bygone emperor in comparison with the current sovereign. This suggests that it was a common rhetorical device for Byzantine diplomats. These two cases allow to clarify the sophisticated ideology of "Tradition" and its "Split" as a corner-stone political idea of Eastern Roman Empire. Results. As a result of comparing the texts "De Administrando Imperio" (952-959) and "Relatio de Legatione Constantinopolitano" (969) it becomes clear that Byzantine politicians in the mid 10th century used for disavowing diplomatic precedents the criticism of their own emperor, who agreed to some concessions in the past. His personality was declared inappropriate to the high standards of a Roman ruler in comparison with the current emperor. Such rhetoric was surprising for the peoples who considered a series of their rulers as a genealogical aggregate of relatives responsible for their predecessors as for themselves. Byzantine politicians calmly recognized imperfections of their bygone emperors, what allowed them to ignore the strongest diplomatic argument of the early Middle Ages - a historical precedent.

ID DEMOCRACY
AB As a result of intensive international debate and the adoption of a number of renowned international anticorruption conventions and initiatives in the 1990s and 2000s, the issue of corruption has become a convenient theme for different kinds of generalizations in social sciences. However, national legislation does not reflect these developments in its legal regulation due to conservatism inherent in jurisprudence.
   One of the most evident gaps in this respect is the sphere of political corruption. While political science and political economy for decades have been successful in explaining political processes in different countries as corrupt conspiracies of political elites, business structures, and other actors in the political process, legal science has kept itself separate from such problems and prefers to deal with individual acts of corruption. But if for criminal law such an approach seems logical due to the methodology of the criminal law, for other branches of law which set forth a systemic view on social processes - primarily administrative and constitutional - there seems to be an omission.
   Nowadays, there is a quite favourable environment for the development of a consistent legal understanding of anticorruption in Russia. This has become possible thanks to current Russian administrative reforms, when the need fora highly professional bureaucracy led to a greater demand for various anticorruption mechanisms. The next possible step in Russia may be an attempt to ensure the effectiveness of well-proven anti-corruption methods of the political system as a whole.
   In this article we propose a brief background to the evolution of the concept of political corruption in Western and Russian political and legal science, which entails the necessity of complex scientific legal synthesis on this issue, allows to discuss the existing methodological potential and creates new opportunities to build up appropriate systemic legislative models.

AB The article discusses the concept of distributed cognition and actualizes the issue of the limits of its application. The issue relates to the situations of the production of scientific knowledge and expertise, which becomes the basis for political decision-making. The purpose of the article is to show that the extension of distributed scientific cognition to the field of public science communication, where the interaction of experts and non-experts is realized, is not only possible, but also necessary. As parts of this purpose, the following steps are taken. First, I briefly describe the concept of public science communication characterizing not only the dissemination of knowledge outside the scientific community, but also the participation of the public in its production. Secondly, at the conceptual level I argue that the scientific character of knowledge can be saved in the communication of scientists with the public, since the concept of objectivity as a basic scientific value includes the requirement to extend the context of the knowledge relevance and the number of participants of its production. Thirdly, I demonstrate that the extension of distributed cognition to the field of communication of scientists with the public is necessary in situations of uncertainty and distribution of techno-scientifically produced risks. The situations require cognitive abilities and cognitive tasks additional to those provided by science. This allows to talk about the extension of distributed scientific cognition to the field of public science communication. This study may be relevant for scientists entering public science communication and forming a relationship to it, as well as in general, for the practices of social and political interactions in which socially important decisions are made.

DT Article

   relations; basic agreements
AB The author traces the stages of Russian- Hungarian relations over three "post-Soviet" decades. The author argues that despite the general background of dismantling the past, all countries of the region have been developing different patterns of relations with Russia. . The main feature of Russian-Hungarian relations at the first stage was the ideological context, the shadow of the events of 1956, the issues of restitution, and Finno-Ugric kinship. By the beginning of the 21st century, the relations as a whole had acquired the pragmatic character that dominates until now. Since the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, the Russian factor has become an integral element of Hungarian political life. his circumstance is not affected by the change of governments. The authorities seek to benefit from economic cooperation with Russia. Once in opposition, they become methodical critics of the ruling Cabinet - whether socialists or conservatives. Finally, in 2010, the Hungarian policy towards Russia for the first time in modern history finds a conceptual basis such as the "opening to the East" policy. Hungary constantly claims that anti-Russian sanctions are harmful and merciless, and seeks to strike new deals with Russia even if it can undermine its own image in the EU. Finally, Hungary was the first European country to receive an official visit from Russian President after the EU sanctions were imposed. Nevertheless, Budapest prefers Euro-Atlantic loyalty and don't oppose at the EU level the anti-Russian sanctions extension. The author concludes that despite the absence of a strategy towards Russia, the personal sympathies of the leaders of the two countries and economic interests have been contributing to the ongoing development of bilateral relations for almost two decades.

DT Article
DE social form; political form; converted form; institution; semiotic
   phenomenon; causative force; sociality; interdisciplinary analysis
AB The article develops the theme of the political form, the discussion of which started on the pages of the Journal of Politeia in 2012-2016, and contains a conceptual elaboration of a more general concept of the social form. The author builds her model around the interdisciplinary concept of sociality, which treats the latter as a supraspecific phenomenon. In general terms, social form is defined as a sign complex, through which this or that type of interaction is realized. Social form represents a special class of social interactions and specifies them on such grounds as stability and repeatability of the external configuration of interactions; materiality; invariance of structural components; integrity. Social life is organized along two key types of forms. The first type includes elementary (ethological) social forms that are in principle common for a human being and other social animals. The second type includes institutional forms that are specific for human communities. In contrast to an ethological form, which is regarded as a stable way of social interactions independent of individual interpretation that are realised as a system of statuses / roles, a social institution is a system of statuses / roles that has a reflexive form. A promising area of the analysis of institutional phenomena, including political institutions, is their interpretation from the perspective of a converted form. Scientific researchers are interested in the category of social form largely due to its inherent causative force. Being a semiotic phenomenon, social form is built as one or another semantic complex and thereby is imposed upon the subject. Both elementary and institutional forms, "simple" as well as converted, possess a causative force.

DT Article
DE economic crisis; attribution of responsibility; political institutions;
   accountability; effectiveness of authority
ID PRESIDENTIAL POPULARITY; PERFORMANCE; DEMOCRACY; SUPPORT
AB Should public authorities be blamed for the economic downturn and its consequences? If so, which political authorities in particular are singled out and which escape from being held accountable? We assume that the basis for the observed gap between the worsening economic conditions and the approval ratings of the president, the government, and the parliament is the mechanism of responsibility attribution: the ability of citizens to identify decision-making centers and link the implemented policy to the changes in living conditions. Lack of cognitive resources, institutional opaqueness, and the poor quality of politically relevant information can hamper the accurate attribution of blame, with corresponding effects of the evaluation of performance. Our data show that collective bodies with unpopular politicians, such as the State Duma and the government, are given the lion's share of the blame for the deterioration in living standards. In comparison with them, the president is perceived to be the winner and thereby avoids blame for the crisis in the economy. At the same time, the study shows a high level of citizen frustration and dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of public authorities, in particular the low responsiveness of state institutions. The failure to accurately attribute blame, in turn, poses a serious danger to the authorities' accountability and policy changes. Without a clear understanding of who takes responsibility for particular political decisions, one cannot be sure whom to blame for poor policies. Obviously, in such a case, not only 'institutional clarity' in the distribution of powers, but also the quality of the media environment, will play a major part, given its mediating role on responsibility attribution.

TI GOVERNING THE DEAD: DISCIPLINE AND BIOPOLITICS

LA Russian
DT Article
DE discipline; biopower; body; death; concentration camp; cremation;
   burial; embalming
AB The analysis of practices applied to the body of dominated subjects-their spatial disposition, military drills, corporal punishment and execution-occupies an important place among Michel Foucault's theories. This article provides an analysis of practices that are not governed by any ritual but by the dominant political mechanisms as those practices are applied to dead bodies. In other words, the logic of Foucault's analysis is extended to the dead body, in particular to that of a political prisoner.
   The dead body, as well as the living one, is arguably located at the intersection of two types of power described by Foucault: disciplinary power and biopolitics. On the one hand, the corpse is the focus of disciplinary mechanisms that seek to identify and individualize it, and also to prevent it from dissolving into the mass of other anonymous corpses that have completely exhausted their potential for use. On the other hand, the inmate's body can be subjected to more radical, massifying, and anonymizing practices that treat it as part of a population to be exterminated. The paper analyzes two ways of treating the corpse: cremation and burial. In the 20th century, the ritual significance of cremation and burial has been replaced by a political one, especially when they are used as repressive measures applied to the corpse of an inmate that died in a concentration or labor camp. In terms of their political meaning, these two practices are not at all equivalent.

AB The problem of formation and development of the system of training the scientific personnel in Bashkiria in 1960-1980s is considered. The relevance of the study is determined by the lack of study of this problem in regional historiography. Previously unpublished statistical information about graduate school (own and target) is for the first time introduced into scientific circulation. At the same time other forms of training are characterized: internship, doctoral studies, etc. The growth in the number of students in graduate school off the job and on the job, graduated in the postwar years until 1990, is analyzed. The comparative analysis of regional data with the all Soviet Union data on the composition of graduate students, taking into account specialties and branches of science, the changes in indicators during the period under review are shown. It is concluded that the predominance of graduate students in technical sciences was due to the peculiarities of socio-economic, socio-political, cultural and historical development of both the Republic and the country as a whole. Regional features in the development of the system of training of scientific personnel in Bashkiria in these years are commented. The article also touches upon the problem of efficiency of post-graduate studies, which remains relevant today.

   policy; international relations; crisis in Syria
ID TURKEY
AB Turkey and Iran are two Middle Eastern neighbors building their relationship on the basis of competition and cooperation. Both countries aim at the position of regional leader and want to offer their own "model" of development to the Middle East. Historical neighborship has provided Turkey and Iran not only with the experience of struggle for influence, but an ability to interact in the spheres of overlapping interests as well. Turmoil in the Middle East attracts the attention of researchers to the issue of Turkish-Iranian relations. The article deals with the key areas of regional relations of the two countries reflecting their efforts to keep the power balance though they have contradicting interest. Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 has put Turkish and Iranian "models" in adversary positions to one another emphasizing religion vs secularism.
   The Turkish side has broadened the range of its instruments after Justice and Development Party coming to power in Ankara, although its aim remains to be the promotion of Western concepts in the Middle East. The Party's strategy to expand Turkish influence in the region takes into account the Ottoman heritage, which modern Ankara seeks to popularize in order to reinforce its claims to regional leadership. The competitive arsenal of the Turkish leadership includes historical ties with the peoples of the region and the experience of the Europeanization of the Muslim state.
   Iran is promoting its vision of Muslim democracy, positioning itself as a staunch fighter against the expansionism of the West and, despite the decline in warlike rhetoric, does not refuse to export the values of the Islamic revolution. Ankara is at odds with Western countries on private issues or methods, but generally it shares the same strategic approaches. Tehran, on the contrary, rejects the ideological rapprochement with the West and the borrowing of Western development models, advocating maintaining its own path. In fact, Iran and Turkey offer Middle Eastern countries alternative political transformation options.
   Iraq and Syria represent both the sphere of Turkish-Iranian competition and the possibility for tactical alignment on the basis of converging interests. The events of recent years have demonstrated that at the times when the Turkey and Iran sense common threats, they put their contradictions on the back burner. Pragmatism and rivalry in Turkish-Iranian relations are not alternatives but exist in parallel as a way of maintaining a regional balance of power between the two countries. This explains the ability of Ankara and Tehran to seek compromises. At the same time, the various approaches of these states to the future structure of the Middle East region will continue to hinder the creation of a stable alliance between them. These realities must be taken into account when assessing the prospects for the development of the regional situation and the potential of Turkish-Iranian relations, the study of which is especially important for Russia, taking into account trilateral cooperation to resolve the crisis in Syria.

TI ONCE AGAIN ON THE MEANING OF THE TERM "HORDE" AND THE CATEGORIES "GOLDEN
   HORDE", "WHITE HORDE", "BLUE HORDE"
SO ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Jochid Ulus; Golden Horde; White Horde; Blue Horde; semantic
AB Research objectives: This article discusses some issues related to the problem of the relationship between the concepts of the "Golden Horde", the "White Horde", and the "Blue Horde", with an emphasis on the term "horde" itself - both as a scientific definition and as a historical concept related to the phonetic forms in which it situated in the sources. The author proposes to reveal the original meaning of the term ordo similar to orda and to outline the stages of expansion of its semantics with the delineation of semantic fields.
   Research materials: The article may be considered largely as a kind of commentary on the research of recent years. Since all materials on the affected issues have been known to researchers for a long time, the selection of sources looks proverbially traditional. These are Mongolic, Chinese, Latin, Muslim (Arabic and Persian), and Old Russian texts containing the word ordo in its various forms. The author did not use the whole body of sources, but rather the most illustrative materials in his opinion. Mostly, the linguistic material was employed which comprises the lexical basis for researching specific languages.
   Research results and novelty: In the process of researching the contexts of using of the term ordo similar to orda in various sources and different orthographic variants (corresponding to phonetic ones), the author came to the following contention. Secondary senses reflecting one of the aspects of the original sense evolved from the basic meaning recorded among thirteenth-century Mongols - "the abiding-place of a ruler, his family, his entourage, and all the attendants". Since the development took place in parallel, this did not exclude the words being used with different intended meanings in the same texts, which can be revealed only as a result of the analysis of the context. The contexts of the use of the term in the sources make it possible to assert that there was a process of expansion of the term's original meaning, reflected in the perception of different authors being representatives of foreign cultures. This occurs in the period after the middle of the fourteenth century, being directly caused by the events of political history of the Jochid ulus as it was plunged into an era of trouble. Also, the emergence of additional senses associated with the concept of territory was the result of a comprehension of the word in related contexts within the worldview specific for sedentary cultures. The author of the article accepts the point to identity the terms "Golden Horde" and "White Horde", both contrasted with the concept "Blue Horde", originally associated respectively with the designation of the domains of the descendants of Batu in the western part, and the descendants of Urdu in the eastern part, of the Jochid ulus. In addition, it is recognized that the hypothesis on the correlation of these color markers with the traditional geosymbolism of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples is not sufficiently substantiated although it is theoretically permissible. The fact that the term ordo similar to orda with both color markers of "gold" and "white" was more often associated with the sense "qan's tent", corresponds with the source data on similar epithets for tents of different qans. Historically, the possession of such tent was typical for certain leaders, at least in the Mongolian tradition, but from an early age it had come to be claimed as the attribute of the rulers of the Jochid ulus primarily. Nonetheless, a solid identification of the relationship between the concepts "golden" and "white" requires special research.

AB The paper discusses the semantic models that determine the practice of the Russian translation of the key terminology of Karl Marx, as well as the ensuing consequences of choosing a simplifying interpretational strategy for such a translation and determining its political pragmatics. This strategy is a request for a scientific concept that rejects the prospect of capitalist development, as well as the goals of propaganda and political education. The terms der Wen (value), dos Wending (valuable thing), die Wengegenstandlichkeit (value objectivity) were translated as "cost" in the canonical translation, enshrined in the publication of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism (1937). At the same time, two fundamentally different aspects of the product der Gehrauchswert (value as utility is a quality characteristic, not quantifiable) and der Tauschwert (exchange value, the ability to proportionally exchange) were translated, respectively, as use cost and exchange cost. This interpretation formed the basis of discursive practices in education, social sciences, journalism, and media. use "value" translation versions were actually removed from scientific use. however, the "cost paradigm" significantly reduces the analysis of market relations and contexts. This is confirmed by the appeal to the original texts of the first and second editions of "Capital". Discussions regarding the transfer of K. Marx's terminology in "Capital" are not only instructive, but have important perspectives. Nowadays, the question has grown beyond the scope of a word dispute. The failure of value-to-value reduction is manifested in the problems of neoliberalistic marginalism, the coming to the fore social and cultural (neoinstitutionalism, "culture matters"), psychological and communicative (R. Taler) factors of economic relations. At the same time, the value nature of market relations is important both in concepts like "global value chains" (M. Porter, G. Jencify) and in the practices of tmnsfonnative investment (Impact Investing), including on the blockchain platform.

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to the issue of identifying the general and specific features of arrangement of local self-government in big cities. This issue is relevant both for the theoretical understanding of the activities of local authorities in city districts, and for improving the system of local self-government in megalopolises.
   Materials and Methods. The study used publicly accessible information and scientific literature on countries and cities with the most pronounced models and approaches to the arrangement of local self-government. The authors adopted the comparative method of research and analyzed the regulatory framework of the selected countries and cities in terms of the arrangement of local self-government as well as the administrative and territorial division.
   Results. A number of foreign models of municipal self-government in large cities have been considered. The analysis of the selected cases (including those of major cities in Europe, America and Asia) has demonstrated the similarity of certain tendencies inherent in both Russian and foreign megalopolises. A trend has been revealed towards the centralization of powers at the city level of administration as a result of the delegation or alienation of resources from the district municipalities.
   Discussion and Conclusion. The foreign experience of arrangement of local self-government in the territories within cities demonstrates that the determining factor for the models of municipal self-government in megalopolises is the balance between the representation of intracity municipalities at the city level and their autonomy, and not the influence of the legal system or political regime. The results of the research can be used when studying the political subjectivity of city districts. Further research will help develop a conceptual framework for the political analysis of the district-level municipalities.

AB The Russian Empire sought to finally solve the problem of integrating the Caucasus into the national political and legal space. The socio-political crisis of the Caucasian region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was provoked by declining efficiency of regional management. The centralization of administrative practices slowed integration of the Caucasus into the Empire, replacing living activity with a dead form. The restoration of the Caucasian vicegerency in 1905 was an extreme step. The institution of the governorship, with its autonomy and independence, was nothing short of fleeing the Empire for the sake of empire. The transformations carried out in extreme conditions returned the trust of the population and the status of mentor to the Russian authorities. However, many problems of modernizing the region were not fully resolved, which contributed to an increase of the potential for conflict and centrifugal tendencies. One of the most acute problems of judicial and administrative organization was the activity of mountain courts. The Senate revision of the Tiflis Court of Justice of 1910 revealed a gap between the highland courts and the all-Russian institutes of legal proceedings, working on the basis of judicial charters on November 20, 1864. Opinions on the harmfulness of the mountain courts and their delineation of highlanders from other imperial subjects was divided among members of the audit, and the ranks of the local administration. Using archival documents, the article illustrates the problem of reorganizing legal proceedings in the southern outskirts of the Russian state.

   theory; Henri Lefebvre; politics of space; global warming; morality;
   theory of action; grounding
AB Timothy Morton's dark ecology is positioned as an aesthetic and ethical study which is far removed from political theory. Although Morton touches upon actual political crises connected with global warming and on climate change skepticism and also deploys such fundamental concepts of political philosophy as territory, space, action and solidarity, he describes his approach as ontological rather than political. The author finds that dark ecology's own foundations have been inherited from political theory. However, that does not make it inconsistent; on the contrary, under the right conditions it enables a different apprehension of both ecology and political philosophy.
   The author asks how politics would proceed in a world of uncertainty and proposes viewing Morton's theory as a treatise on a political theory that addresses the problem of collective action. This is the main concept of any political philosophy out of which its description of the social order is constructed. Dark ecology denies any possibility of action by emphasizing uncertainty and the impossibility of predicting an action's consequences, and this opens up new possibilities for conceptualizing action. It is precisely uncertainty that permits segregating action from the guilt that motivated Morton to divorce dark ecology from political philosophy. This is a narrative about the transformation of Morton the emancipator into a law-giver, about how political theory has evolved in parallel with the onset of the Anthropocene, about what will happen to the Leviathan in the age of global warming, and how to change the perception of the political from ontological categories to ethical ones.

AB Introduction. The article analyzes the contents of the monograph "Warriors and Peasants: The Don Cossacks in Late Imperial Russia" of modern English historian Shane O'Rourke, who is the prominent representative of western English-language historiography. Discussion. The authors note that researches of western (English-language) historiography are the most productive in studying the history of the pre-revolutionary era Cossacks abroad. Analysis. Shane O'Rurk reveals not only political and military plots from Cossacks' history, but also everyday life of the Don Cossack Host in his book. The author focuses attention on such key elements of Cossack history as the mechanism of consolidation of the Cossack world, Cossack motivation, relations between men and women in Cossack stanitsas, organizing Cossack landed property etc. The conclusions Shane O'Rurk made studying the Don Cossacks during its transformation of the late 19th - early 20th centuries are important for the historiography of the Cossacks. In this period he emphasizes on the idea of inevitable, but, perhaps, nevertheless not final disintegration of Cossacks as estates. Shane O'Rurk recognizes country essence of the Cossacks and therefore it seems to him that there is good reason for the parallel between "accident of the peasantry" and inevitable accident of the Cossacks. Shane O'Rurk, developing the myth about special relationships of the imperial power with the Cossacks, focuses attention on the fact that traditionalism became an ideological and practical base of existence of the Don Cossack Host. Shane O'Rurk comes to the conclusion that Don Cossacks nevertheless had chances to avoid final disintegration as the class component of Cossack "nature" had a unique phenomenon of ethno-social identity which was improving in cultural interaction with other people. Results. The authors of the article come to the conclusion that the main value of Shane O'Rurk's work consists in representing the history of the Don Cossacks, which appears not closed on itself, but placed in the general context of Russian history.

ID CHINA
AB The period of detente is usually associated with a decrease of confrontation in US-Soviet relations, the signing of agreements on the limitation of strategic weapons and anti-missile defense systems and the development of trade and economic relations, scientific and cultural exchanges. Strengthening security in Europe is considered another facet of detente. From this perspective detente is viewed as an alternative to the Cold War, and the end of detente is seen as a missed opportunity to develop international relations in the direction of a secure world with working mechanisms for harmonizing the interests of both the great powers and other countries.
   The article deals with the history of relations in the triangle USA - USSR - China in 1977-1980. The evolution of Washington's foreign policy strategy and the inclusion to it policies towards the USSR and China in these years came at the background of pronounced Soviet-Chinese antagonism. In the first months there was no clear plan in the actions of the Carter administration, there was a sharp rivalry for influence on the president between individual political figures (first of all - S. Vance and Zb. Brzezinski). They proposed different scenarios of the development of the US - Soviet and US-China relations. Throughout the Carter presidency, the US used as much as possible the tensions between Moscow and Beijing. In the framework of tripartite relations, each of the sides consistently pursued its own course aimed at achieving unilateral benefits. There were no attempts to establish a trilateral dialogue with an agreed agenda. The processes of detente practically did not affect the complex of international problems that existed within the American - Soviet - Chinese triangle. Moreover, Washington's use of the "Chinese card" prevented the reduction of tensions in American-Soviet relations and strengthened the Cold War logic and methods in the planning and implementation of US foreign policy.

AB Introduction. Decossackization is a complex issue of modern historiography of the Cossacks. The scientific relevance of the decossackization issue is caused by shortage of generalizing studies. The social and political relevance is connected with the Cossack Renaissance in modern Russia. It is possible to see a major boundary in decossackization, which divided traditional and modern history of the Cossacks. Methods. The author uses the method of analytical historiography, complex, structural and comparative analysis of historiographic sources, quantitative analysis of the nomenclature of studies. The bibliography statistics is received on the Russian Science Citation Index (RSCI) database. Analysis. Defining Decossackization: definitions, approaches, periodization. Soviet and post-Soviet historiography. The newest historiography of the 21st century. Alternative and expanded renderings of Decossackization. Approaches to how Decossackization should be determined in the legal systems of Russia and the USA. Determining Decossackization as the genocide of the Cossacks. Considering V.V. Putin and Patriarch Kirill's expressed opinions on Decossackization; the influence of these opinions on the historiography in question. Emphasizing the topicality of researching Decossackization in the historical memory of the Cossacks. Most works on Decossakization were published already in the 21st century, but they amount to only about 1 % of the whole number of studies devoted to the Cossacks, which means that new studies into the question will be both topical and necessary. Results. The scholastic research into Decossackization stems from Soviet historiography. The post-Soviet period saw a wide range of opinions and suggested approaches to the problem of Decossackization. In the 21st century politicians, church leaders, lawyers, historians and the Cossacks themselves have reached a consensus on that Decossackization must be viewed as a tragedy. New researchers agree with the definition of Decossackization as genocide or a kind of cruel mass repression in the Soviet Russia.

AB The article presents the results of the research study Measurement of the degree of value solidarity and the level of social trust in the Russian society conducted by the ZIRCON Research Group in late 2018 - early 2019. The main goal of the study was to identify value orientations of Russians, determine the unifying potential of diverse values and measure the level of social trust. A special section of the study was devoted to religious values, which made it possible to compare the religious identity of respondents with their value orientations, ideological attitudes and opinions on the current issues of the socio-political agenda.
   The empirical data obtained in the course of the study indicate that the declared religiosity of Russians is often superficial (nominal), unstable, and is not supported either by appropriate religious practice or ethical views and value orientations. Its influence on the ideological and political choices of citizens is minimal, and religious institutions do not seem to possess a serious potential for mass political mobilization.
   According to the authors, the public consciousness of Russians is highly fragmented. If earlier it was possible to spot large groups of people with a holistic, logically consistent, internally connected worldview that can be regarded as a common set of ideological views (for example, Russian - Orthodox - loyal to the Russian Orthodox Church - against abortions, etc.), nowadays such integrity is absent. Ideological chains no longer unite people into large communities. The society is divided into quite narrow and at the same time very different in terms of their internal parameters groups. Any combination of three or four dimensions (issues, value ideological constructs) of public discourse divides the Russian society into small fragments.

AB The article presents the results of a quantitative study of authoritarianism in the political culture of modern Russians through its feature such as orientation to the "strong hand". Based on the data of the Levada-Center mass surveys conducted on a representative all-Russian sample, the author compares various indicators of a "strong hand" orientation, examines their dynamics over the past three decades, and using regression analysis reveals the influence of socio-demographic factors on this orientation, determining the "social base" of authoritarianism in the post-Soviet Russia.
   The author's research confirms the high demand for a "strong hand" (authoritarianism) in the modern Russia. At the same time, it shows that as soon as the Russians are offered an alternative model of governance in the form of a system of separation of powers, especially one that is net of Russian specificity, the popularity of the "strong hand" noticeably decreases.
   According to the author, there are different reasons why modern Russians crave for a "strong hand". They include cultural inertia, the traditional sacredness of the image of a strong leader, a pragmatic, purposeful strategy to adapt to the existing political order, and the conscious exploitation of the corresponding mythologeme by the political regime - a kind of imitationary traditionalism of the state, for which the "strong hand" is an important symbolic resource. The institutional characteristics of the current regime in the country (state monopolization of many areas of public life, weak separation of powers, underdeveloped institutions and practices of civil control, etc.) also play an important role. In their turn, authoritarian orientations indirectly support its existence. Authoritarianism in the political culture of modern Russians is in harmony with the institutional structure of the authoritarian regime.

AB The problem of the philosophical foundations of the theory of mind in the context of the relation of philosophical and scientific knowledge is considered. The question on the practical meaning of metaphysics is discussed in a brief review of the development of positivist views. The specifics of Auguste Comte's orthodox doctrine in the first positivism, the verificationist epistemology in logical positivism and Karl Popper's falsificationism in postpositivism are demonstrated. An analysis of the positivist project shows that it does not propose a clear solution to the problem of demarcation of scientific and non-scientific knowledge. The main difficulty in this regard is the reflective nature of positivist propositions the influence of which does not extend to their own content. However, positivists were able to demonstrate several important things. The first positivism taught that scientific and metaphysical knowledge belongs to different levels of abstraction and, therefore, should be used to solve different problems. At the stage of logical positivism, it became clear that only such questions are suitable for scientific discourse that can be answered unequivocally. Postpositivism in the person of Karl Popper established the principle that scientific knowledge which claims to be objective cannot at the same time claim to be universal. On the basis of the arguments presented, a general rule of demarcation of scientific and speculative knowledge is formulated. This rule applies to the anti-physicalist doctrine in the philosophy of mind, which allows identifying the speculative context in modern discussions about the ontological status of conscious experience. An illustration of this is Thomas Nagel's anti-physicalist position and David Chalmers's critical argument against physicalism. Daniel Dennett's opinion that speculative concepts obstruct the science of mind is reinforced by the obtained results. The conclusion is made about the non-scientificity of the anti-physicalist approach to the question of a unified theory of mind.

DE postmodernism; artistic image; simulacrum; space of object
AB Jean Baudrillard's aesthetics is analyzed with reference to the perception of postmodernism culture. The author examines the main aesthetic categories Baudrillard used, such as simulacrum, artistic image, space of object. Aesthetic principles are determined in order to show Baudrillard as a bright representative of postmodernism, who enriched a categorial instruments of postmodernism asthetics. The conception of the artistic image in Baudrillard's aesthetics is considered; it changes in accordance with the contexts of Baudrillard's criticism: from a positive idea, when the artistic image is able to "model" reality for the sake of its "transformation", to a negative one ("wicked nature of image"), when the artistic image provokes the emergence of superreality that makes the artist "conceptually rape the image". The function of the notion of object is revealed as a degree of its aestheticism in Baudrillard's conception. In particular, some principal functions of object are characterized, which make it socially aesthetic: the object's space and color. It is shown that, in Baudrillard's conception, the ideas of artistic image, the space and color of object are unstable and mobile categories that change depending on the context, which means they can be used for an indirect admiration of simulacrum and modern art in general. Being a postmodernism critic, Baudrillard uses the potential of philosophical methods only in postmodernism. Criticism with reference to postmodernism is impossible because it leads to a postmodernism situation. The author illustrates it with an example of Baudrillard's aesthetics: for the philosopher, criticism appears due to the genuine admiration of a criticized phenomenon.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE America; China; space strategy; military space politics
AB The article draws upon the assumption that the U.S.-China struggle for global leadership is inevitable. At present, we witness the surge of interest towards the "active phase" of trade wars flaring since President Trump's taking office. But what is requiring to shed light on is whether the bilateral antagonism may switch to the outer space with 95% of space technologies possessed by the states being dual. Proceeding from this logic, the author examines the extent of reciprocal preparedness towards turning space into a theater of war. The author claims that the space factor has been taken into account by the U.S. military strategists since the last decade of the 20th century, though the more vivid impetus was given by the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization report published in 2001 which revealed insufficient readiness of military and intelligence services to use space for heading off perspective threats. As a result, stepping from pledges to reject any limitations on the fundamental right of a country to operate in and acquire data from space including defense and intelligence-related activities, the United States then came to proclamation of more precise guidelines on how to protect national interests depriving the adversary of potential advantages in space. In due course the issues of "interoperability" of national security systems and their "resilience" came to the fore contributing to better understanding of an impact the cross-domain solutions may have for preventing, countering and sustaining aggression. All in all, space domain mission assurance has become an inalienable part of the U.S. space policy since 2012 already. Amidst the Third Offset Strategy of the United States and Donald Trump's aspirations for strengthening the American deterrence and warfighting options in space, it is expected that soon we will witness correspondent organizational and planning changes making outer space an area of military operational maneuver. Unlike the U.S., China does not have a space doctrine to contain prescriptions on the military use of space. White papers on space activities are majorly intended to build up the frames of providing national security in a peaceful manner. Meanwhile, the Academy of Military Science of the Chinese People's Liberation Army publishes the guiding thoughts defining the Chinese vision of the future military affairs. It states the combination of soft- and hard-kill techniques to coerce the adversary and achieve space superiority, promotes joint operations implying integration of space operations into the military planning system to enable defensive and offensive activities, whether it be space deterrence or space blockade. In the whole, space is characterized as a "commanding height" applicable in asymmetric warfare and seizing the initiative. At the same time, establishment of Strategic Support Forces responsible inter alia for .space activities confirms China's intention to grant this domain a more active role in providing national security. The author comes to a conclusion that having open and concealed hints at each other in strategic documents, and possessing certain similarities in the vision of the future space activities, both the U.S. and China are strategically prepared to shifting disputes to the space arena.

AB The paper examines the process of reorganization of the literary life at the turn of the 20th century related to the spring of modernism. Political division into liberals and conservatives gives way to the unity on an aesthetic basis. Russian symbolism was the first modernist movement that appeared in the 1890s as three independent groups initially not interrelated and even hostile to each other. The mainstream literature met the symbolism with open hostility which made the early symbolists move towards each other and form a community in the beginning of the 1900s, primarily on the pages of the almanac "The Northern Flowers", and then in the first symbolist journal "The New Way". It came to be the journal of a new type, focusing on the Western "revues". The editors of the journal gave priority to personal originality over political views allowing to welcome a wide circle of the new art followers. The close union between symbolism and the contemporary art - painting, crafts, music and theatre - made symbolism the main branch of modernism thanks to which the first decades of the 20th century is commonly referred to as the Silver age of Russian culture.

DE relevance problem; global workspace; massive modularity; multi-track
   disposition; representation; language of thought
AB What is it that gives concepts and propositional attitudes their content? There are two alternative strategies that have been developed for giving an answer to this question. One strategy, defended by Jerry Fodor among others, assumes that propositional attitudes are realized by the storage (in the "belief box", using the popular metaphor) of sentences of a language of thought. This view maintains that concepts are mental states which have both representational and causal properties. The author of the article defends a different strategy, which is based on the cognitive conception of language and which accounts for the content of beliefs in terms of the content of the sentences of the public language to which the agent is disposed to assent. The Fodorian strategy needs a distinction between explicit or "core" beliefs and implicit beliefs because it would not be plausible to say that everything believed is explicitly stored. Fodor uses this problem, which was labeled the Frame Problem, to bolster the view that processes that are involved in fixing belief are holistic. A former proponent of computationalism, Fodor later gives it up largely because of the alleged phenomenon that he himself has given the label isotropy. Analogical reasoning is an example of isotropy: it is a process which depends upon the transfer of information among cognitive domains previously assumed to be irrelevant. The author of the article holds that the problem can be solved if to assume that representations or concepts are abilities that are peculiar to cognitive agents rather than mental particulars. He suggests that one's concepts are multi-track dispositions a la Ryle. We can use ordinary language as a guide for distinguishing dispositions from occurrent states. The obvious way to avoid the problem is by appealing to the attention-focusing power of what Marvin Minsky called frames: descriptions of typical situations like going to a birthday party. These data structures list and organize those facts that would normally be relevant. Some variant of the "sleeping dog" solution is adopted: only those parts of the frame that represent facets of the world that have changed are updated, and the rest is simply left as it is. So one can account for one's apparent ability to make decisions on the basis only of what reflects a change in the ongoing situation without having explicitly to consider every part of the frame system.

DE Enlightenment; Counter-Enlightenment; nature of reality; reason;
   universal language; transformation of society
AB The aim of the article is to explicate the body of arguments of Counter-Enlightenment thinkers. The body of arguments is understood as a set of philosophical ideas, and not just as a social opposition to the French Revolution outcomes on the part of conservative groups. The article is based on predominantly primary sources. These are texts of the classical Enlightenment thinkers (Immanuel Kant, Nicolas de Condorcet, and others) as well as texts of their opponents (Giambattista Vico, Johann Georg Hamann, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, Johann Gottfried Herber, and others). In addition to the primary sources, the article is based on historical and philosophical commentaries on the problem mentioned above, in particular, on Isaiah Berlin's Counter-Enlightenment. The research method is hermeneutic. The study is based on the identification of the essential core of the educators' position and, accordingly, the symmetrical pool of their opponents' counterarguments. Four ideas are fixed as the core: the statement of a single reasonable principle of the world order, the understanding of thinking by the model of natural sciences, the fixation of the results of thought in a universal language and the possibility of building an ideal society on the basis of this knowledge. The pool of counterarguments also comprises four ideas: the impossibility of a rational understanding of the world, the value of abilities other than the calculating mind for understanding the world, the statement of the impossibility of a universal language and, finally, the fixation of essential problems of revolution and reform in the quest for an ideal society. A significant result of the study is a debate with Berlin on a number of statements. First of all, the author of the article points out the incorrectness of the separation of the ideas of the Enlightenment and the Counter-Enlightenment on the "geographical" basis, as ideas, respectively, formed in France and Germany. Further, a more complex nature of the debate on each point of divergence than that presented in Berlin's work is shown. In particular, it is shown that the Vico-Herder line leads to the genesis of the humanities, and the Leibniz-Goethe-Schelling line leads to the genesis of the biological sciences; both lines, in fact, cannot be attributed as anti-Enlightenment by essence. The debate around the key cognitive abilities of man does not revolve around simple dilemmas of "mind and feeling", "mind and intuition", "mind and faith" and so on. Rather, in most concepts, one finds a complex relationship between thinking and intuition in cognition. The debate against a universal language also has its limits, which can be seen in the example of distinguishing the general and special meaning of a word in Friedrich Schleiermacher's hermeneutics or in the example of educational activities of Wilhelm von Humboldt, who, in fact, clearly thematized language as an expression of the individual. And, finally, at the level of ideas, the debate between the progressives and the anti-progressives also does not look unambiguous. In the article, this fact is demonstrated through the tension between the statement of the infinite diversity of cultures and the normative development of humanity to Human tat by Herder.

DE chronotope; space; time; consciousness; empiricism
AB Classical English empiricism of the 17th century is one of the most detailed and justified epistemological theories in the European philosophic traditions. Such empiricists as Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes and John Locke proceeded from the priority of empirical cognition developed on the basis of inductive-analytical methodology. In contrast to them, French and German rationalists (Rene Descartes, Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz) considered deductive and postulatory methods to be of primary importance. In the theory of empiricism, experience was divided into external (which involved the perception of the world around) and internal one consisting in consciousness reflection in the frames of which a cognoscitive subject appeals to the inner world of his intellect discovering and describing its content and structure. The key achievement of empirical epistemology was the detection of the a priori transcendental framework of the human cognitive ability in the process of its reflection (according to Immanuel Kant's famous term "physiology of the intellect"). This framework was formed by the spatiotemporal correlation the elements of which appeared both in the forms of perception making possible experience itself and, first of all, as the logical-schematic forms of thinking. The novelty and theoretical significance of this research consist in the fact that the structure of consciousness disclosed in the works of famous philosophers-empiricists is interpreted by the category of chronotope reflecting the spatiotemporal interrelations of Being. The foundation of this approach is the unity of the spatial and temporal dimensions of thinking demonstrated in classical empiricism and immanent for the mechanism of its synthesis. Moreover, dialectical interaction of consciousness with the phenomenal reality of the outside world proves to be the justification of this approach as well. In the final synthesis of epistemology statements and the chronotope theory, consciousness functions as an autonomous semantic spatiotemporal sphere in which acts of thinking and perception are considered to be the expression of its activity. The a priori chronotopological structure of intellect shown by the philosophy of empiricism demonstrates a strong correlation with the existential ontological basis of human being as far as the existence of thinking turns out to be connected with the existence of Being.

AB An important factor of combat effectiveness of any army is its morale, which is largely based on its loyalty to the relevant state (government) and social order. The article raises the problem of an objective study of the loyalty of the armed forces during wartime. The main object of analysis is the Russian Imperial Army during the Russo-Japanese and the First World Wars. The author proposes to explore the loyalty of the armed forces using the appropriate indicator. Its values are calculated on the basis of empirical data on various types of combat casualties (killed, wounded and taken prisoner). The differences in loyalty of different types of troops (infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering and Cossack troops, as well as border guards), on the one hand, are analyzed, and the loyalty of officers and soldiers of lower ranks in the army of the Russian Empire, on the other. In terms of loyalty to the state during the Russo-Japanese and the First World Wars, officers of the Russian Imperial Army, as a rule, outstripped the lower ranks. The greater level of loyalty of officers during the Russo-Japanese War, in particular, is indicated by differences in the nature of injuries received by officers and lower ranks on the battlefield, as well as by differences in the causes of their injuries. In the course of the Russo-Japanese War, officers of the border guard, engineering troops and cavalry, as well as lower ranks of cavalry, demonstrated the most loyalty, and the officers of artillery and the lower ranks of the engineering troops and artillery the least. During the First World War, officers of Cossack troops, border guards and cavalry showed the greatest loyalty; and the loyalty level of officers of artillery, engineering troops and infantry was noticeably behind. Differences in loyalty of different contingent categories were due to the social origin of the officers and the lower ranks, as well as the type of military activity characteristic of different types of troops. There were noticeable differences in the degrees of loyalty of the troops of the Russian Empire and Japan, as well as of the armed forces of the main countries participating in the First World War. These differences were among the factors that determined the outcomes of the Russo-Japanese and the First World Wars.

TI A PHENOMENOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION ON STRUCTURES OF TRANSCENDENTAL

DE transcendental subjectivity; egological structure; subjective
   spatiality; genetic constitution
AB The starting point of a phenomenological investigation is reflection. The formation of this approach is based on the discoveries of Rene Descartes, John Locke and Immanuel Kant. The concept of reflection is most fully represented in Edmund Husserl's works devoted to phenomenological reduction. The consistent implementation of the reduction leads to a structural analysis of the phenomenon of transcendental subjectivity in order to substantiate the unity of scientific knowledge. The doctrine of transcendental subjectivity is associated with the idea of "dividing the self' (Ichspaltung). The exact formulation of this idea becomes possible as a result of a rethinking of the transcendental nature of philosophy while maintaining the distinction between the actual and the transcendental egos. In connection with this, the very approach to the analysis of subjective structures also changes: attention shifts to the theory of constitution. Phenomenology is based on the fundamental possibility of a pure ego which is actualized through reflection. The reflective separation of the pure ego into two parts is represented by using the familiar spatial model with its top and bottom. The model is grounded by subjective spatiality. Due to the phenomenon of "dividing the self', it becomes possible to study the diverse egological structures. This article discusses the following principal theses. (1) Ego-structure is a system of potentiality. Such a system is not an abstract possibility, but a positive predisposition. (2) The pure ego is central to other elements of any integral egological structure. (3) The pure ego as a primary form of objects has its own substance which consists of noematic unities (categories). (4) Any object of external space corresponds to the internal structure of subjective spatiality. The solution of such issues cannot be limited to the structural analysis of transcendental subjectivity; methods of genetic constitution are also required. Genetic constitution enables criticism of one's judgments and allows considering subjectivity in its concrete implementation. The genetic nature of transcendental phenomenology leads to intersubjectivity issues.

AB The article explores the foundations of conservative trends in Russian politics. The manifestation of conservative tendencies is seen in the very nature of the neo-patrimonial political regime prevailing in post-Soviet Russia, and in the legitimizing ideology on which it is based. The formation of the neopatrimonial regime and its ideological foundations are considered as a manifestation of the archaization of Russian society, which also manifests itself in the strengthening of the role of religion in Russian society; while religiosity itself has a certain specificity, which makes it possible to talk about the presence of archaizing tendencies within the framework of religious consciousness.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the organization and conduct of mass movements in modern Russia. A review of a number of mass movements in Russia was made: the March to Moscow of the trade union of workers of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the rally of medical workers in Moscow, the protest movement of truckers against the Platon toll system. The movement in support of Alexei Navalny in 2017 was analyzed to give a detailed description of the specificity of the functioning of mass movements in modern Russia. The choice of this movement was due to its mass character, publicity of activity, wide media coverage, political significance, the use of various tools for mobilizing the masses. The study was based on three main methods: case study, event analysis, network analysis. The authors described the goals and resources of this movement's organization, the chronology, conducted a quantitative analysis of the mass events, determined the status of the events. In order to analyze the scale of Navalny's activities on organizing mass actions, the authors analyzed offline collective actions in 2017 in the Central Federal District of Russia (based on 265 information sources). The online activity was analyzed on the example of social network pages of the Anti-Corruption Foundation for the period from September 2017 to February 2018. The purpose of the analysis was to determine the links between the created pages of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (Vkontakte, Facebook, Twitter) and to identify the most frequently used forms of activity (likes, reposts, comments). The analysis made it possible to reveal that the greatest relationship is with posts posted on social networks Vkontakte and Facebook (98%). The study revealed a pattern: posts that receive the greatest response from users have the largest number of likes, reposts and comments. Thus, the reaction of users is expressed immediately in all possible forms. Users pay more attention to posts with a significant number of likes, reposts and comments. More likes contribute to the growth of reposts and comments to the post. Navalny achieved his popularity largely due to a competent Internet campaign, which included investigations, protection of citizens' rights, massive use of social networks to mobilize his supporters, direct communication with them and organization of performances. Internet platforms created by Navalny are a key mechanism for mobilizing the masses of the population. The large array of information disseminated through Internet platforms contributes to the formation of common interests and the unification of participants to collective action. Thus, it can be stated that Navalny has formed an effective symbiosis of collective action tools based on both online and offline elements.

TI WHAT ELSE IS WRONG WITH THE "PRIVATE LANGUAGE ARGUMENT"?

DT Article
DE private language; private language argument; Wittgenstein; Kripke;
   meaning
AB The article is devoted to the private language problem formulated by Ludwig Wittgenstein in his book Philosophical Investigations. The problem is considered through the prism of analysis of Saul Kripke's interpretation of the private language argument presented in his Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language. The purpose of the analysis is to clarify the meaning of the notion of "understanding the language". For this purpose, the author of the article distinguishes two types of the theory of meaning. Such a distinction allows achieving the three main objectives of the research. (1) This distinction reveals the fundamental duality of the notion "understanding". Thus, in terms of the theory of meaning of the first type, "understanding" is identified with interpretation (in the sense of establishing correspondence between non-linguistic entities and linguistic units). While, in terms of the theory of meaning of the second type, "understanding" is identified with understanding of the rule (in the sense of being master of a technique of following the rules of correct usage). (2) This distinction also clarifies how Wittgenstein and his interpreters treat the duality of the notion "understanding". It is shown that this duality is of great methodological significance for Wittgenstein, who uses it as an important tool for distinguishing between two interdependent aspects of language understanding. In turn, Kripke neglects the methodological significance of this duality and uses the notion "understanding" in one single meaning as understanding of the rule. (3) Finally, this distinction allows explicating the conceptual inconsistency between the description of the private language (given in 243 of Philosophical Investigations) and Kripke's interpretation of the private language argument. The second part of the article is devoted to the justification of the assumption that the above-mentioned conceptual inconsistency is critical to Kripke's argument. The article concludes that the explication of the conceptual inconsistency between the description of the private language and Kripke's interpretation of the private language argument not only clarifies the discussion of the private language problem, but also opens the way for the possibility of a private language.

AB The issue of the effectiveness of the state's reputation capital in Russian political system is being studied in the context of its matter, structure, organization factors, trends, approaches and patterns.
   The subject of the study is the trust in the main political institutions as a resource of reputation capital of the state.
   The following Russian and foreign scientists devoted their works to the study of the reputation capital and its trust: Anokhin, Byba, Grankin, Rozanova, Rudakova, Timofeeva, Baudrillard, Bourdieu, Toffler, and Fukuyama.
   The purpose of the study is to analyze Russian reputation capital in the context of turbulence, increasing global instability, new challenges, risks and threats. The researchers tend to solve the following tasks: to determine the essence of the state's reputation capital; to reveal the level of the state's reputation through the level of trust in its political institutions; to identify trends of its strengthening and weakening in the context of trust.
   The authors applied the following studying approaches and methods: systemic, institutional, neoinstitutional and comparative approaches; comparative analysis, structural and functional analysis, sociological analysis, observation, overt observation and extrapolation.
   In the article, the essence of the state's reputation capital is considered. The components of its structure are studied. Aspects of disappointment with the functioning of some classical political institutions are highlighted. The establishment and development of new growth points in Russia is impossible without the increasing of the trust in the state and its political institutions, without building up its reputation capital, ensuring civil peace and harmony.

DE Neo-Kantianism; culture; society; norm; sobornost
AB This article analyzes the specificity of the formation of social phenomena in Fyodor Stepun's philosophy of culture. The philosopher of the Russian Abroad developed an interpretation of culture as a sociocultural process, in which each person contributes to the development of culture. This concept of society was achieved in the axiology of the Southwest School of Neo-Kantianism by Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert. The axiological method allows one to understand reality as the opposition of an a priori value and a historical fact. Culture is an improvement of the realization of values, in the process of which all social communications are forming. Religion plays the role of a tool for the interaction of eternal values and historical development. Every person, by addressing transcendent reality, justifies freedom in his or her own life. The concept of norms in Windelband's philosophy is an expression of the super-experienced connection of a multitude of people, which allows one to focus on the meaning of eternal values. And religion allows each person to actualize the norm as a personal motive. Following Windelband, Stepun defines the functionality of religion in the constitution of society as a tool to justify the significance of a moral trajectory in the defining of the functionality of social phenomena. The concept of sobornost ("togetherness", "symphony") is most consistent with the task of substantiating the regulations of the life of an individual person, understood as part of a sociocultural phenomenon per se. People correlate their own lives with cultural development through sobornost, a tool for constant optimization of aspirations and interests, updating the assessment of their own lives and the lives of others. The justification of social phenomena as a result of the correlation of the ideas of European philosophy and Russian religious and philosophical thought made by Stepun is based on the controversy, which was formed in the intellectual environment of the Russian Abroad and which is expressed in the opposition of Western methodological individualism and the idea of sobornost from the Russian philosophical tradition. Stepun's solution hows the fundamental feasibility of the correlation of ideas proposed in European socio-philosophical constructions with conceptions of Russian religious philosophy.

DE Alexander Bogdanov; literary utopia; collectivist culture; collective

AB The article focuses on Alexander Bogdanov's utopian novel The Red Star (1908), which is interpreted as a sort of literary experimentation that, in a free artistic form, develops ideas of socialist revolution, collectivist culture, and the future of civilization. The author analyzes the ways in which the novel poses the question of the future communist culture that requires a new subject of perception. It is demonstrated that, in the novel, this new, different subject of perception is introduced via the experience of the movie audience, while Bogdanov's description of the protagonist's behavior could well be interpreted as a film script of a special kind. It is via the personal experience of a movie spectator that something which might be called the experiencing of collective sensuousness (or sensuousness of the community) opens to the protagonist of the novel. This form of sensuousness is shared by all, regardless of social, political, or class distinctions and interests.

AB The article analyzes Alexander Bogdanov's systemic approach to historical process. Society is portrayed in development-like a living creature that evolves in response to the challenges of its environment. The adaptation of community-and of man as part of it-is expressed as a sum of relations: social, economic, cultural, and political. The author demonstrates that industrial relations and labor are the factors which define man's level of development and produce new forms of social consciousness and culture. The article concludes that harmonious, well-balanced development of the system called "society" depends on conscious efforts of its members sharing a community of vision, goal, and labor.

AB The article discusses the conditions under which the views of the philosopher, economist, physician, and science fiction author Alexander Alexandrovich Bogdanov (1873-1928) was formed and analyzes the evolution of his ideas and his social activity in the sphere of political, practical, and cultural changes of Russian society. The focus of the present study is on the last years of the nineteenth and the opening years of the twentieth century-the period when Bogdanov was most active as a revolutionary, marking at the same time the beginning of the heyday of his creative work in science and philosophy, including the so-called Tula and Vologda phases of his banishment. During the latter, his political activity was at its peak, and it was then that his views-including the concepts of "proletarian education" (or "enlightenment") and "socialism in the present"-had essentially taken their final shape that was preserved and maintained through the subsequent decade.

AB Introduction. Nowadays, the modern higher education involves not only advanced theoretical training, but also the formation of practical skills and universal professional skills, which contribute to the development of skills of future specialists and their successful careers. The participation of students in the research work is considered as a special direction of improvement of professional competency and an essential factor of general cultural development of the student's personality. The research work creates prerequisites for qualitative change of the whole working practice through the acquisition of abilities to act reasonably in working situations, to solve tasks and problems independently and effectively, to assess the results of own work adequately. However, the active inclusion of students in research activities was characterised by the lack of guidelines, which could be used to fill the gaps in research methodology and research procedures. This fully applies to the students of political science specialties and updates the interpretation of research and political science practices.
   The aim of the article is to reveal the peculiarities of organisational and technological procedures of complex socio-political applied research, using a specific example of a training model.
   Methodology and research methods. The authors used general scientific and special methods and approaches: formalisation, abstraction, comparative analysis, system-based and conceptual approaches, etc. An interview was conducted as the main applied method to diagnose the degree of students' (bachelor's and master's degree students training in the discipline "Political Science" at Ogarev Mordovia State University) interest in research work and their understanding of the importance of practice-oriented learning.
   Results and scientific novelty. On the basis of the students(sic) questionnaire responses, the factors characterising the problem situation "Quality of Student Research Work", are worked out in detail. The survey questionnaire revealed that the research work is perceived by students as a qualification component for obtaining master's / bachelor's degrees, but not as an important element of professional development. A good level of theoretical knowledge of the subject area is frequently negated by the low development of practical skills, including due to the unwillingness or lack of opportunity to participate in practice-oriented research. However, the majority of respondents (77.7%) stated that they lack available information sources on the methodology of specific scientific papers with examples in order to indeppendently choose the research strategy and to develop their own professional skills. In this regard, on the example of the topic "Spatial Development of Russia as a Factor of Nation-Building and Formation of National Idea", a universal programme of political applied research was developed. The programme can be used as a basis for long-term analysis and as a template for other thematic studies. The proposed scheme includes the selection of analysis methods and techniques to maximise the scope of the study area.
   Practical significance. The described research methodology can be used in educational practice, when teaching the following disciplines: "Methods and Technologies of Political Science", "Information and Analytical Work", "Political Analysis and Forecasting", etc.

AB In the second part of the article dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the dissolution of the German Democratic Republic, the author continues to analyze the factors leading to the collapse of the state, which was the basis of the post-war security system created by the USSR. The retrospective analysis of the events in the autumn of 1989 showed that at that time the republic was facing all pre-conditions typical for the internal crisis. The author describes the growth of the opposition, the creation of its organizational structure and emergence of its leaders who put forward attractive slogans and initiated actions provoking the crisis, the availability of a strong political, ideological and material support, provided by the external actors, the weak performance of the legitimate authorities. The author argues that the decision of the USSR leadership to step away from the German issue speeded up the collapse of the socialist state in East Germany. The GDR dissolution led to similar events in a number of East Europe states and became the prologue of the demise of the postwar bipolar system.

AB The author argues that the latest elections to the European Parliament (EP) became a landmark event in the party-political landscape of the Old World. The elections confirmed the trend emerged in the beginning of the XXI century: nationalist parties almost everywhere strengthened their electoral positions. In Austria, Italy and Finland they gained solid experience of coalition work. In the Netherlands and Belgium nationalist parties managed to enter local government. To a big extent, nationalists influenced the governments in Denmark, Sweden, and, more recently, in Spain. Nationalists became active in Eastern Europe (Poland, Hungary). Their primary political interest is focused on the European Union reforms, the migration issue, the social processes in the EU, relations between Europe and the United States, China, and Russia. After the European elections in May, 2019, they created the large "Identity and Democracy" group within the European parliament. The article examines conflicting trends in the nationalist camp, the development of both centripetal and centrifugal tendencies. It is possible to assess the current situation only by considering objective and subjective factors typical both for individual countries, regions of Europe, and for the continent as a whole.

DT Article
DE Small States theory; Shelter theory; Baltic states; political elite;
   institutional regionalism
AB The article is dedicated to the problem of searching for an explanatory model of the foreign policy choice of the Baltic states' political elites. The purpose of this study is to compare the latest theoretical and methodological developments with current practices of the Baltic political elites on the international level. The small states theory and the shelter theory in the context of institutional regionalism are used as supporting concepts. The roles of "mediator", "gatekeeper" and "missionary" are the most accessible ones. Functional capabilities of small states delegated by world or regional powers correspond to these roles. The Baltic elites are implementing a generally trivial tactic of adaptation to changes in the international political situation, often to the detriment of the strategic tasks of strengthening their own statehood and sovereignty. The case of the Baltic states clearly shows the difference in political, economic and social opportunities and restrictions on the choice and mode of action of the elites of small states in the foreign policy environment. The "historical path" of a purely Western orientation is one of the most significant limitations of the foreign policy choice of the political elites of the Baltic states.

AB The article discusses the role of external challenges (military-political pressure and demonstration effect) in modernization of societies from the perspective of asynchronous global development. According to this research, interstate and inter-regional imbalances and disparities are the "birthmark" of world history. Disparities of development create tensions between and among countries resultant of conflicts between national governments. Comparing the concepts of "challenge-and-response" by A.J. Toynbee and "economic superiority" ("economic primacy") by C. Kindleberger, the author suggests the idea of "avant-garde society", i.e. society programming the basic parameters of modernization of the "catching up" peoples. "Later take-or societies - Germany, Japan and Italy, to name just a few, - mobilized domestic resources like savings ratios, literacy, indigenous technologies, social capital and even ideology to compete on equal footing with pioneers of industrialization. The "later take-off' societies, Germany in particular, proved so efficient to join the league of the most advanced nations. The net economic impact of state intervention was vivid where markets were well-developed. State-centered mode of the "guided capitalism" was instrumental of upgrading Germany to the rank of the leading economic power, second only to the United States of America. Nowadays, with the collapse of the Soviet-American bipolarity and the subsequent disintegration of Pax Americana, the geopolitical structure of the modern world is becoming more composite, whilst the desire to attain the "avant-garde society" status forms a complex polymorphic architecture of a constantly changing oecumen/human space. In the new, tightening world, the external challenge factor is of central importance. Economy and geopolitics, therefore, predetermine a country's ability to move to the position of the "avant-garde society". In this constant motion, within the world political hierarchy, a prominent role belongs to the factors of physical geography, more specifically: to the peculiarities of interaction between the nature and society, which often require the people to act in a "challenge-and-response" pattern.

AB The article discusses Russian-Chinese relations and their impact on the state and development prospects of such an important international region as Eurasia. The authors pay special attention to the evolution of Russian-Chinese relations in historical retrospect, to the peculiarities of forming a strategic partnership between the two leading powers of Eurasia, and to the expansion of their political and economic cooperation. The article notes that the transformation of Eurasia into a significant political force in international relations was associated with qualitative changes in the global economic and political situation, with a new content of models of rivalry and cooperation. The article comprehensively examines the historical stages of the transformation of the Eurasian center of power, the processes of its elevation and fragmentation, and the place in this of Russia and China. Particular attention is paid to the specifics of Eurasian interdependence, the strengthening of innovation factors in the content and forms of the Eurasian transformation. In the analysis of the system of the Eurasian space, the authors focus on highlighting the main trends in the political sphere, strengthening the importance of the organizational forms of relations between the European Union and China, as well as on the features of Russian-Chinese relations in the post-Ukrainian period that influenced the consolidation of the Eurasian economic complex. The article analyzes the nature and nature of the relationship between the emerging Eurasian economy and the national economies of the countries included in the Eurasian space. At the same time, the authors explore the problem of organizing global and regional security spaces and forming the structure of a complex combination of horizontal and vertical ties.

DT Article
DE Iran; world oil market; sanctions; foreign investment; technological
   level; buy back contracts; new type of oil contract; US; European Union;
   China
AB Iran is the fourth world largest holder of proved oil reserves, extraction costs of Iranian oil are comparatively low. Oil production dynamics in the country is sharply cyclical and these cycles are generated by political factors, exogenous to the oil sector. Peak in oil production was achieved in 1974 and for the last forty years Iran's share in the world oil production is declining. The article reveals that among powerful exogenous shocks negatively affecting the dynamics of oil production in Iran there were unilateral and multilateral sanctions. The first sanctions against Iran were introduced by the USA in 1979. Since the middle of the 1990-ies sanctions have become a system. The long-term negative effects of sanctions substantially exceed the short-term ones. Largely due to the sanctions the technological level of Iranian oil sector remains very low. Global energy companies and banks prefer to reject interactions with Iranian counterparties due to the expanding practice of the extraterritorial regime of US sanctions that has transformed Iranian hydrocarbons into a "toxic asset". Asia-Pacific countries, preserving oil import from Iran under the sanctions regime, got an opportunity to set very favorable for them terms of contracts. Iranian oil is bought with a price discount, for partially convertible and/or unconvertible currencies, often in exchange for a counter barter supply of goods. Expectations that non-Western oil companies would substitute for European investments have failed so far. Given the accelerating global race for monetization of hydrocarbon reserves and risk of forthcoming peak in global demand for oil there is a growing probability that a substantial part of commercially competitive Iranian oil reserves will remain in the ground.

There are two polar positions on the question: one approves the necessary connection between explanation and reduction, and the other is against the identification of these concepts. The principles of reductive explanation imply the possibility of translating the language of high-level theories into the language of fundamental theory. From a philosophical point of view, this means that entities postulated by a high-level theory exist only if there are objects described by the fundamental concept. This view on the problem of reduction entails the need to accept the principle of ontological homogeneity and, as a result, the deterministic stance which in essence does not give rise to contradictions in the case of the methodology of empirical natural science. A nonreductive explanation model denies the possibility of an unequivocal translation of high-level theories into general principles and laws. The main problem of the concept of non-reductive explanation is the statement of the existence of entities non-reducible to the fundamental theory, yet knowable. It seems that this position does not stand up for non-contradiction testing and is inconsistent with the epistemological principles of natural science. In the article, John Smart's reductive model is analyzed with the involvement of the type identity theory. The non-reductive explanatory strategy proposed by the philosopher-evolutionist Konrad Lorenz is considered. Lorenz's law of "fulguration" is compared with the concept of non-reductive emergentism and with the "systemic" principle of Gestalt psychology. The incoherence of the non-reductive explanatory model is demonstrated, and the conclusion is made about the necessary connection between reduction and explanation.

DE fate as a universal of culture; mythologems of fate; categories of
   science and philosophy; scientific ontology
AB The article focuses on the rootedness of the conceptual framework of scientific ontologies (as well as philosophical ones) in the ancient pre-reflexive and pre-theoretical life experience of archaic people, whose mythological contemplation shaped their worldview representations and attitudes. Fate is analyzed as a cultural universal which represents a complex of mythological images - necessity, chance, law, reason, time, which turned into fundamental categories as a result of philosophical and scientific reflection. Science is the center of modern civilization, changing the shape and setting the vector of its development. During the study of the factors that had influence on the formation and development of science, researchers more often pay attention to the role of sociocultural ones and rarely turn to the analysis of their origins, rooted in the pre-reflective, pre-theoretical deep layers of culture. An appeal to the mythological and philosophical foundations of science is the search and identification of the "roots", the origins that made (created) science and preserve their meaning in an implicit form at present. In this respect, the analysis of mythological images of the cultural universal "fate" is very interesting. The content of this universal is a set of mythological images - necessity and chance, law, reason, time. These images were the source of theoretical ideas in the first layer of "philosophemes" about the most general philosophical foundations of culture, the further understanding of which allowed to form fundamental categories in philosophy and science. The mythologem "fate" was formed under the influence of gnoseogenic factors, which are connected with the accumulation of experience of observing the natural world and with the cognition of the outer characteristic of the phenomena of nature, and also of sociogenic factors, which refer to the place of the individual in the social structure according to their destiny. With the growth of personal consciousness and the division of primitive society into social groups, there emerged a necessity to regulate and justify one's position in the social structure. Sociogenic factors had an overwhelming influence on the formation of the mythologem "fate" in the Greek tradition. A special emphasis in the interpretation of fate is the idea of everything being predetermined, independent of the efforts of man; the origins of this idea go back to archaic times. In mythological consciousness, there was a semantic system that generated the ideas of necessity, law, reason, time, eternity. These ideas became the subject of philosophical reflection, which resulted in a layer of special categories - logical-ontological categories. This layer of categories in scientific knowledge is a part of the philosophical foundations of science. They are primarily included in their ontological subsystem, represented by a grid of categories that serve as a matrix of understanding and cognition of the researched objects - categories of causality, necessity, law, chance, time, etc. The categorial foundations of science are a special area, which simultaneously belongs to the internal structure of science and to its infrastructure, and through it science is permanently connected with philosophy and culture.

DE transcendentalism; formal pragmatics; Habermas; life world;
   communicative rationality
AB The article discusses an aspect of Habermas's teaching related to the theory of formal pragmatics he developed and his views on the basis of knowledge. The remarkableness of formal pragmatics is due to the fact that this concept, on the one hand, is the embodiment of the so-called post-metaphysical thinking, which is characterized by the rejection of thought "under the sign of eternity" and the recognition of the essential situationality of our thinking, and, on the other hand, it retains the role of the "guardian of rationality" for philosophy and sees its task in finding the grounds that make "claims on rationality", going beyond local sociocultural contexts. The author is interested in the question of whether it is possible to consider Habermas's views on the essence of cognitive activity as a continuation of universalism in the theory of knowledge. Or is it, despite the discussion of the conditions of the general significance of knowledge, the continuation of the substantiation of the position of contextuallism and relativism in the epistemology characteristic of post-metaphysical thought? In response to the questions posed, the author, firstly, considers the theory of the "life world" Habermas proposed and, secondly, the concept of "communicative rationality" he introduced. The author notes that formal pragmatics is not a concept that continues the tradition of universalism in the theory of knowledge, it affirms the principles of contextualism and relativism in epistemology. Habermas proceeds from the fact that our cognitive activity is carried out in the horizon of a specific life world, it always grows out of the local historical context, due to cultural traditions and social habits, which means that our knowledge of the world is not value-neutral. In addition, the so-called "universal significant claims" of the language are not absolute intelligible structures that are "beyond space and time", they are inscribed in history and culture. Claims for significance do not ensure the universality and necessity of the results of cognition in Kant's sense. General significance is associated only with the achievement of involuntary consent within a community. In addition, the universalist potential of communication is realized only within the life world of modern society. For the living world of traditional societies, rational communication in Habermas's sense is not characteristic.

DE access; higher education; disability; field; social capital
AB The article discusses the different types of capital of students with disabilities as agents in the field of higher education and analyzes the role of social capital in the transformation of practices in this field. The analysis is carried out on the basis of qualitative interviews conducted in five universities in Kazan, Novosibirsk, Samara, Saratov, Tomsk with students with motor, hearing, visual disabilities and with university professors with experience in admissions committees. A student with a disability enters a university as a pre-existing, given field. Universities can be conservative, inhibit change and impede students' attempts to engage and participate in decision-making in higher education policies. Barriers to education can arise among students because of the impossibility or their inability to voice their position. The types of capital students with disabilities have are formed by social networks, laid by the school and the family, determined by the level of training and the economic status. Even students from wealthy families have difficulties acquiring cultural capital, since they must overcome their habitus of disability in themselves and in the perception of others. In the process of accumulating social capital, they change the structure of interactions and the nature of social ties, as well as self-esteem, thereby acquiring a qualitatively new cultural capital. Higher education becomes a resource of social and cultural capital not only for students with disabilities, but also for all field agents. Friendship, student interactions, everyday communication of students with professors and staff lead to the habitualization of the characteristics of students with disabilities. The actions of these and other field agents, their individual practices will simultaneously reproduce and to some extent transform the field.

TI Power as an Object of Legal Research: A Problem Aspect
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE law; power; object of legal research; theory of state and law;
   jurisprudence; state studies; legal theory of power; legal cratology
AB The article is devoted to power as an object of legal research. The problem of power in this capacity is seen, first of all, in the fact that it, being actually the object of such research, is not recognized by the official doctrine in this status and there is no separate branch of science about it. At the same time, there is a lack of legal knowledge about power, which negatively affects the methodology of legal research and the quality of the doctrinal reflection of the objective reality. It is proved that power is a fundamental object of legal knowledge similar to the law, which is studied by jurisprudence and recognized as its object. Equivalence of law and power in the indicated sense follows from the fact that each of these factors equally serves as the basis of the reality studied by legal science. It is substantiated that the named reality is formed by the integrity of the functioning of law and power. Such integrity serves as a source of legal order and is considered as a legal continuum of freedom. It is noted that the relationship of law and power are objective. They manifest the universal principle of unity and struggle of opposites and ensure the transition of activity from its state of potentiality to the state of actuality by the integrity of their functioning. Neither the law nor the authorities are able to streamline the connections of the subjects of social interaction alone. Methodologically, the analyzed characteristics of law and power make it necessary to take into account the equivalence of these phenomena in the formation and functioning of legal reality. Such an approach is justified methodologically; it corresponds to the objects of study and their interconnectedness. It is also confirmed by the experience of scientific research. Power, despite the fact that it is not officially recognized as an object of legal research, is actually investigated both in state studies and in jurisprudence. Many candidate and doctoral dissertations, monographs and scientific papers are devoted to power and especially to the political power, its branches, functions, bodies. In science, the formation of a system of legal knowledge of power is underway. Legal cratology is formed at the border of general cratology, jurisprudence and political science as a branch of knowledge about power in its opposition and connection with law. Together with legal cratology, its theoretical foundations are being developed and, first of all, the legal theory of power. The author makes a conclusion about the need for an official recognition of power as an object of legal research equivalent to the law. This will activate the study of power and will contribute to the formation of a doctrinal system of legal knowledge about it.

DE John Dewey; instrumentalism; continuous education; experience; museum
AB John Dewey (1859-1952), an American philosopher, was recognized as one of the outstanding philosophers and educational theorists in the 20th century, but the influence of his ideas remains substantial in the 21st century. Dewey believed that philosophy should be closely connected with life activity or even flow out of it, which he proved by his own example. In his philosophical works, Dewey sought to achieve a balance of ideas and avoided dualism, believing that the latter would lead to the formation of a hierarchy of values. He insisted on the application of democratic, progressive concepts in all spheres of life (political, economic, social, cultural, educational, etc.). The axial concept of his philosophy was "experience". The foundation of the educational philosophy, according to Dewey, was the close relationship between current experience in all its diversity and education. It is also important that one should take into account the quality of experience, expressed in two aspects: immediate agreeableness or disagreeableness and influence on subsequent experience. To determine the pedagogical value of experience, Dewey used the principles of continuity, or the experiential continuum, and interaction. Progressive education refers to problem-based experiences. Dewey viewed museums as an integral part of a rich life-experience that promotes education. He believed that people learned in museums, just like they could learn in schools and from books. Moreover, this learning can last as long as a person's life. The pragmatist ideas about education reflect the problems of lifelong learning (adult learning), updated in the second half of the 20th century, while the idea of lifelong learning is not new, its origins are found in ancient philosophy. Based on Dewey's instrumental practice, constructivists described the practice of learning in museums. Ted Ansbacher analyzed museum learning and its effectiveness. George E. Hein focused on the educational role of museums. David F. Monk revealed features of adult learning in museums. By the end of the 20th century, the museum began to be perceived as an experimental platform for receiving continuous and informal education in modern society.

TI Hybrid Globalization: Ideas and Concepts
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE globalization; hybridity; multiculturalism; cultural diversity; hybrid
   globalization
AB The aim of this article is to present an analysis of the contemporary type of globalization - hybrid globalization. The analysis of hybrid globalization is based on the following methods: comparative studies, globalization studies, issues on hybridization. At the core of the modern globalization process, one could find a set of social, cultural, political processes transforming the world community into global social, economic, political, cultural interconnections, interdependencies, flows. These processes create a mixture of social, cultural, political forms, styles, structures, which have been described and analyzed by theorists of globalization (e.g., M. Seger, L. Maracz, etc.) as instances of hybridization. In order to investigate hybrid globalization, the authors of the article discuss cultural, political and social features of the heterogeneous global world order. The authors start argumentation by discussing the specifics of hybrid globalization in the context of the world cultural diversity. On the basis of the authors' analysis of hybrid globalization, several key problems of the hybrid globalization theory are scientifically grounded. Hard cases of hybrid globalization are discussed in the context of philosophy. Normative issues of multiculturalism, based on the works of J. Rawls, that influence the theory of hybrid globalization are specified. Rawls' arguments about the nature of reason, equality, justice, pluralism might reconceptualize the hybridization process in the contemporary world community. The authors find another point in understanding hybrid globalization in W. Kymlicka's notion of liberal culturalism concensus, which points out the mixing structures of the contemporary heterogeneous global world order. An important idea is also connected with the analysis of hybrid globalization in the context of Post-Marxist issues, which argue that ethnic identities are not pure or static constructions but change in new circumstances or by sharing the social space with other heritages or influence. "Blackness", for example, is a syncretic identity for it has been influenced by dominant European white cultural forms. This lack of pure identities means that minority groups are not homogeneous constructions. And this provides a strong argument for heterogeneous globalization (instead of homogeneous one). Further argument is connected with the diversity of the contemporary political life and political positions. This process leads to the formation of democratic federalism and hybrid globalization. Another point is connected with contemporary discussions on human rights in the context of cultural values, identities, the democratic theory. The modern globalization process leads to a collapse of Eurocentrism. Human rights are connected with any culture, so multicultural human rights provide for the emergence of hybrid globalization. In the conclusion, the authors summarize the results and come to the key point that the existing type of universalistic, homogeneous globalization is replaced by the new type of hybrid globalization.

ID SCHIZOPHRENIA; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; HALLUCINATIONS
AB The current situation in philosophy is largely due to the invasion of other sciences, for example, psychology and psychiatry, of its field. The paper discusses the common subject of both philosophy and psychiatry: the investigations of the Self. Philosophical phenomenology and transcendentalism analyze the transcendental Ego or the transcendental unity of apperception, whereas the current philosophy of mind offers models in which the Self is absent (Daniel Dennett's multiple drafts model). It is supposed that psychiatric data can enrich philosophical theories of the Self and help to choose between the two models of mind: with the center of control and without it. The article discusses the theories of the Self and its disturbances, which phenomenological psychiatrists develop. The school of the Danish psychiatrist Josef Parnas develops the theory of the levels of the Self: the lowest - core (minimal) Self, the medium and the highest - reflexive Self. The disturbances of minimal Self, which can be also named the disturbances of the transcendental unity of apperception, are shown to cause depersonalization, mental automatisms, voices and incoherent speech. The disturbances affect two aspects: the subjective feeling of the absence of the Self (depersonalization, mental automatism) and the absence of the working organizing mechanism itself (schizophasia, disorganized thoughts). There are complex relations between minimal Self and reflexive Self in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Whilst minimal Self diminishes, reflexive Self can increase and block spontaneous reactions. The disturbances of the Self in the delusional disorder are more complex, possible without the weakened minimal Self. Hallucinations are interpreted as the sounding of thoughts, which, in turn, results from the weakening of the inhibition of the primary sounding nature of thinking. The necessity of the temporal horizon of the Self is also analyzed, as well as its importance for the organization of thinking and the weakening of the temporal horizon in schizophrenia. The article concludes that there is an organizing center of mind, which refutes Dennett's model.

AB Introduction. Ethnosociological monitoring in a polyethnic region is conducted not only due to the need for an assessment of the public policy regulation in this field, but also due to the increase in the heuristic potential for preventing various kinds of social conflicts. The objective of the paper is to identify the dynamics of the development of interethnic relations in the Republic of Mordovia and the influence of various stratification processes on the development of ethnic relations, based on a comparative analysis of scientific studies.
   Materials and Methods. Regular sociological measurements carried out by the Research Institute of Regionology under Ogarev Mordovia State University and by the Scientific Center for Social and Economic Monitoring in 1990-2010 were used as the research materials. The interpretation of the results was carried out using the institutional, comparative and natural historical methods.
   Results. The main trends in the development of mass consciousness of the population of a polyethnic region in the context of various socio-political periods of the development of Russia have been revealed: from the 'parade of sovereignties' that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union to the reactualization of the ideology of a strong multiethnic Russian state. It has been emphasized that over the years, the main reasons exerting a negative impact on the nature of interethnic relations have mainly been not the interethnic conflicts, but the politically or economically marked factors (the economic crisis, inflation, appointment to managerial posts based on the ethnicity of a person, income inequality between representatives of different ethnic origins, etc.).
   Discussion and Conclusion. Although interethnic relations in the Republic of Mordovia has almost never achieved an increased level of conflict, the republic's leadership was able to build an effective system for regulating them, which made it possible to minimize the degree of social and ethnic tension in society. The article may be useful to scientists and practitioners in the field of the development of interethnic relations and to all those interested in the issues of ethnosociology.

DE Kantian linguistic tradition; Peter Strawson; descriptive metaphysics;
   transcendental intermediary; tradition
AB The article presents a research upon the Kantian linguistic tradition for philosophy of language in Peter Strawson's theory of descriptive metaphysics and conceptual scheme seen as a new stage in the evolution of philosophy of language. The aim of the article is to justify the existence of the Kantian linguistic tradition as a tendency for analytic philosophy. Mikhail Smimov's thesis of the non-Kantian linguistic tradition in the philosophy of language is refuted. Smimov's arguments are under discussion because his perception of the Kantian linguistic tradition and the language philosophy lead to their misinterpretation, for the Kantian philosophy and the theory of Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf (taken as the issue of philosophy of language) differ in their basis. Hence, Smimov's premise is false a priori. Kant's philosophy itself is contradictory and presents no syncretic theory as a system. This leads to various interpretations of Kant's philosophy as different possible trends in analytic philosophy. The central issue of reality and its perception in analytic philosophy derives from the Kantian tradition. The latter is developed by Strawson in his theory of descriptive metaphysics, transcendental logic and conceptual scheme. Strawson transforms Kant's metaphysics, associates logical categories with grammar. Strawson eliminates the ambiguity of Kant's theory and develops his theory of a priori judgments. Empirical judgements in the insight appear implicit. Kant's influence upon Strawson confirms the existence of the Kantian linguistic tradition as a tendency in analytic philosophy. In his paper "The Individuals", Strawson elaborates categories for the structure of his theory's scheme of concepts being the insight essence of both logical and linguistic origin, studies speech and distinguishes particulars from universals that denote various objects of reality and their qualities as well as the subject and the predicate. According to Strawson, tine and space are represented as conceptual linguistic categories. Strawson's conceptual scheme was borrowed by cognitive linguistics. Strawson excludes relativism. His descriptive metaphysics justifies the ontological significance of language as it reflects reality. As a stage in philosophy of language, Kant presents the category of modality. The transcendentalism of the Kantian subject transforms into the transcendentalism of the intermediary (language).

DE language; languages; language features; language ideology; national
   building; integrationism; segregationism
AB The subject of this article is a criticism of modernist language ideology, which leads to a new concept of the social ontology of language. The central theme is the rethinking of understanding languages as autonomous entities and closed systems. The author's methodology is based on the theory of ontological constructivism and a metadiscursive approach to the description of languages as ideological constructs based on nationalist ideologies of the 18th-19th centuries. The problem of language differentiation is considered in the context of the dichotomy of segregationism and integrationism. The author adheres to integrationism, which understands language not as an a priori system associated with territory, nation and ethnic group, but as an integral property of social interaction. The objectives of the article are related to criticism of the main theses of segregationism: firstly, the idea of languages as natural organisms; secondly, the ideas of the identity of languages, nations, cultures and territories; and, thirdly, the process of naming and counting languages. The author proves that the concepts of "language" and "languages" are closely related to traditional Western linguistic, political and cultural backgrounds. If the modern understanding of "languages" was invented in the era of nation building, then the current global changes suggest a new form of this construct. A shift is taking place from "languages" to "language features", showing the importance of everyday communication. To look at language as a practice is to view language as an activity rather than a structure, as something we do rather than a system we draw on, as a material part of social and cultural life rather than an abstract entity. Criticism of traditional linguistic ideology is necessary to rethink human being in the modern world.

DE advertising; marketing; media; information security of children
AB The article deals with the conflict between the social institution of advertising and the information security of children. The sociological aspects of the conflict under consideration are associated with the transformation of media influences in general and advertising information in particular, with children's vulnerability to advertising influences that force them to consume. Children, according to the author, act as a non-target audience of such advertising, which most often does not correspond to public ideas about decency, but, with the public nature of the distribution of advertising, children are its forced consumers. It is also noted that the growing mediatization of the living space requires the improvement of the mechanism of social control over advertising, including expert councils under the antimonopoly authority. An attempt is made to analyze the existing state of public control over advertising, which primarily requires additional qualification due to its ambiguity in terms of public morality. For this purpose, the research of quantitative indicators of expert councils' activities in all 84 territorial administrations of the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia is carried out. The research was based on information materials posted on the official websites of Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service. The composition of the expert councils was evaluated as an indicator of the effectiveness and quality of decisions they make. Also, when considering the existing mechanism of social control over advertising, the provisions of normative acts regulating the information sphere to protect children from harmful information and advertising turnover were compared. The insufficiency of social control carried out by expert councils as bodies of public control is stated. The insufficiency is expressed in the inadequacy of the composition of the councils, extremely rare meetings, inattention to informing the public about the activities of the Federal Antimonopoly Service and expert councils on advertising, the closed nature of the activities of the councils, the lack of opportunities to join the council or public monitoring of the work of the councils.

DE Russian migrants; Germany; Russia; post-Soviet space; integration;
   return tendencies
AB The article presents an attempt to consider the re-emigration potential of Russian-speaking groups living in Germany. The main attention is given to the privileged groups (from an ethnic perspective) and, in particular, to "Russian Germans" and "Russian Jews". Qualitative methodology is the basis of the conducted research work and the analysis. The analyzed basis is 43 interviews done in Munich in 2005-6 and in 2011 with representatives of the above mentioned groups. The article aims at revealing the nature of interaction between the Russian-speaking groups and the residents of the country of exodus in Germany and the formats in which these interactions are held. It takes into consideration not only the direct contacts of the respondents, but also the tendencies to get information about different aspects of the political, economic and social life in the countries of exodus and the attitude to a possible re-emigration to the country of exodus. The article shows different activity tendencies of these groups towards the exodus countries. The authors assume that Russian-speaking groups not only keep in touch with the people in the exodus countries but also tend to expand and strengthen these relationships. But in some cases the basis for such tendencies is not the wish of the migrants to return to these countries but their striving for participating in the trans-national migrant community life. This presupposes the formation of some certain "social niches" in the countries of exodus and residence to exist between the abandoned society and the host country. In this case, the re-migrant potential of the Russian-speaking groups is not high. The authors focus on the possibility of influencing migrants living in the countries of new settlement by communities of the exodus countries. Much attention is given to the fact that the Russian-speaking individuals who came to Germany from the CIS countries can choose among the exodus countries no matter which part of the former USSR they left. In this case, the Russian vector is the most determining. It reveals that migrants who did not come from Russia and do not have Russian citizenship may show the tendency of returning to Russia, which they never left. The article shows that the national policies of the abandoned societies may directly influence migrants thus forming new social attitudes and sentiments.

DE counter-power; terrorist networks; violence; discourse
AB Taking into account the risk potential and the destructiveness of terrorism, as well as the factor of its progressive development, the task of an intellectual reflection on enhancing knowledge about the phenomenon acquires scientific significance. The issue is especially relevant for terrorism of a jihadist type, demonstrating a transition from a regime of dispersed local and sporadically manifested cases of dictate of will to a level of permanent geopolitical influence. The aim of the article is to verify the hypothesis of the possibility of explication of jihadist terrorism as a counter-power. The methodological guideline for the study was the provisions of Manuel Castells's communication network concept resonating with the network and digital dynamics of the present. To substantiate the assumptions and conclusions, the author of the article appeals to sources of information concerning the most important aspects of terrorism: reports and accounts of the UN, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, analytical data of foreign and Russian expert communities, research centers and institutions, and media materials. Valuable material was also received from research articles on the topics under study. The article includes several logically interconnected parts. At the beginning of the text, the need for the evolution of a heuristic that works to reinforce the existing theoretical ideas about the object of study is problematized. Attention is focused on Castells's views relevant in terms of their applicability to the present analysis. Further, the essential manifestations of jihadist terrorism are indicated that show that this type of terrorism acquired the status of a counter-power. Based on the factual material, the idea is proved that the terrorist community is building a meta-capital and becoming a political counteragent that influences the global and regional processes, forms networks and acts as a trans-communicative center for radical consolidation and integration. By organically complementing the tactics of direct violence with discourse practices, terrorists reprogram the consciousness of recipients, which determines the multiplication of the nongovernmental component in different societies. Finally, a conclusion is drawn on the transformation of jihadist terrorism toward asserting itself as a force challenging the dominance of the institutionally organized order.

DE moral responsibility; free will; attribution of responsibility;
   principle of alternate possibilities; reactive attitudes; objective
   attitudes
AB The article discusses some stages in the study of the topic of moral responsibility. The cases of Frankfurt and Fischer on the status of moral responsibility in the absence of alternative possibilities are considered. A version of the interpretation of the Frankfurt case based on the constructivist methodology is proposed. This version is built on two positions: (a) we can deal only with forms of knowledge, and not with access to reality itself; (b) the criterion of the reliability of knowledge is associated with its applicability, and not with the correspondence to reality. A solution to the Frankfurt case is proposed. If no one knows that someone controls Jones's activities, then we can hold Jones responsible for his actions. If we know that Black controls Jones's actions, then we believe that Jones is not responsible for his actions. We believe that responsibility matters when there are real alternatives. Such alternatives involve responsibilities, obligations and risks, but, in this example, there are no such risks. It is argued that the Fischer and Frankfurt cases show the dependence of responsibility attribution on our beliefs of who is considered morally responsible and why. These cases discuss the situation in which moral responsibility does not require the sort of control which involves the existence of alternative possibilities. A change in the study of the problem of responsibility, made in Peter Strawson's discussion of reactive and objective attitudes, is shown. Strawson's commentators noted that his strategy in "Freedom and Resentment" involves turning away from the conceptual issues of the analysis of "freedom" and "responsibility" and taking a closer look at what actually goes on when we hold a person responsible. By reactive attitudes Strawson means certain emotional reactions individuals to other individuals' actions in relation to them. Among them, he emphasizes gratitude and resentment. Reactive attitudes are natural forms of the emotional interaction of "adults". Attitudes towards actions due to causes external for individuals are called objective. Strawson believed that moral attitudes can be considered as generalized or vicarious analogues of personal reactive attitudes. It is noted that Strawson's paper marked a turn in the debate on responsibility from analyzing the relationship of free will and determinism to the phenomenology of interpersonal relationships constituting responsibility. Marion Smiley's ideas about the nature of responsibility were also examined. Smiley claims responsibility is attributed. This procedure depends on our sociopolitical interests. Smiley insists on the dependence of such interests on both our configuration of the individual's social role and our own sense of whether or not those being harmed are part of the individual's community. As a result, a shift is shown in the discussion of responsibility status, which links it not only with the action agent as the cause of harm, but also with those action agents who can participate in limiting or preventing harm.

DE Portugal; April Revolution; internal and external changes; role in
   international relations; trade and economic ties with Russia
AB In 2019, 45 years of the "Carnation Revolution" (the Revolution in the Portuguese Republic on April 25, 1974) - an outstanding historical event of national and cross-border scale - are celebrated. The Portuguese Revolution resulted from both the internal development of the Portuguese Republic and a chain of important historical events on a global level. The end of the World War II, the collapse of fascism, struggle for elimination of the colonial system led mankind to understanding the need for social and political modernization. A fresh wind of change in the early 1970s also touched Portugal. The past decades have shown that the April Revolution was part of a global process of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes collapse in all regions of the world, known as the "third wave of democratization". The value of Portuguese events went beyond one country. They were the impetus for the development of democratic processes in other regions, particularly in Europe and South America. The "Carnation Revolution" launched the process of decolonization that has created on the site of the Portuguese colonies a number of independent states. During the relatively small period (by historical standards), Portugal has made significant progress in economic and social spheres, has established a stable political system capable of responding to external and internal challenges. Because of the democratic transformation, a decrepit colonial empire with a closed authoritarian regime was transformed into a country open to the world, with a European-style political system which respects the rule of law, guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms for citizens. The Portuguese have changed without changing themselves, preserving the national identity and traditions, the unique place that the country occupies in world history and at present. The Revolution has not only changed the trajectory, but also radically expanded the horizons of interaction between Lisbon, the states of the European continent and other parts of the world. In the current, extremely complex international situation, Portugal aims to strengthen its position on the world stage, expand the circle of trade, economic and political counterparts. One of important partners in the system of Portugal's foreign economic ties is the Russian Federation. Despite many problems of the last time, Russian-Portuguese relations based on mutual interest maintain positive dynamics.

DE Suriname; a multiracial society; ethnic groups; Javanese; labor

AB The relevance of the topic is determined by the widespread development of migration processes in the modern conditions of globalization and multiculturalism. One of the relatively unexplored and almost unknown in our country manifestations of these processes is the Javanese community in Suriname, which, on the one hand, is increasingly susceptible to creolization, on the other, is still distinguished by its originality, and supported at the religious level. The paper uses a systematic approach, which is based on the consideration of an object as an integral complex of interrelated elements, as well as the historical and comparative method. The scientific novelty of the article is determined both by the weak study of the topic in domestic science and by the complex review based on various sources and research. The author draws attention to the complexity of the adaptation processes of Javanese people in Suriname, which at a certain stage caused the self-isolation of this community. The situation changed after the Second World War, when, under conditions of increasing political activity of all ethnic groups of the country, the activity of Javanese leaders intensified. In terms of urbanization, young generations of Javanese are increasingly seeking to enter the Creole environment, which increases the possibilities of vertical mobility. At the same time, religious differentiation occurs when a part of Javanese people undergo secularization and Christianization, while the other is included in the process of re-Islamization

DE skills deployment; skills formation; professional training; labor
   market; qualification systems; returns to education
AB In this book, the issues of skills formation and utilization in the system of formal education and in the labor market are discussed. The recent mainstream concepts of skills are critically analyzed alongside the less known, alternative perspectives. The book addresses several myths related to skills formation and deployment. The first one concerns the relationship between skills and wages; the second is about the demand for "soft" skills in the future economy; the third one addresses the growth of high-skilled jobs; and the fourth one looks at supply-led skills policies. In the handbook, the necessity of a paradigmatic shift from skills formation towards their better utilization is discussed across the fields of education sciences, economics, and political studies. Based on the analysis of recent empirical evidence, the authors elaborate the concepts of social construction of skills, "skills ecosystems," capabilities and skills, and others. The authors compare institutions and skills policies, including the systems of qualifications, in various countries. Still, most of the empirical illustrations and theoretical concepts presented in the book refer rather to the developed market economies, whereas the analysis of the situation in other countries, in particular, in BRICS, is quite limited. Nevertheless, the handbook is without doubt of high interest to the Russian readership, as it is, probably, the first successful attempt to systematize and critically reassess the existing knowledge in the fields of skills formation and utilization.

The authors consider the specific characteristics of corporate democracy in Russia, as systems of functional representation, compare this analysis with other models and concepts of corporate forms of democracy. It is argued that modern "corporate" structures, as an integral part of the functional representation system, are a transitive form of sociopolitical transformation, leading both to the formation of a "democracy of owners" and a "managed democracy".

DT Article
DE national identity; cultural identity; civic identity; migration; France
AB National identity is one of the most pressing themes in the socio-political discourse in modem France. The current sense of identity crisis is associated with the processes of globalisation, the unification of culture on a global scale, the building of a European identity within the EU, as well as with the incoming mass migration of non-European origin which brings in people different from the local French population in terms of both culture and religion. The impact of these factors, especially migration, has become so tangible it necessitated a new understanding of the very meaning of the concept of 'national identity'. This meaning is conceived of differently from different ideological perspectives which the article undertakes to analyse drawing on various sources including press publications and online comments, Internet portals of a number of public organisations, social sciences literature, and other texts. It identifies and examines two main models of national identity, discussing their content and interpretation, and concludes that the issues of interpretation of identity go far beyond theoretical debates, turning out to be ideological and, ultimately, political, and the future that the country aspires to depends on how these issues are understood.

AB This article presents an analysis of the socio-economic specifics and political and legal characteristics of a traditional state. The authors illustrate the latter on a vast array of historical examples from the evolution and development of the ancient and medieval states. The authors substantiate that the key feature of traditional states is the absence of the state apparatus in its classical political and legal interpretation. At the same time, using various historical examples, the traditional state, and its public-imperious organization has been proved to base on an extensive system of personal relations and property basis, which was legally documented and represented in the socio-political reality in the land ownership. The absence of public service and, accordingly, state-service relations in the traditional state, in our opinion, was the reason that its state apparatus was not its structural and organizational basis. It seems that this feature should be considered one of the main typological characteristics of the traditional state. In science, however, it is stated that such indivisibility of managerial and economic functions had, allegedly, a place only at the earliest stages of statehood. Gradually, as the state develops, there is a distinction between private and public law functions of the state, due, among other things, to the separation of private property of the ruler from the property of the state (treasury).

DE national sovereignty; cyberspace; national jurisdiction; cyber net
AB The key idea of the study is the question of the relationship between such categories as "national sovereignty" and "cyberspace". The authors consider that the current theory of law and positive legal regulation at the present stage do not offer reasonable options for interaction and coexistence of these concepts.
   In the conditions of the dramatic changes in the existing realities over the past 30 years, the question arises of the differentiation of legal regulation, which is still more intended to the social relations that existed in the 20th century. Today technical progress is significantly ahead of social, in particular, legal regulation, which, in turn, is seriously tied to the state or, as any law student confirms, "territorial organization of power in a society with sovereignty...". And here the main question arises about the reasonableness of the above formulation. Is it suitable for existing realities? Or is it itself an obstacle to legalization? The article analyzes various approaches to the legal settlement of relations in cyberspace, as well as offers two options for supranational regulation of these legal relations - through the development and establishment of an extraterritorial international body that will have not only the ability to control public relations within cyberspace, but also special instruments of coercion to influence the citizens of any state, either through the creation of a global system of international acts that will regulate most of the existing questions about the interaction of persons in cyberspace and included a clear mechanism to respond quickly to the emergence of new relations in this sphere.
   The authors also consider that the inability at theoretical level to conceptualize the relationship between these categories could lead to the discrediting of such notions as "national state" and "national sovereignty" in the future.

In the early 1920s, there was an influential Russian medical community in Harbin that established medical societies and medical schools. The organization of medical societies was a part of the active formation of a professional community and represented a thoughtful measure for countering the control of Chinese officials. The high degree of cooperation between Russian and Chinese medical personnel in the medical-sanitary department of the Chinese Eastern Railway and in Harbin municipal medical facilities was a part of Harbin physicians' activities.

In the author's opinion, political leadership factor that is typical for the Arab-Israeli world is instrumental in providing a conceptual framework for peace talks between Israel and Palestine in the context of globalization. The article focuses on the peculiarities of the Islamic model of political or, to be more precise, religious and political leadership and how it can be implemented to give a new impetus to the currently bogged down Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The author argues that is impossible to achieve any tangible regional treaty because not all the arrangements concerning Palestine have a legitimate character from the point of view of both the Palestinians and the people of other Muslim countries in the world. Therefore, in the author's opinion, without using such an innovative model of the negotiation process it will be principally impossible to achieve a final settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

TI POLITICAL JUSTICE FOR OTFRIED HEFFE
SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-PRAVO-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF LAW
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Heffe; justice; positivism; anarchism; transcendental exchange
AB Otfried Heffe (born 1943) is a German social philosopher and ethics specialist who examines the problem of political justice.
   Theory of Justice Heffe seems to be completely in line with the Kantian tradition.
   The thinker distinguishes between personal and institutional types of justice: The first is to understand the criterion of individual actions, and the second criterion for the correctness of social institutions (political justice, concerning the assessments of law and the state, is part of it).
   Also, Heffe notes the universal connection of law with loyalty to his own community, with solidarity. But solidarity, like morality, can only be asked, and we demand justice.
   The basic principle of political justice, Heffe formulates as a principle of impartiality, he is also the principle of equal rights to freedom, he is also the principle of distributively advantageous free existence. The scientist believes that there are certain categorical legal principles that can serve as a counterpoint of modernity.
   Justice, according to Heffe, lies in the structure of a society in which social benefits and public authorities to one degree or another benefit everyone, so everyone can agree with such a scenario for mature thinking.
   Heffe's just social order is directly related to democracy, which is understood not by "majority tyranny", but by "enlightened liberal" constitutional democracy.
   At the heart of Heffe's views is the concept of "transcendental exchange", which is the following. Social power is justified only when those it extends to can accept it. But this requires the ability to agree. In other words, social power must recognize in the people subordinate to it subjects of law, capable persons. Capacity implies basic rights.
   According to Heffe, positivism is erroneous, since power orders, which lack a well-known layer of justice, can not be considered public legal communities. Where there is a division into objects of coercion on the one hand, and persons from coercion of the winners, on the other hand, there is no even basic justice, and therefore the legal nature of the corresponding rules cannot be said. The legal form itself implies coercion, which serves the common distributive interests. The definition of right by attributing it to the ideal of justice is highly debatable.
   As part of the debunk of anarchism, Heffe attempts to justify the very existence of the state and law. Here the scientist again repels from Kant, who claimed that the right is connected with the right to coerce. But to justify it, it is necessary to prove that it will be beneficial for all. Heffe does this by reference to empirical data. It is also necessary to justify that coercion should come from the State through a legal form. Heffe does this by analyzing the "ticket-free problem" associated with public goods.
   According to the author of the article, Heffe correctly defined justice as a benefit for everyone, proposed a noteworthy way of justifying the basic human rights and the objective ideals of freedom and equality, but criticism of positivism and anarchism raise questions and objections.

AB The article deals with the features of the recent elections to the European Parliament in the Visegrad group. Having joined the EU relatively recently, these States (Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic), despite the "velvet revolutions" desire "to return to Europe", during the previous elections to the European Parliament did not show due interest in election campaigns. On the contrary, they showed rather detachment from this form of participation in European life. The analysis of root causes of this electoralapproach, as well as the growing activity during the last election campaign, are in the focus of the authors' research. According to authors, the results of the 2019 elections might be considered as a symptom of upcoming important changes in the relations between V4 and Brussels, which is due to a number of international factors, as well as the completion of the process of political and economic convergence. An important reason for the high electoral turnout in Poland and Hungary is also the desire of the citizens to gain the opportunity to more decisively defend their national interests, as well as to influence the process of EU reform. The simultaneous use of regional and country approaches enables the authors to identify specific features of the development of the socio-political space of Central Europe at the present stage.

AB The article problematizes the functioning, on the one hand, of traditional value-normative regulators, ensuring socio-cultural integrity and social and political dynamics, and on the other, the development of standards for the development and application of digital algorithms, autonomous robotic systems and artificial intelligence. It discusses various approaches and theoretical and practical positions that argue and model the development of a socio-political organization in the digital era, and describe fundamental changes in political communication, law and order, public-power interaction, etc.
   The authors argue that the introduction of digital algorithms and robotic technologies radically changes the basic sociocultural meanings and the socio-political landscape, the formation of new types of social relations, where people, things, machines together form special modes of functioning, specific relations. The work proves that these cardinal changes require fundamentally new theoretical and methodological approaches to research, and new tools for political modeling and forecasting. The problems of legislative and ethical regulation of the processes of informatization and technological development of the society are discussed separately. The final part of the research shows that modernity poses the fundamental problem of correlating digital and socio-cultural trends in the development of political space, their contradictions and the inevitable convergence of socio-cultural, traditional socio-political dominants of development with digital trends and life forms. The article proves that harmonization of existing value-normative regulators and standards of digital algorithms and artificial intelligence systems being developed is necessary, since the latter can be a key guarantee for the formation of an effective system of social system development and its stability in the digital age.

DE forecasting; topic modelling; TF-IDF; art; culture; modern cultural

AB In the middle of the twentieth century, there is a need to develop methods of sociocultural forecasting in order to construct future management. Forecasting is widely used in the economic, social, political, and cultural spheres. Culture represent one of the essential components of the spiritual life of society. Therefore, forecasting in this area can make a significant contribution to identifying trends and priorities in the development of the processes of creating and mastering art by people, training and educating creative youth, preserving and popularizing artifacts of culture.
   This article describes an experiment able to identify ideas about perspective directions of development of the artistic environment soon and to allocate the most typical expectations of rising generation of intellectual elite of the socio-cultural situation, described in the creative essay.
   By clustering algorithms and automatic feature extraction methods, the task was realized. The experiment was attended by students of artistic areas (socio-cultural activities, art history, cultural studies) - the "creators" and non-artistic - "consumers" (political science, sociology, journalism, metallurgy, applied computer science). Total 430 texts were used in the study.
   An analysis of the results of the algorithm led to the following conclusions. The texts of the students of the group of "creators" included reflections on the questions that the process of artistic creation, the structure and functions of the institutions for the preservation and popularization of cultural heritage would remain unchanged. At the same time, in the texts of the second group - "consumers", it was possible to find clearer and more interesting images of future cultural institutions and artistic practices, as well as products of creative activity. The results obtained are related to the fact that the interest of the second group of students is associated with increased reflexivity. Such results do not indicate the limitations of the "creators", but only emphasize the need to study the artistic tastes, needs and aesthetic expectations of the "consumers", the growth of dialogue and the culture of creative complicity (participation) between these two groups of people.
   Also, in creative works, it was possible to find exhibition projects that made a serious impression on students and became significant for the cultural environment of the city. After detailed study of these data we can understand what characteristics and levels of the organization must have the events that can in the long run have a serious impact on the cultural life of the city.

AB The academic Marxism of the 20th century has shied away from this responsibility, preferring relatively comfortable staying within the walls of universities. Unlike these academic thinkers Samir Amin was one of the few who did not accept this situation. He never considered himself merely a theorist: connection to praxis was vital for him. From this perspective he advocated a project of Fifth International to address sharp and systemic crisis afflicting leftist movements. Each new stage of the evolution of capitalism requires a corresponding transformation of the anti-capitalist forces. Nevertheless, a new political alternative can't be constructed artificially. It can only gradually emerge out of collective experience of different struggles.

It should be mentioned that military actions between those two countries in ancient times did not necessarily lead to the interruption of trade relations. Results clearly demonstrates the complexity of the study of military and political factors' influence on the trade relations of specific regions and tribes, which allows us to identify the most important problems and ways to further research.

DE political marketing; political technologies; networks; simulation;

AB The article is devoted to modern approaches to the study of political marketing, including the analysis of current political technologies, as well as the opportunities and limitations associated with their implementation. Such technologies are of particular relevance in the political process of post-modernity described in the categories of hierarchy, performativity, contextuality, discreteness and simulation. According to the authors, political marketing today is increasingly becoming an object of interdisciplinary research, in particular, it is actively considered from the point of view of synergy (the general theory of self-organization). The authors conclude that currently there is an active update of the main campaigns and concepts of political marketing. Patterns found in the analysis from the point of view of the system-synergistic activity of a modern changeable and non-linear context within which political marketing strategies are implemented deserve separate consideration: (1) The power of the administrative resource and the variety of informal contacts and connections among the subjects of political marketing do not always ensure the successful implementation of political marketing strategies in a changing society. (2) Of particular importance in this situation are the "point-like" measures of influence on the imbalanced politicians and the public space when, to achieve the goal, the deliberate and skillful nudging of an unstable system that is ready for profound changes (public sphere, public opinion, electorate's sentiment) in the direction necessary for political actors is required rather than a massive intervention. (3) Political marketing is effective when the infrastructure of the influence of the power or of powerless political actors is consolidated, that is, when all resources (political, economic, symbolic capitals) are brought together and work on a single task (electoral, political, administrative). (4) The condition for a successful use of political marketing is reliance on soft power technology. An attractive and consistent image of political power, consistently fixed in the minds of potential voters and in public opinion, affirmed within the public sphere using a symbolic capital, is needed.
   According to the authors, the key conditions for the effectiveness of political marketing technologies are, respectively: (1) the timeliness of advocacy impacts (political marketing actors need to be proactive in modeling the desired state of public opinion on significant issues); (2) the complex and systemic impact on the opinions of potential voters, its linking with a wide range of problems that really concern the latter; (3) the adequacy and proportionality of the implemented marketing effects of the current social and political situation and the structure of the political moment; (4) the density and intensity of marketing influences, their focus on certain problem situations and reference groups that allow changing the popular mood and the political situation among potential voters in relatively short periods of time by displacing undesirable opinions and attitudes to the periphery of the public space; (5) the ability to create, reproduce and relay non-contradictory political discourses associated with value ideas shared by potential voters; (6) the clear articulation of the position of a political actor implementing marketing strategies on contemporary challenges and problems, the putting forward of a positive and constructive alternative to current challenges and problems, policies, strategies and approaches.

DE signification; meaning; Whately; Mill; Meinong; Marty; Frege
ID MEINONGS HUME
AB The article traces some principal points of the history of the development of terms and conceptions which served as the basis for German logical doctrines of semantics in the 1890s. The first part of the article considers the theory of signification inside English logic and the deformations it underwent when translated into German. Semantic issues were part of logic in the British tradition because the latter used to view the subject of logic as a reasoning, and language as the only bearer of that reasoning. In addition, the theory of signification was an important part of British modern philosophy. These approaches were incorporated into logic by Richard Whately, but with some modifications. He in fact reduced signification to denotation and, in order to explicate the nature of common names, introduced the notion of class into logic. It was John Stuart Mill who explicitly developed the logical theory of signification. He did not share Whately's radical nominalism and founded his theory not on class, but on the distinction of two kinds of signification: denotation, or direct way of representing an object, and connotation, which does the same work indirectly, via attributes. Along with signification, he introduced the concept of meaning into logic. When Mill's and classical British philosophers' works were translated into German, some terminological shifts crept in. The difference between signification and meaning disappeared in the German text of Mill's Logic, and between signification and denotation in the German translation of Berkeley. The second part of the article considers some treatments of the name theory in the school of Brentano. On the material of Meinong's doctoral thesis of 1877, the author traces how British issues were adapted in continental philosophy. Namely, he tries to intepret the British discussion of abstract ideas in terms of "Inhalt" and "Umfang", which were alien for British logic and philosophy. As a consequence, he came to a conclusion principally foreign for the latter: object and idea should be viewed as different sides of signification. On the material of Anton Marty's article on subjectless propositions, published in 1884, the author attracts attention to the possible influence of linguistic theories of meaning on the logical semantic theories. The principal idea of Marty's doctrine is that of a need in a mediating link between a sign and its meaning which he called "etymon". He describes the meaning as a secondary function of a sign while an etymon as a primary one. Different words with different etymons can have the same meaning. The sentence is a kind of a name; consequently, it has an etymon as well. Thus, there is an evident formal correspondence between Frege's logical semantics and Marty's linguistic semantics. Finally, the author gives some arguments for the idea that Frege was acquainted with the considered ideas of Meinong and Marty.

AB Scientific approaches and methods for studying environmental risks are defined. The research used paradigmatic and institutional approaches to the study of the ecological situation in extreme conditions, sociological theories of risk society, the ecological imperatives of Christian and Buddhist cultures. The ecological situation in the Baikal region was studied, and the sources of pollution of the water area and the coast of Lake Baikal were examined, indicating an increase in the anthropogenic load on the ecosystem. On the basis of a sociological survey, an assessment of the environmental situation was given, the respondents' attitudes toward environmental risks were identified, socio-economic and environmental threats were rated, and measures to improve the environmental situation were revealed. The inhabitants of the region, in contrast to the country as a whole, assess the current environmental situation in the area of residence more negatively. The respondents consider the authorities primarily responsible for the problem ecological zones, negatively refer to the risk-producers, advocate tough measures against violators of the environmental laws. Despite the growth of the volunteer movement, public initiatives in the field of ecology, environmental pessimism, some alienation from nature is typical for the inhabitants of the region. The risks of economic activity on the coast of Lake Baikal, environmental practices of the population in everyday life are considered. The main part of the population did not have to participate in environmental events, at the same time they expressed their readiness to take part in them. The author comes to the conclusion that the region lacks effective state control over the rational use of natural resources and the ecological state of Lake Baikal. In society, there is not enough moral responsibility for the state of the environment, elements of the "junk culture" predominate. It is important to increase the responsibility of the state and society for the ecological state of the environment.

AB The article attempts to give, if possible, the universal system of both the existing and any possible futurology. Its universality is determined by the fact that one of the scenarios of the future within it must necessarily take place. There are two "layers" of the corresponding direction of thought, which are designated as "short-range futurology" and "long-range futurology". The natural dependence of futurology on the state of society and on the priority directions of the development of science and technology is shown. The former and the latter largely determine the people's mood and their expectations from tomorrow. For example, for the early futurology of the late 1950s-1960s, hopes for the "cosmic" future of the humankind are more characteristic; for the later one (from the 1970s and especially from the 1980s) the hopes are for the "computer" future. Overviews are given of forecasts for the coming decades (the concepts of postindustrial, or informational, society and technological singularity are the main ones here) and tables of some ultimate prospects that outline though not the entire but at least the significant part of the futurological "field". The distinctive features of the emerging postindustrial society, the social problems intrinsic for its initial (modern) stage of development, the ambiguous results of the too rapid introduction of various technologies into life are shown. The basis for the typology of future scenarios is the astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev's classification (proposed in 1964) of space civilizations in terms of energy consumption. The intelligent activity variations analyzed by Kardashev are regarded in the article as possible scenarios of the future of the terrestrial humankind. There are four cardinal versions: Infinitive Expansion (unlimited development with the capture of more and more new areas of life), Autarchy (closure within the solar system and reduction of growth to zero in all directions), Degradation (wildness, return to the "bosom of nature") and, finally, Termination (destruction).

DE monism; panprotopsychism; the combination problem
AB In this article, the authors consider neutral monism in the context of the discussion between realism and antirealism. Neutral monism is a theory of mind which opposes both physicalism and dualism: unlike dualism, it does not divide substances; unlike physicalism, it does not deny the existence of qualia. This approach to the mind was developed in works of Bertrand Russell and David Chalmers. Russell argues that physics does not reveal the intrinsic nature of fundamental entities but only the external relations between them. He states that consciousness and physical properties are the same thing, the mere two aspects of neutral entities. Chalmers has elaborated Russell's approach into panprotopsychism. According to this theory, consciousness is constituted by protophenomenal properties which, along with microphysical properties, constitute macrophysical properties.
   The main problem of panprotopsychism is the combination problem which challenges the existence of constitutive properties. Neutral monism, at first thought, proposes a simple and elegant ontology that might be helpful when dealing with the mind-body problem; although, as Priest pointed, this theory has only one weakness - it does not explain what neutral entities exactly are. Panprotopsychism has a similar one - its defenders offer epistemologically inadequate solutions to the combination problem which do not shed light on the nature of the neutral substance. Therefore, the authors conclude that neutral monism is epistemological antirealism.

DE "soft power"; elections; election interference; meddling in election;
   influence on election; electoral behavior
AB This article is an attempt to achieve semantic certainty regarding such concepts as "electoral interference" ("interference with elections") and "influence on electoral processes". The urgency of this problem is determined by the intensification of global confrontation and the hybridization of technologies used by leading world countries in their competitive battle. One of the methods of information warfare actively used by Western countries is the public censure of their geopolitical competitors for the alleged acts of meddling in elections. The most obvious example of using this tactic is the case of the so-called Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential elections. After analyzing the claims of the American side, the authors of the article come to the conclusion that they are biased, factually untenable and illogical. They also propose to determine the appropriateness of equating external information impact on the electoral preferences of citizens to foreign intervention. The article notes that one can genuinely "interfere with elections" only by making people vote for certain candidates and parties, or by using a crude falsification of the voting results. The implementation of external electoral intervention is not likely because such aggression cannot be ignored by human rights activists, foreign observers, the expert community, the media and, finally, special services responsible for ensuring national security. Thus, phenomena mistakenly taken or deliberately disguised as interference with elections ("hard power") represent the use of "soft power". The authors of the article insist on the semantic non-identity of the concepts "interference" and "influence". The former denotes power pressure on the electoral system, and the latter symbolizes the soft informational and motivational influence of foreign subjects on the behavioral attitudes and electoral preferences of citizens. The implementation of such activities with the help of mass media and Internet resources cannot formally be qualified as "interference with elections" and does not need an apology. Consequently, it is necessary to abandon the paradigm of "electoral interference" in favor of recognizing the inevitability of a polysubject interaction of actors in the sphere of foreign and domestic policy (this influence extends to the institution of elections). Awareness of this circumstance makes leading global players' mutual accusations of their interference with electoral processes senseless.

DE concept of necessity; Michel Foucault; Hilary Putnam; Francis Wolff;
   Quentin Meillassoux
AB The meaning of an intertextual analysis is not only to contribute to a best interpretation of philosophical theories. (The author chose French philosophers Michel Foucault, Francis Wolff and Quentin Meillassoux, and American philosopher Hilary Putnam because they criticized and developed the ideas of one another). The author's aim is to show that philosophy continues to exist by arguing against and refuting claims of the "end of the human", the "end of metaphysics", the "postmodern" epoch or "poststructuralism". The author believes that this makes philosophy necessary, and this research is to prove this point. First of all, the necessity problem appears with a philosophical reflection on rationality in history. Foucault claims any historical rational structure is contingent. Then, Putnam criticizes Foucault saying that in this way there is no difference of quality between different kinds of rationalities. Wolff develops the idea of the structured rational necessity. He says that even the metaphysical principles by Aristotle and Descartes are to be considered as temporal and historical structures of rationalities. Wolff's co-author, Gilles-Gaston Granger, writes about the difference between the absoluteness of a mathematical necessity and the totality of the laws of the nature. Meillassoux radically changes Foucault's paradox claiming that there is nothing but a mathematical necessity and philosophy must stop thinking in the terms of the Kantian opposition of necessity in the nature and in the world to the contingency of the spirit.

AB The article aims to analyze the content of the concept "corruption" used in the daily life of young people and the features of this phenomenon subjectively perceived by the youth. Considering educational activities within the anti-corruption policy, the authors point out that the legitimate attitude to corruption, endowing a corrupt official's image with positive features, tolerance to participants in corruption among the youth can significantly complicate the implementation of anti-corruption activities in the education of young people. Thus, the authors identify the significant features of understanding corruption by young people and their attitude to the problem of anti-corruption in Russia. The article uses the materials of focus groups conducted with the students of the Russian humanitarian universities. The research results show that the grounds for legitimizing corruption are actualized in the space of public and private interests rather than of moral norms. The authors conclude that the transition from the sphere of public interest to the sphere of private interest erodes a clear understanding of corruption as a socially dangerous phenomenon and forms an ambivalent attitude. A fight against corruption also articulates the distinction between the fields of public and private interests. The authors emphasize that young people determine the main area of actors' responsibility for the anti-corruption policy in the macro-context, actualizing the primary role of the state and society in eliminating corruption, which indicates a weak subjective responsibility. Modern students also show ethno-cultural features when perceiving corruption.

DE "educational event"; occasion; limits of applicability; evidence
AB In the days of the "post" - post-industrial society, postmodern culture, post-non-classical science a constructive research position coincides with the "everyone-is-right" point of view. This optimism of modem epistemology is restricted only by the limits of applicability of the theories, concepts and teachings the researcher chooses to the solving of the problem. It will be an error to ignore or violate the limits of applicability. The consequence of the error will be the lack of proving and of evidence in answers to questions posed in studies. In recent years, in the publications of Russian researchers, the notion of an "educational event" has appeared; it denotes a kind of an innovation proposed for introduction into the educational practice: from the teaching and rearing of children to the educating of adults. In the article, the trajectory of introducing the concept of "educational event" is retrospectively traced. It is established that there is an equivocation in the use of the different interpretations of the concept "occasion/event", which are homonymous in the Russian language. The consequence of this equivocation is a mixture of interpretations of the "occasion / event" concept presented in Martin Heidegger's and Alfred North Whitehead's metaphysics and in Mikhail Bakhtin's philosophical conclusions. As a result, there is a mixture of interpretations of the "occasion" given by Whitehead and interpretations of the "event" in the psychology of child development. In turn, in different directions of developmental psychology, the concept "event", given by Heidegger and Bakhtin as, respectively, the event-ritual and the event-dialogue, received their own interpretations. The article successively examines the limits of applicability of the "occasion", the event-ritual and the event-dialogue in pedagogical practice. The limits of applicability are constituted by the unpredictability of the "occasion" consequences and by the purpose of the event-dialogue for individualised rearing and education. It has been established that supporters of "educational events" follow the tradition of the organization of the event-ritual that limits the novelty of their suggestions. Thereby, there are the following errors: (1) ignoring the limits of applicability and extrapolations of these interpretations of the concept "occasion/event"; (2) unpredictability of the consequences of the majority of "educational events", which indicates the existence of the problem of evidence and proving in Russian pedagogical research.

DE utopia; Trinity; sex; feminine; masculine
AB The article considers the changes in the religious foundations of society proposed in the utopian projects of Russian philosophy focusing on the interpretation of the tenet of the Trinity. For analysis, two utopias were selected (Dmitry Merezhkovsky's "The Third Kingdom" and Daniil Andreev's The Rose of the World), in which special attention is paid to the changing of the religious foundations of the future society. Merezhkovsky's project was created within the framework of the concept of the "new religious consciousness" that took shape in the philosophy of the Silver Age. Important for the philosopher is the union of religion and culture through the spiritual rebirth of man in a new society. The main goal of the project is the Kingdom of God, in which the evolution of Christianity took place, a single world church was created, the secret of sex was revealed and the harmony of nature and society was established. His religion of the "Third Testament" was to resolve all existing contradictions. The use of symbolism gives him the opportunity to reveal the significance of the religious tenet of the Trinity. In this utopia, the feminine plays a leading role, which helps trace the connection with feminist projects of the 20th century. Andreev's utopia, like Merezhkovsky's project, is built on the new religious teaching of the philosopher, which he calls interreligion. The ultimate goal is the World Brotherhood reminiscent of the ideal of the Kingdom of God. At the core is also a change in the interpretation of the tenet of the Trinity - the introduction of the Female Deity. Thus, the polarity of the two principles - male and female - manifests itself in the Divine. The philosopher examines the role of the feminine and the masculine and comes to the conclusion that they need a relative balance in the world. These are two projects offering their vision of religious ideas in the future society, which are built on the relationship in the nature of the male and female principles. Through the interpretation of the Trinity, the philosophers show the importance of the female principle in the world, its role in the harmonization of society.

DE ontology; ontological turn; game studies; cybertext; computer game
AB The main thesis of this work is the argument about the possibility of "experimental ontology" the implementation of ontological hypotheses through developments in the field of video and computer games. To do this, the author first of all gives an idea of how relevant the ontological problem in philosophy itself (Meijas, Harman, Pickering) and in the philosophy of consciousness (Menzinger) is today. She also talks about the philosophical potential of the conceptual direction in the game industry first of all, the manifesto of a "deep game". It is concluded that the general intention of the current stage of ontological problems is related to the idea of cognitive narrowness. In this context, the philosophy of consciousness is a kind of a pessimistic scenario for the development of this idea while, for ontology and conceptual developments in the field of video and computer games (PC games), this "narrowness" is an excuse for seeking its overcoming. Arguing about the ontological potential of PC games, the author bases on the current domestic tradition of understanding ontology as conditions for the understanding of experience. The specificity of PC games as a special kind of text - cybertext (Aarset) - is analyzed. PC games can be a "machine" for the production of a world that is sufficiently different to conflict with the familiar conditions of the understanding of experience (the former ontology). However, many games that claim to create "new worlds" do not imply such a conflict. This determines the following problem: what is a really different world? Heidegger's distinction between the ontical and the ontological is important to understand what game design must work on so that the "different", in the ontological sense, would mean different conditions of intelligibility. The author interprets Lakoff s ideas about the spatial metaphor of the "container" as the question of the habitus of space. The question of the limitation of the experience that has set a certain image of spatiality is discussed. In conclusion, the author speaks on some possibilities of a different habitus of space and argues that, in the sphere of conceptual PC games, we have opportunities for expanding the human cognitive arsenal and for a new form of mobility of cognitive resources.

DT Article
DE community; organization; postindustrialism; communityship; value added
   community
AB The article provides a sociophilosophical analysis of the development of a modern organization as a community. The aim of the article is to identify the prospects for the development of the community as a form of social life in the era of post-industrialism. Research methods used in the study were: theoretical analysis of approaches to the study of the formation of local communities and network social entities; historical and philosophical analysis of the ideas of the formation of social communities; method of social and philosophical forecasting. The materials for the analysis were the theories and approaches in the new social philosophy and neoclassical theory of organizations. The study of organizations in the new social philosophy is based on their consideration as an assembly. Assembly means the interpenetration of communities as actors (M. Delanda and P. Bourdieu). Local and network communities are created at the intersection of economic, political, cultural networks (J. Deleuze). The idea of transforming organizations into communities is most vividly represented in the neoclassical theory of organizations (A.P. Sloan, M. Hammer, P.F. Drucker, and others). G. Mintzberg uses the concept of "community feeling"; the term is an analogue of collective will, solidarity, which strengthen social relations. B. Manvil predicts growth in the productivity of organizations developing as network communities. In the new millennium, the conceptual apparatus of social sciences is being updated in the field of the study of communities as forms of social life. Newly introduced concepts (strategy of "community impact", "value added communities", community-ship) have a pronounced "resource" approach, that is, they reflect both the economic and social effects of the development of organizations as communities. The separation of these processes into stages is important for a social and philosophical understanding of the problems of the evolution of organizations into communities. This allows viewing the degree of approximation of a post-industrial society to a self-organized community (F. Laloux, K. Fuhs). In Laloux, a similar evolution is expressed through the creation of a color scale: the movement from orange to green and further to turquoise symbolizes progress in the transformation of organizations into communities. Based on the analysis carried out, the author concluded that the value component dominates in building local communities, in transforming organizations. Communities based on common spiritual values are the most promising way for new forms of social life to function. Such communities can serve as a micromodel of future societies based on trust and solidarity. Reducing the distance between organizations as rigid structures, on the one hand, and communities as flexible social practices, on the other, in the period of postindustrialism is inevitable. This is due to the increasing nonlinearity of social processes and social uncertainty that require synergy and solidarity of community members. In general, these processes will contribute to the strengthening of civil society, the main condition and prerequisite of which is the development of community structures.

AB The article is devoted to the study of patterns of social mobility in the officer corps of the Russian Imperial Army on the eve of the First World War. The Military Statistical Yearbook of the Army for 1912 served as a source of empirical data. The author introduces an indicator of social mobility in order to analyze the career rates of officers. This indicator shows that the speed of the upward social mobility of officers in different types of troops and military districts of the Russian Empire was noticeably variable. To explain this phenomenon, an analysis of education, estate characteristic and nationality is carried out as a determinant of officers' careers. The author introduces indicators of estate, educational and national determination of the officers' social mobility. Education and estate characteristics had a significant impact on the career of an officer. In different types of troops and military districts, this manifested to varying degrees. Most of all, education received at military academies contributed to the careers of officers, on the one hand, and a noble origin, on the other. At the same time, education was already becoming a more significant factor in the upward mobility of officers than the estate characteristic. However, the estate characteristic not only determined the career of an officer, but also influenced the individual's entry into the officer corps to an even greater degree. As a result of this, noblemen dominated in the officer corps of the Russian Empire. Nationality determined the pace of officers' careers and their horizontal mobility (placement in military districts) in a number of cases. In general, in the army, officers of German and Tatar nationalities had the best chances for a quick career, the Russian ethnicity of officers did not have a noticeable influence on their careers, while the careers of officers of Polish, Latvian and Caucasian nationalities were slowed down. However, individuals of German and Russian nationalities had the greatest chances of joining the ranks of officers while for representatives of other nationalities becoming an officer was more difficult or even impossible. The careers of officers in some military districts were influenced by military achievements related to participation in the Russo-Japanese war. The officer corps of the Russian Imperial Army corresponded to the principles of Max Weber's rational bureaucracy only in part, which determined many aspects of Russia's participation in the First World War and also affected the events of the February and October revolutions.

Data comes from theoretical literature, such as theory of managed space and the methodology of intersubjective institutionalism. The authors demonstrate modern changes in the analysis manageability from subject-object manageability in cybernetics and subject-subject manageability in the theory of political decision making to new version of subject-object manageability in closed virtual communities. The authors made conclusion that these changes led to an increase in the role of discourse as a means of establishing and maintaining manageability.

DE social philosophy; educational migration; methodological analysis
AB The article deals with the main aspects of the methodological analysis of the educational migration phenomenon in the social philosophy. The main components of the phenomenon, the key aspects of the ontological conceptual apparatus and the history of educational migration studies in the domestic thought are revealed. Educational migration is a rather specific research field. Nowadays, there is no special definition of the phenomenon in social philosophy. On the one hand, educational migration is directly correlated with the need of a sociocultural adaptation in a foreign educational environment, of the rethinking of individual and social being in the context of a new social experience, as well as with the need to act and express one's own aspirations in another language, in fact, to create another personality or form new specific social communities, such as various versions of national communities, ghettos, enclaves, or Chinatowns. On the other hand, a person is a social creature; therefore, his/her individual ideas about an educational reality can be in a cognitive, social and psychological dissonance with the existing state of affairs. According to the general socio-philosophical paradigm of educational migration, all actions in this area are characterized by the concept of "cross-border (transnational) education" adopted in society. A philosophical analysis of educational migration needs to take into account several key points that can more clearly define its epistemological aspect. Among them are the objective-subjective nature of the main phenomenon, the motives and forms of migration, its historical terms, as well as the philosophical view of the researcher. For a deeper understanding of the nature of educational migration and especially its intensification, it is also necessary to explain the general prerequisites of migration processes, which can be divided into two types: ontological and epistemological. There are several basic theoretical approaches to the study of migration processes, e.g., the culturological concept, the theory of assimilation, the ethno-sociological theory, the theory of social change and the institutional approach. Due to its functions, educational migration allows popularizing national science for the world community, expanding intercultural cooperation between educational environments of different countries, as well as providing a migrant with a socio-cultural complex of conditions for the harmonious development of a personality. From the conceptual point of view, the concept of cross-border education allows setting the ontological, epistemological and culturological aspects of human existence into a single system.

AB This article examines and analyzes the systems and foreign policy activities of the Russian Federation, the United States of America and the People's Republic of China in relation to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) in order to highlight the main characteristics of the future adaptive model of the implementation of Russian foreign policy in the above mentioned country. The objectives of the article are to conduct a comparative analysis of the approaches to the implementation of the foreign policy of the United States, the People's Republic of China, and the Russian Federation in the region using the SRV as an example and to prove the effectiveness of the adaptive approach when using a modeling technique in the implementation of Russia's foreign policy in the Indochina region. The expediency of using the adaptive modeling in foreign policy is determined by the need to plan the activities and directions for the implementation of the national interests of Russia in the region concerned to predict expected results, to pragmatically evaluate available political, economic, informational, military, technical and personnel resources. A comprehensive approach to the studies of contemporary foreign policy processes in the Indochina region and in the SRV, as well as a comparative analysis of the policy models of the USA, the People's Republic of China and Russia in relation to Vietnam have provided a methodological basis for the article. In order to study the receptivity of Vietnamese society to the policies of the mentioned countries, we conducted social research in the northern, central and southern parts of the SRV. E.V. Kobelev, G.M. Lokshin, V.M. Mazyrin, V.N. Kolotov, and P.Y. Tsvetov are studying the problems of international contacts between the SRV and Russia, between the SRV and China, as well as relations between the SRV and the United States. Their research covers the information about politics, history, science, economics, as well as up-to-date data on the situation in the country and Vietnamese foreign affairs, which confirms the relevance of the present research and the need to identify common approaches to the implementation of Russian foreign policy in Vietnam and in the region in general. The author comes to the conclusion that the method of adaptive modeling can be taken as a basis for developing new approaches to promote their national interests in Vietnam. According to the comparative analysis, Russia has a definite advantage over the United States and China in influencing Vietnam's political sphere. However, Russia has fallen behind these two countries in using economic, information and communication resources. In this regard, Russia should pay more attention to the strengthening and further development of political and military ties and also focus on solving the problems of the economic integration of our countries, creating information channels aimed at expanding the dialogue between Russian and Vietnamese cultures.

DE work philosophy; post-Fordism; Aleksei Gastev; freelancers; early Soviet
   school of management
AB The reason for writing the article is watching the movie Videocracy, in which the Italian guy Ricardo wants to work in a TV show and despises his work at the factory. Moreover, in the film, it is the work at the plant that is shown as suitable and meaningful, as opposed to the television show conveyor. The author of the article aims to clarify why alienated labor in a factory seemed to be better than creative work on television. Modern creative work is not such a pleasant activity as the hero of the film dreams of. As an example, the article presents the work of freelancers - modern workers, deprived of any social guarantees and not insured against non-payment. The question is posed of how intellectual work, which has always been thought of as unalienated, creative and conducive to development, turned into a new version of total exploitation. For a possible answer to this difficult question, the author appeals to the early Soviet school of management, especially to Aleksei Gastev and his works on the organization of labor. It is believed that, unlike Taylor and Ford, it was the Soviet school that humanized the work, that is, made it a fundamental project in human life. And indeed it is. Labor in the context of Gastev's works is supposed to be an initiative and conscious process that allows labor operations to be carried out consciously rather than mechanically. The article examines in detail the concept of "labor culture", the creation of which Gastev pays special attention to. In addition, the main points are highlighted on which the anthropologization of labor activity within the Soviet school of management is based: body culture and body discipline, attention to labor tools, time management. However, what should have relieved the worker's fate will eventually turn into a new burden: for example, capitalism adapts to use self-criticism to its advantage, and now the employee needs not only the ability to work mechanically, machine-like, but to work like a human being, it means to use all his/her competencies at work. Thereby, all the time becomes working time, because the worker thinks about work even during non-working hours. Gastev turns out to be a very modern author because in part he was the one who invented this modernity. In the article, besides the texts of Gastev, the texts of Paulo Vimo, Yoel Regev, Bruno Latour and Reza Negarestani are used. Labor as the last essential project can be overcome, since not only labor makes a person human. Labor at the plant, which seems to be humane, is only a form of nostalgia for the time when work was not total; therefore, there is no way back. The conclusion is made about further research, for example, on the texts of Negarestani, especially in connection with his Inhumanism project as a constant revision of anthropological grounds.

TI A Sociocultural Paradigm: Basic Interpretations
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

DE sociocultural dynamics; sociocultural approach; sociocultural paradigm;
   P.A. Sorokin; C. Levi-Strauss
AB The authors deal with the unsolved problem of explicating the sociocultural paradigm widely used in social and humanitarian studies in the form of various implementations of the sociocultural approach. The authors summarize the existing descriptions of the content of the sociocultural approach and identify two basic interpretations of a sociocultural paradigm. The founder of the first interpretation is P.A. Sorokin. The approach focuses on the description of various factors (economic, social, political, spiritual) that determine the sociocultural dynamics of separate, individual objects, which is why it is perceived as a non-novelty variation of externalism. The most authoritative representatives of this interpretation of the sociocultural paradigm in post-Soviet social studies are A.S. Akhiezer and N.I. Lapin. This interpretation of the sociocultural approach draws on the axiological (information-semiotic) concept of culture. The authors see the origins of the second basic interpretation of the sociocultural paradigm in the intellectual heritage of C. Levi-Strauss. He solves the problem of correlation between society and culture, the social and the cultural in a different way. In his opinion, human society is a set of separate local cultures interacting with each other. In this case, culture is understood as a specific variant of social development. Interaction of cultures necessarily leads to cultural exchange and interpenetration, reflection of cultures. Therefore, each individual culture (or social organism) is an ensemble of cultures. In this ensemble, one of the cultures is the leading one, sublates the counterculture as an internal moment and determines the cultural specificity of an individual social organism. Thus, the development of society, from this point of view, is a product of interaction, reflection of cultures. Levi-Strauss formulates, in particular, the following law: any cultural progress is a function of the coalition of cultures. Thanks to this coalition, the chances that occur in each culture in its historical development become a common heritage. The more diverse cultures make up the coalition, the more fertile it is. Consideration of the existence and development of individual societies and the whole of humanity in the process of reflection of cultures gives the authors the basis to designate this interpretation of the sociocultural approach as reflective. In this interpretation, society is represented as an ensemble of cultures, and the sociocultural as the social in its cultural diversity. This image of society is paradigmatic and corresponds to the nonlinear models of social development widely represented in the philosophy of history.

AB This article focuses on long-term housing policy in Russia (1917 onwards). In view of the fact that during the Soviet era housing policy was set by the head of state, the article will discuss the following four periods: pre-industrialization, from industrialization to the Stalin era, from the Khrushchev era to developed Socialism, and post-Soviet collapse. The historical analysis of Soviet housing policy begins with the pre-industrialization period when significant political decisions were taken. A systematic and chronological description of normative legal documents then introduces the reader to the topic and gives a basic knowledge of the physical and social structure of the society. In the next part of this article, the main tendencies in housing policy up until the beginning of the 1950s are then described. Both the pre-industrial period and the period into the 1950s constitute the characteristics of a housing policy that was sustained until the end of the Soviet period.

AB This article examines the changing patterns of industrial conflict in a rapidly modernizing Eastern European city, focusing on a multi-ethnic industrial hub. I follow repertoires of contention in four crucial moments characterized by shifting scales of the geopolitical embeddedness of the city: (1) an early Luddite riot of 1861 in the Polish autonomous sub-state within the Russian Empire, (2) the first massive labor protest and the following pogrom of 1892 in the city already fully subsumed under the imperial governance, (3) a failed revolution of 1905 with a sophisticated feedback loop between party politics and street emotions, (4) mobilization practices during the German military occupation during the IWW culminating in the tram workers strike of 1917, (5) developing forms of industrial bargaining in the early Polish state after 1918. This broad picture spanning over 60 years (1861-1921) is grounded in the existing secondary literature, extensive queries of primary sources such as administration reports, court proceedings and petitions, and the analysis of political leaflets and biographical testimonies of the working class militants. Such a cross temporal comparison brings a broader outlook on the labor unrest in Russian Poland and beyond, which before was researched only in a fragmented manner.

AB This paper is a preliminary publication of the large coin hoard found near the village of Gai-Kodzor, Anapa District of the Krasnodar Krai, in 1986. The Anapa Archaeological Museum acquired 1061 staters of four Bosporan rulers: 3 of Teiranes, 354 of Thothorses, 46 of Radamsades, and 658 of Rheskouporis VI. The latest coin in the hoard dates to the year 638 of the Bosporan era (AD 341/342), providing a terminus post quem for its concealment. The Gai-Kodzor 1986 hoard joins the group of seven similar hoards concealed in AD 341/342. These hoards are connected with the military activity in the region. Mass concealment and cessation of the Bosporan coinage can be explained by the Sarmatian and Alanian invasions of the Bosporan Kingdom in that year. The distribution of hoards deposited in AD 341/342 shows that the barbarians attacked Pantikapaion, Tyritake, Kepoi, and a huge settlement located on the southern Bosporan frontier, near the village of Gai-Kodzor, in the valley of the Shumrinka River. Three similar hoards were found there in 1972, 1977 and 1986. The Third Gai-Kodzor hoard is different from all other synchronous assemblages due to the largest number of coins and the widest range of content. It is of decisive importance for the solution to many disputed issues concerning the dating of some coins and of the reigns of the last Bosporan kings. This assemblage is certainly of great interest for studying the currency, economic and political situation in the Bosporan Kingdom in the second quarter of the fourth century AD.

AB The U.S. withdrawal from INF Treaty will cause significant damage to global arms control system. Besides negative effects on nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation in the world, there will be significant risks of exacerbating the military confrontation in Europe due to potential deployment of medium-and short-range strike capabilities, which were previously prohibited by the INF treaty. The new factors create additional complications compared with the 1980s: the NATO enlargement to the east and the development of fundamentally new weapons, especially hypersonic boost-glide systems. A new "Eurostrategic crisis," once having arisen, may become more severe. At the same time, despite the collapse of the key arms control regime, the parties retain the potential to reach stabilizing compromises in Europe which will allow to avoid a significant military and political confrontation. The importance of possible destabilization defines the motivation to reach these compromises. Successful conclusion and execution of informal or legally nonbinding agreements on refusal or limiting the deployment of the most dangerous medium- and short-range strike capabilities in Europe would open the way to their codification into a new full-scale treaty and would serve to strengthen confidence in the Euro-Atlantic region.

TI United States Democratic Party and the 2020 Presidential Election: The
   Main Candidates, Topics and Features of the Election Rhetoric
SO REGIONOLOGIYA-REGIONOLOGY RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF REGIONAL STUDIES

DT Article
DE United States of America; Democratic Party; 2020 presidential election;
   Democrats; Presiden of the United States of America
AB Introduction. The article is of relevance due to the beginning of the active phase of the race for the right to become the Democratic Party's nominee for the 2020 United States presidential election. The range of issues, topics and features of the election rhetoric of the Democrats will largely determine the outcome of the 2020 election and therefore will influence the subsequent development of the United States. The objective of the study is to analyze the political rhetoric of the major Democratic Party presidential candidates and the political trends among the ranks of the Democrats, taking place against the backdrop of the election campaign.
   Materials and Methods . The study was based on the methods of empirical analysis, such as description, synthesis, analogy, classification, and comparison, which made it possible to consider the main characteristics and topics of the political rhetoric of members of the United States Democratic Party. Publications in the media, recordings of public speeches of the Democratic Party members, statistics, sociological polls, and research by Russian and foreign scientists were used as the materials for the study.
   Results. The author has identified the main topics and features of the election rhetoric of the Democratic Party presidential candidates. Issues of public health, education, and ecology have become central topics for the potential Democratic presidential candidates, which is largely due to a significant shift to the left and the role of the left-wing, Democrats in the electoral process. The study has revealed a significant degree of political disintegration in the Democratic Party. The major challenge the Democrats are faced with today is to nominate a candidate who will be able to fight back the energetic rhetoric of Donald Trump, retain the traditional electorate of the Democratic Party, and attract new supporters.
   Discussion and Conclusion. The research results provide an insight into the processes taking place in the Democratic Party at the stage of nominating the Democratic presidential candidate. The data presented in the article will be useful to researchers interested in the history and politics of the United States. The study conducted makes it possible to better understand the current trends in American domestic policies, which largely determine the state of affairs in international relations.

AB The present article is focused on the search for new approaches in teaching rhetoric and public speaking skills in the system of Russian higher education. The relevance of this topic relates to the lack of rhetorical competences of modern Russian youth. Despite the presence of some authoritative rhetorical schools in modern Russian science and a deep theoretical and applied base, the existing textbooks and manuals on rhetoric and public speaking are largely outdated. It is necessary to introduce some other teaching methods, focused more on practice. Public speaking skills are underestimated in the informational and communicative space of Russian society as well as in the Russian education system. At the same time, there is a need for some appropriate rhetorical tools forming a future specialist of any profession today. They are to be used, taking into consideration all the realities of modern mass communication. The present article gives a comparative analysis of rhetoric in Russia and America. Significant differences in approaches to rhetorical education exist due to cultural, historical and political roots in these countries from one side and to the specific mentality of the Russian and American nations from another side as well. The results of this work include a list of internal and external causes of unsatisfactory quality of rhetorical education in modern Russia and suggestions for improving the situation. Public speaking skills analysis presented in this paper could be extremely useful to all specialists engaged in teaching rhetoric and mass communication in different countries of the world.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE think tanks; ideas industry; fake news; media; digital revolution;
   international relations; public diplomacy; social media; political
   science; digital technologies
AB The article deals with the key challenges of Russian and Western think tanks in the era of digital technologies. It presents a detailed and comprehensive classification of analytical centers and shows how they have been developing historically and politically since the 20th century. The author pays attention to the problem of independence of academic and political expertise in the times of information wars, digital illiteracy and dissemination of fake news. In addition, the author compares Russian and Western think tanks, reveals their main differences, systematizes their problems and proposes several original ways of resolving these challenges facing the academic community both in Russia and the U.S. today. The article's relevance is explained with the fact that today nobody, even experts and academics, are immune to fake news and "disruptive technologies", with their ideas and expertise frequently taken out of context and used in the goal of manipulation, as exemplified by the case of The Brookings Institution and The Atlantic Council in February 2017. Moreover, the lack of demand of academic expertise in political circles during Donald Trump's presidency, the plight of Russia Studies programs and International Relations schools in the U.S. as well as partisanship within think tanks only aggravate the problem of today's ideas industry. But all this makes this article more timely and relevant. Its novelty adds up to the fact that the author uses the systemic and comprehensive approach to resolve the problems of Russian and American think tanks in the era of fake news and digital technologies. In particular, it is offered to focus on the roots of the problems (not their implications) by diversifying and streamlining the sources of think tanks funding, turning "disruptive technologies" into new opportunities and creative tools to restore credibility of political and academic expertise, make it better, more effective, educative, objective and independent.

It is determined that the main problem of the sustainable development of the Russian regions is the lack of practical actions and the absence of a multivariate scenario of the development of the territory. It is concluded that the current stage of modernization of the Russian economy, aimed at creating an economic, political, social and other internationally competitive sense of the country, is not possible without guaranteeing the growth of the welfare of its population, being necessary to restore growth economic for access to sustainable development with strategic planning.

AB This article explores the state and dynamics of scientific collaboration between Russia and the states of the former Soviet Union except for the Baltic countries, by studying the publication activity of researchers with regard to their joint scientific articles indexed in the Web of Science. Statistical data on the number of bilateral joint publications by authors from the Russian Federation and the above-mentioned FSU countries for 2000-2017 were analyzed, as was the distribution of these publications by years, research areas, and main sponsors and organizations with which the authors were affiliated. Four groups of countries were identified demonstrating the dynamics of the development of research and publication collaboration with Russia that can be defined as actively growing, positive, stagnating, or collapsing. The key research areas of Russia's scientific collaboration with the post-Soviet states as a whole and with each of them separately were established as were the organizations with which most authors of joint articles are affiliated, the main areas of collaborative research, and their principal sources of funding. Using the indicators of scientific citation, we assess the comparative demand of the scientific community for joint publications broken into partner countries and key research areas. The significant role of universities in maintaining scientific collaboration in unfavorable political and economic conditions was shown.

AB Introduction. In conditions when the leadership of modern Russia is trying to carry out social and economic reforms, is trying to modernize its industry, financial system, successful experience of industrial reform in difficult socio-economic conditions should and must be in demand. An example of a successful solution to all problems facing the country can be an experience of not only rapid and effective restoration of the national economy which was destroyed during the Second World War, but also the example of the creation of new sectors of the national economy, in particular the automotive industry, in the post-war period (1946-1955).
   The heritage of economic history should be a successful experience of construction of the Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant and related production facilities (combined heat and plant for the production of compact engines). For modern historical science, not only in Russia, but also in other countries, it is interesting: in conditions of post-war devastation, an acute shortage of engineering and technical personnel, a shortage of building materials and limited financial resources in the late 1940s and early 1950s dates to launch modern automotive production - Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant and related enterprises.
   Object. In the presented material with the example of the construction of the largest automobile plant in the industry reveals experience of organizational work to create a completely new production. Examples of resolving management issues and problems, operational leadership methods are given, and the process of making non-standard socio-economic decisions to mobilize limited human, material and financial resources is analyzed to ultimately not only complete complex organizational and technical tasks in the shortest possible time, but put the enterprises into operation, but also to provide in a timely manner the release of trucks and other products, which the country needed so much after the war.
   Purpose of study. The purpose of the study and subsequent analysis was to clarify the factors and conditions that contributed to and hindered the construction of the automobile plant in a particular region. The experience of organizational and political work on mobilizing the workforce for labor achievements and feats in the most difficult socio-economic situation of the majority of workers, examples of solving personnel problems, and working with suppliers in the integration chain was subjected to serious study and analysis. As well as ways to solve complex technical problems.
   Materials and methods of study. The study is based primarily on archival materials, previously unknown to modern science, scientific literature and publications covering this problem, all sorts of statistical sources. The authors widely relied on the materials of the reports of the directorate 's enterprises, party committees of plants, eyewitness's accounts. The materials of the periodical press were widely used. In the course of studying these and other materials, the information reflected in them was systematized and analyzed. A systematic approach, comparative and statistical analysis, as well as a logical generalization of the data and comparative analysis were widely used.
   Study result. I In the course of the study, factors were identified and systematized, both contributing to and hindering the construction of the automobile plant, the goals and objectives set for the enterprise team and other related industries were disclosed, and examples of solving complex organizational and technical problems were given. In addition, new facts related to the history of the industry of a country and a specific region were identified and presented, the production indicators of the plant were analyzed in full during the period of construction and its launch into design figures.
   Discussion and conclusion. The results indicate that the experience gained in the construction of the largest enterprise in the most difficult socio-economic conditions of the post-war devastation should and must be claimed in modern conditions.

TI EURIPIDES' HECUBA: AN ESSAY OF INTERPRETATION
SO VESTNIK DREVNEI ISTORII-JOURNAL OF ANCIENT HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Euripides; tragedy; Hecuba; Athens; Thrace
AB In this article a new interpretation of Euripides' tragedy Hecuba is proposed. As the thematic analysis of the tragedy shows, the author's intention was to stress the relativity of ordinary notions of friendship and enmity and to suggest a new criterion to define them, i.e. virtue and baseness. This theme reflects a political aim of Hecuba: the tragedy was intended to put in doubt the necessity and usefulness of the military alliance with the Thracians. The attitude towards the Thracians should depend not on formal relations of friendship but on moral evaluation of their deeds: their cruelty necessitates the view of them as enemies rather than friends.

   ideology; "cultural Marxism "; media space; discrimination; minorities;
   freedom of speech; doubletalk
AB The article deals with issues related to the evident crisis of the ideology of political correctness in reference to the media landscape of Western countries (including the mass media, public sphere and Internet). The author addresses the roots of the phenomenon, the history of its genesis in the Western world, analyzes its specifics and flaws in terms of the modern it Information society. The use of the politically correct language is discussed in connection with its sociopolitical impact. Special emphasis is placed on ambiguity and inconsistency of the phenomenon, which inevitably raise social and political controversy. On the one hand, there is a vivid contradiction between the freedom of speech as a key democratic principle and the requirements of political correctness that strictly limit this kind of freedom. On the other hand, the initially well-meaning practice against any kind of discrimination (as the political correctness was meant to be) easily turns into a doubletalk and manipulation technology (which is widely used in media and politics today). Such duality underlies the crisis of the ideology of political correctness coming into sharp focus exactly in the media field. This situation is potentially dangerous, is fraught with radicalization of society and eradication of democratic values. Despite the prevalence of political correctness in Western countries, there is also the inner ideological and political opposition to it (mostly represented by the right and far-right forces). The author comes to a conclusion there are only two possible ways out of this situation: either the ideology of political correctness outlives and transforms into something new, or the freedom of speech principle is wholly discredited hence ruining the core of democracy and giving way to a permanent controversy between politically charged media and independent public Internet as citizens' tribune (which is customary for more authoritarian societies in the information era).

TI The Hunnic Version in the Chuvash History (Ethnographic Notes)
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Huns; Savirs; Chuvashes; ethnography; II-V centuries; Caucasus
AB The aim of the article is the analysis of the version of the Hun origin of the Chuvash nation. The author has set an objective to investigate the main primary sources (Ammianus Marcellinus, Yeghishe, Marcellinus Comes, Priscus of Panium, Jordanes, Cedrenus Georgius, Theophylact Simocatta, Procopius Caesariensis, Moses of Khoren, Ghewond) and publications on the subject. The problem range was the discussions of the Hun component in traditional ethnographic blocks of the Savirs and the Chuvash. There are too many unclear points in the history of the origin and development of the Chuvash nation. The truth which the reader wants to know is still locked behind seven seals. The excessive desire of the readers to know, on the one hand, and the great intent of the authors to deliver their considerations to the reader as quickly as possible, on the other hand, have generated compilation, mess and fiction. Most of papers on the ethnogenesis of the Chuvash as of today have been prepared at a level not higher than amateur regional ethnography. One of the reasons for such failures is the absence of direct sources of knowledge about the historical ancestors of the Chuvash. History was merciless to the Chuvash and their language. They were completely forgotten and unknown for centuries, kind of in a position of a nation without kith or kin. In similar cases, the historical science always resorts to retrospection and comparative historical methodology. All tribes with the most enigmatic history always had neighbors, communicated with other tribes, and were incorporated in alliances. The author raises a debating question of the Hun leaders brothers Bleda and Attila. He comes to the conclusion that Bleda who had been removed from power was commanding the eastern wing of the Hun confederation which also included "Huns called Savirs". One can also read in the sources that Hun troops carried fortresses by storm, using rams. However, an attentive reader may find that rams were used not by Huns but by Savirs stationed in their troops. The analysis of sources and basic literature proves that the Hun-Savir topic has been written so far on the basis of known patterns and deviates substantially from reality. The researchers have been captured by the existing hypotheses and confused the Huns with the Savirs - the historical ancestors of the Chuvash. This situation may only be resolved by way of a thorough analysis of primary sources. The sum of the provisions set out in the article and published by previous authors makes it possible to establish that the Savirs and the Huns were absolutely different tribes, though the sources confused them, and they occasionally became members of the same military and political confederations.

DT Article
DE East Africa; regional political integration; nationalism; sovereignty;
   federalism; confederalism
ID INTERVENTION; SOVEREIGNTY
AB The article explores the dynamics of regional integration in East Africa started at the beginning of the 20th century and continued in the middle of the century by Britain for its dependent territories including Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika. The text also deals with the idea of the East African Federation and the fate of the East African Community. The EAC emerged in 1967, and collapsed in 1977 because of persistent political differences, disparities, particular economic interests and newly independent states' nationalisms. The Community was revived twenty years ago, in 1999, manifestly facing the same objective problems as its predecessor. The modern EAC incorporates Kenya, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, joined by Rwanda and Burundi in 2007 and South Sudan in 2016. The Community acts under the motto "One People, One Destiny", though represents a unique phenomenon of a diverse competitive space regarding economic, social and political performances. The author analyses the EAC official documents' rhetoric presenting sovereignty as an impediment to unity. Albeit the "pillars" of integration - customs union, common market, monetary union and political federation under which the EAC partner states envisage coming together toloin; a superstate under a single authority, single government - are in progress, a controversy exists concerning short-run prospects of regional cooperation. Sovereignty imperatives and each country's economic strategies made East African leaders in 2017 take decisions inclining rather to confederation than to federation as a form of political design for the eventual interstate union in the near future. Meanwhile, a federation remains a long-term goal of regional elites. The issue is whether East Africa will ever have one constitution and one president, whether the political federation project will be of any success.

DT Article
DE Great Britain; Maritime doctrine; Royal Navy; Brexit; security
AB With the release of the UK from the European Union (EU), changes are taking place in the European and Euro-Atlantic security systems. After Brexit, the traditionally important role of the Royal Navy in defence of the West will become a significant factor in Great Britain's relations with key partners in the field of security and defence policy the EU and NATO members. At the same time, the UK seeks to preserve and multiply its global influence. All these factors naturally lead to the transformation of its maritime strategy in the new international political context. London seeks to keep a modern combat-ready fleet capable of carrying out operations at a great distance from the British Isles. Procurement of high-tech equipment will enhance the capabilities of the armed forces, and in particular the fleet, under modern combat conditions. An important factor in Britain's maritime security is the military cooperation with NATO, the EU and bilateral agreements' allies. However, Brexit seems to cause financial and reputational costs for the armed forces of the UK. Despite the desire to find new partners at the global level, the future of the most important partnership with the EU in the areas of defence and security is not defined. Expenditures for the armament of Great Britain are threatened with reductions. At the same time, expenditures are affected by the implantation of new technologies which require more and more funds. Most likely, this will lead to the detriment of financing procurements of classical defence equipment. The final assessment of Brexit's influence on the UK's maritime strategy will be possible after the end of negotiations between London and Brussels on the future defence and security cooperation resulting in an agreement on the final deal by all parties, including the Parliament of the United Kingdom (or in the case of non-agreement and no-deal Brexit).

AB The methodology and organization of the interaction of the power and the expert community in the context of decreasing the risks of corruptibility in state and political decisions are investigated in this article. The "linearly-autonomous" model and the model of a "virtuous result" characterized by moral and ethical values and the status of the power and experts are analyzed. The factors influencing the specifics of the power and experts' interaction in Russia are revealed. Among them are traditions of the Soviet authoritarianism; a wide discretion of officials in questions of political and administrative decision-making; backwardness of the intellectual property right institution; insufficient demand of expert knowledge in Russian medium-sized business; a low level of the power and experts' interaction culture. It is shown that the cumulative action of these factors leads to a reproduction of the "paid result" model within which experts are attracted for approval of the power's decisions rather than for an independent objective assessment and work for a reward or an increase in the symbolical status. The international experience is investigated, features of "think tanks" genesis in Russia are revealed, and their classification is presented. A need for the development of "institutions of public policy" to improve the system of the power and experts' interaction system is reasoned. "Pro-power" and "demo-cratic" forms of "public policy institutions" depending on the specifics of their genesis and resource opportunities are distinguished. It is shown that in rapidly developing countries "pro-power" public policy institutions will be efficient in the short-term period for such countries have authoritative traditions, and insufficiency of rules and norms of interaction in them is compensated by the top officials' wish to involve the public in process of transformations. This efficiency is reached for the account of the stand-alone nature of the centers' status, the centers' possibility to contact to the first person of the state, the mandate on the organization of the power and experts' interaction and non-departmental control of acceptance and execution of state decisions. At the same time, these factors increase the risk of bureaucratization of the "pro-power" public policy institutions. To avoid this, Russia must develop "public policy institutions" in the aspects of strengthening the civic network of the expert community, improving the forms and technologies of the power and experts' interaction.

DE Russian museum science; division of museum history into periods
AB The paper describes unexplored topic of division of Russian museum history into periods. The authors of the article used the ideas of a prominent Russian historian A.Y. Gurevich. He said that scientific concept of division into periods helps to dismember the historical process and focus on the study of a specific plot. Moreover, different aspects of historical development possess their own division. Using this notion, the authors of article pointed out that the original study of the Russian Museum history was based on universal division. The basis of the criteria of division into periods created formation theory of social development. So Russian investigators studied the history of museums during feudalism, i.e. XVIII -first half of XIX century. A.M. Razgon, D.A. Ravikovich and others studied the history of Russian museums for capitalism, which was dated as 1861-1917. The dismemberment of Russian museum history for socialism had different stages of development. For example, the investigators studied museum history during the Revolution in 1917-1918. They concentrated on a period of the economy recovery in 1920-1925, then they considered the museum history during so-called Stalin's five-year plans (1928-1941), as well as Great Patriotic war, and the post-war Soviet five-year plans, etc. Changes in the socio-political developments in Russia in 1990s entailed an update of division into periods. Moscow museologist A. A. Sundieva developed a cultural model of the dismemberment of Museum development. This model includes the protomuseum period (to the beginning of the XVIII century), the time of the genesis of Museum as a cultural form (XVIII-XIX centuries), the acquisition of status of cultural norm by museums (1890-1920), and the inclusion of museums in the national cultural tradition (1930-1990s). By the same time Omsk museologist N. A. Tomilov had prepared a new model of division into periods. It reflects the specific events of Russian museum history and includes nine separate stages of museum development.
   The authors of the article appreciate all the works. Still they felt, it was necessary to use the principles of history periodization formulated by V.O. Klyuchevskiy. He dismembered historical time into spaces filled with the most influential factors of political, economic, and cultural processes. The application of this principle to the history museum allows us to formulate four large period in its development. First of them was the time of XVI-XVIII centuries, when the Museum grew accustomed to collect and preserve cultural heritage. During the second period, since the beginning of the 19th century and until the end of the 1920s, scientific and public importance of the Museum's activities was established. At the third period, in 1930-1980s, Russian museums were obeyed to Soviet State tasks, all of them have been turned into institutions of socialism propaganda. In the fourth stage, since the beginning of the 1990s, Russian museums have a certain independence; receive the right to follow its own Museum rules and views.

DE working class; working-class youth; life course; life strategies
AB The subject domain of the study is life patterns and strategies of the Russian new working-class youth. Exploring the relationship between the new working-class studies and life course studies, this research combines the consideration of a life course as a structurally organized integrity with a phenomenological perspective on the study of life strategies. The notion of the "new working class" and the criteria for its definition have been proposed and substantiated. Biographical in-depth interviews of 31 young working-class representatives and a mass poll of 1532 respondents were used to focus on the implementation of class normative patterns and to determine their consistency with individual life strategies and with means by which these patterns are constructed and legitimized in the context of the structural strengths and constraints of society with an extremely high degree of social inequalities and the precarity of youth labour. To disclose the dominant normative patterns that structure the life course of the Russian working-class youth as the main research question of this article, the author considered the main life course trajectories (education, family and career) and sought to measure and understand the following aspects: normative temporal limitations and the preferred sequence of the main role transitions (finishing education, full-time job, first career promotion, marriage, having a first child); the correlation between the real and preferable time and sequence of role transitions; the preservation of traditional class distinctions within life course normative patterns or their inversion, differentiation or displacing by other patterns and values during the period of emerging adulthood. The study has shown the remaining significance and value of the traditional life course structures while current social conditions (wages, mortgage rate, the access to higher education and its quality, the interrelation between education and market requirements, etc.) do not allow to fulfil this life strategy any longer. The trendy normative patterns of the middle-class youth (refusal from institutional education, freelance jobs) are used as tools legitimating the existing class barriers, lack of access to education, fundamental lack of trust to major social institutions. Due to these reasons, young workers choose the adaptation and survival life strategies which restrict their professional and cultural potential realization and create a negative social mood.

DE Peter Winch; methodology of social science; theory of social action
AB The article is devoted to the evaluation of the significance of the ideas of Peter Winch and his followers Phil Hutchinson, Rupert Read and Wes Sharrock for the methodology of sociological research. The essence of Winch's argument formulated in The Idea of Social Science and Its Relation to Philosophy is that, within sociology, what is explored consists in rules shared by a particular community rather than in empirical regularities, so the method should be considered as a conceptual analysis. The most radical interpretation of this argument by Hutchinson, Read and Sharrock implies that sociology cannot produce new knowledge at all and should be reduced only to clarifying what is already known to social actors. As it turned out in the course of research on the development of the ideas of Hans Skjervheim and Harold Garfinkel that are similar to Winch's ones, accepting Winch's methodological criticism of "objectifying" sociology does not cancel the fact that interpretive sociology supported by Winch cannot solve the problem he posed. Moreover, as it is shown below, similar problems exist in the natural sciences; therefore, something else is required to prove the impossibility of applying the scientific method in sociology. If one looks at the situation more broadly, it is unclear why the assumption of the usefulness of the scientific method in sociology is more dubious and needs more argumentation than the assumption of its uselessness. In addition, when Winch and his followers discuss sociology as a science they make an error that consists in the fact that the subject for a sociologist's explanation is not action itself but its descriptions, and, therefore, descriptions that do not allow a nomological explanation can be replaced with the ones that allow it. The article presents examples of such a replacement taken from the works of Arthur Danto on the methodology of history that can be easily translated into a sociological context. Thus, it has been demonstrated that an adequate scientific method for a sociological research is generally possible even if it is not possible to justify the adequacy of any of the existing specific methods.

DE philosophy of technology; projective semiosis; problem of the new;
   invention; meaning
AB The article summarizes the results obtained by the team of authors when working on a project on the study of semiotic foundations of technology and technical consciousness presented in the reports of the conferences in 2017-18. The notion of meaning is considered in the context of general semiotics as the fulfillment of the semantic rule of semiosis. Semiosis itself is divided into receptive and projective; receptive semiosis is referred to as "cognition", projective semiosis as "technnology". The subject of analysis is the transition from receptive semiosis to projective one, fixed in the philosophy of technology through the concept of "invention" and entailing the creation of the "new". The authors interpret classical works on the philosophy of technology of Peter K. Engelmeyer and Friedrich Dessauer, the concept of invention of Ivan I. Lapshin. The general methodology is transcendental semiotics as reflected in the works of Alexandr Yu. Nesterov. The reasoning is constructed as follows. In the projective activity, the subject consistently performs (1) the semantic rule of semiosis in intellect [intellectus, Vernunft], (2) the semantic rule of semiosis in reason [ratio, Verstand], (3) the semantic rule of semiosis in sensory perception. At the first step, the "new" arises as a new ratio of the imaginable and unthinkable, the new order of the arrangement of thoughts, new thoughts (new hypotheses, phantasms), a new substratum of reflection; at the second step, it arises as a new expression of the expressible and the ineffable in the language, a new order of the arrangement of signs (sentences and texts in one or another language), a new designation, a new substratum of linguistic expression (for example, programming); at the third step, as a new relationship between the possible and the impossible, new rules of activity (laws of nature), new objects of sensory perception (artifacts), new substrata for objectifying activity (for example, creating artifacts in the microworld). The result of the work is formulated in the form of definitions: "meaning" in the context of the philosophy of technology is the consistent fulfillment of the semantic rule in the semiosis of the intellectual, rational and physical activity of man, "invention" is the transformation of the rule of formation and/or the transformation of signs resulting from a change in the pragmatic rule direction of semiosis and entailing a new meaning.

ID TOURISM
AB Tourism is one of the most important forms of human migration in the modern world. International tourism is also one of the key ways to form a global society. Tourism is an important means of personal development and, at the same time, an important branch of the global economy. There are very different levels of development of the tourist industry in different countries of the world. Tourist superpowers of our age are France, the USA and Spain. In recent years, Russia has failed to reach the top ten leading tourist countries of the world; thus, the task of enhancing its tourist potential is an urgent one. The purpose of tourist routes and tourist hubs are metropolises, and their attractiveness is of great importance in terms of increasing tourist flows. The main components of the structure of the attractiveness of cities are the charm of their hotels, restaurants and sights. Based on empirical data, the author examines the perception of the main components of the tourist infrastructure of 12 megalopolises of Russia by Russian citizens and foreign tourists. The author analyzes Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novo-sibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan, Samara, Omsk, Chelyabinsk, Rostov-on-Don, Ufa and Krasnoyarsk. Based on the methodology proposed in the article, the values of indicators of the attractiveness of hotels, restaurants and sights, as well as the integral indicator of the attractiveness of Russian megalopolises are calculated. In the opinion of Russian citizens, the best hotels in their country are in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kazan, the most attractive restaurants are in Kazan, St. Petersburg and Moscow, and the most interesting sights are in St. Petersburg, Moscow and Kazan. In the perception of Russian citizens, the most attractive metropolises of Russia in a decreasing order are St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, Yekaterinburg and Nizhny Novgorod. There are important differences in the perception of the attractiveness of Russian cities by citizens of Russia and foreign tourists. Foreign guests highly appreciate Moscow and St. Petersburg, but other Russian megalopolises are of much less interest for them. The most prominent sights of Russia in the perception of Russian citizens are Red Square in Moscow, the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood in St. Petersburg and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. International tourists appreciate above all the State Hermitage Museum, the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood and Red Square.

DE intimacy; extimacy; gender; post-family society; love simulacra
AB In the article, a new situation in intimacy that is transforming in modern neoliberal societies is discussed. Developing the idea and terminology of Jacques Lacan, the author suggests referring to this new intimacy as "extimacy". The main characteristics of extimacy as a new type of gender symbolic exchange, fundamentally anti-social and hostile to the social exchange, are described. The aim of the article is to analyse the features of extimacy as a kind of symbolic exchange in post-family neoliberal societies. The methodology used in the article is as follows: (1) a structuralist method of analysis of the historical narrative and communication; (2) a semiotic method of analysis of signs and meanings broadcast by the mass media; (3) a philosophical method of abstraction; (4) a philosophical method of analysis and synthesis; (5) psychoanalytic methods in the traditions of Jacques Lacan and Leopold von Sacher-Masoch; (6) a method of socio-philosophical analysis. It is demonstrated that extimacy as a form of symbolic exchange broadcast by the mass media, is characterised by the following components: (1) codification of nudity as a permanent simulacrum of sexuality; (2) presence of a set of semiotic and cultural practices for the involvement of intimacy in the sphere of the visually accessible space, intentionally ostentatious and purposefully demonstrated; (3) elimination of the true intimacy understood as an isolation of the private sphere from the public dimension; (4) simulation of love; (5) radical transformation of traditional gender-power relations; (6) broad involvement of the entertainment component of the mass media to broadcast stereotypes of the new system of gender statuses (mass cinema, video games, Internet entertainment websites, TV entertainment shows, social networks); (7) emergence of new gender identities associated with the visualisation and public demonstration of intimacy as well as fundamental rejection of any hint of the constancy in love relationships (voyeurs, swingers, intimate temporality representatives, supporters of the "night clubs" culture); (8) transgressive transformation of social interpellation into the interpellation of erotic desire; (9) emphasising of the extreme individualisation of society in which the only law of gender communication is the law of individual desire; (10) creation of a psychological complex of guilt in individuals who do not reproduce the strategy of extimacy, the guilt whose symbolic aspects are well described in Althusser's terms of power and obedience. It is revealed that in the social space postmodern extimacy comes into close contact with consumerism and cultural stimulation of mass consumption in which the real relationships of love begin to be simulated, and the social institutions of family and marriage begin to be refused.

AB The article considers the problem of the conflict of norms in philosophical thinking within the framework of one paradigm. The subject of analysis is the styles of thinking in modern analytic philosophy in the treatment of the thesis of Aristotelian essentialism, a doctrine about necessary and contingent properties for objects. The conflict between the anti-metaphysical treatment of essentialism by Willard Quine and the revival of metaphysics of essentialism by Saul Kripke is investigated. The two approaches are compared within the framework of one paradigm of analytic philosophy on the basis of Quine's objections to quantifier modal logic and the admissibility of this logic in the concept of naming by Kripke. It is shown that Quine adopts normative guidelines within the framework of Russell's thesis "logic is the essence of philosophy", while Kripke's normative guidelines are based on recognizing the importance of pre-theoretical thinking inherent in the intuition of an ordinary person. The development of Kripke's new naming theory results in a revision of a significant number of traditional concepts, among which the justification for a priori necessary assertions stands out. Two ways of assessing the conflict of norms in analytic philosophy are considered. The first, belonging to Jaakko Hintikka, a prominent representative of the analytical trend, rejects the idea of the importance of pretheoretical thinking not explicated by logic. Hintikka believes that the refusal to use the logical apparatus when interpreting philosophical theses speaks of the weakness of the position of Kripke, who is known as the author of important logical ideas. The second, belonging to Richard Rorty, a prominent opponent of the analytical school, is based on the insignificance of addressing universal human intuition for philosophy. Rorty's position is motivated by the total criticism of the paradigm of analytic philosophy, while Hintikka's position is motivated by criticism of the norm of philosophical thinking within the framework of one paradigm. The article concludes that the history of rejection and revival in the analytic philosophy of Aristotelian essentialism is a change in the concept of normativity as a kind of a prescription of what can be done and what cannot be done there. As a consequence, the change of norms with the transition from one paradigm to another is inevitable. A view is suggested that it would be natural to regard the change in norms as a process within the framework of one paradigm, that is, a process within the framework of the normal (according to Thomas Kuhn) period of the development of science.

The paper examines the documents of the European Commission on energy policy as well as the intergovernmental documents, statistical data of exporting countries on gas reserves, production and volumes of supply to the EU. The authors show that the European Union seeks to increase volumes of gas import from the Caspian and Black Sea region. Political interest of the consumer in the gas transportation project leads to its implementation in the conditions of economic and political uncertainty: existence of sufficient reserves of gas only for delivery in short- and midterm perspectives, sanctions policy against a number of producing states. The potential competition between the gas producing countries in the Caspian-Black Sea region is also considered.

AB Two books recently published abroad by prominent historians of biology on Lysenkoism acknowledging the revival of interest in this phenomenon among the international scientific community are considered. The first book in two volumes, The Lysenko Controversy As a Global Phenomenon, edited by W. deJong-Lambert and N.L. Krementsov, combines modernized old and new approaches to the study and understanding of Lysenkoism. The author shows the merits of the two volumes, demonstrating the progress reached in recent years in works on this topic, and focuses on several drawbacks of the edition. The other book analyzed is L. Graham's, Lysenko's Ghost: Epigenetics and Russia. In this book T.D. Lysenko's activities and their consequences for scientific culture in general and for contemporary Russian science in particular as well as some problems of Lysenkoism in the country's current political context are considered. In the opinion of the reviewer, the polemical character of the book gives a serious reason for reflections on the fate of not only Russian science but also of the country.

There is a significant number of works in the literature today that examine each of the chains of this relationship separately (the influence of social position on political preferences, the impact of political preferences on political participation). However, the role of political preference as a mediator of the influence of social position on political participation has not been studied. The current work contributes to the development of this approach by applying a model of mediation effect. The model consists of three variables: dependent (political participation), independent (social position), and mediator variable (political preferences). In order to construct the corresponding regressions and assess significances, the authors constructed a three-dimensional space of political preferences: the first axis is associated with the ideas of the agreement about material inequality, the second axis is the ideas about the importance of a welfare state, and the third axis is the degree of tolerance for migrants. Two types of political participation were considered with respect to the dependent variable: voting and direct participation initiated by citizens rather than by government. The study examined data from the 8th wave of the European Social Survey (2016), and the analysis was carried out on three groups of countries: Western Europe (Belgium, Austria, Germany, France), post-socialist countries of Central Europe (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland), and Russia. The results reveal the statistical significance of political preferences as a mediator of the influence of social position on political participation; meanwhile, the direction of influence was nearly the same for the three groups of countries. The differences between the states were in the (non-)significance of the coefficients themselves. As a whole, it may be concluded that in relation to Western countries, the obtained patterns correspond quite accurately to the present views in the literature; the impact of social position on political participation in post-socialist countries (including Russia) is less significant, as only a few social differences are manifested in the political sphere.

DT Article
DE the post-Soviet Central Asia; China; "One Belt, One Road" Initiative;
   multi-vector policy
AB The growing role of China is one of the most notable trends in the modern development of the post-Soviet Central Asia. As a world power the PRC has established close contacts with many other countries and regions in the framework of its global projects ("The Silk Road Economic Belt", "One Belt, One Road" and more). These projects, which include not only a logistic component, but also infrastructure, industry, trade, services, etc. in the regions where Chinese initiatives are applied, allow Central Asian countries to attract investments that are so necessary for their development and modernization. As far as China is concerned, there are opportunities to expand its economic and political influence in the Central Asian region. A number of multilateral projects and development strategies are linked with "Belt and Road": the pro-Russian "Eurasian Economic Union", the Mongolian "Prairie Road", "Nurly Zhol" of Kazakhstan, "Two Corridors and One Ring" of Vietnam, "Vision 2030" of Saudi Arabia, the Turkish "Middle Corridor Initiative" (which suggests linking China to Europe through Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, the Caspian Sea and Turkey) and other. All this allows the PRC to expand its global and regional positions. This is particularly evident in the regions of South and Southeast Asia. As for the political strategy of China in Central Asia, it is formed by Beijing on the basis of awareness of its national security challenges in the troubled Xinjiang region. Economic and political interests play an important role in positive assessment of the Chinese factor by a significant part of the political elite and representatives of the business community in Central Asian countries, who believe that without attracting foreign investment, using foreign practices and technologies, these states cannot count on qualitative development or improvement of their socioeconomic situation. But if the Central Asian elites consider the PRC primarily as an important economic and political partner, in the public perception, the Chinese factor is often presented as a threat. The development of economic cooperation with Central Asian states can lead to a situation where China, gradually strengthening its presence in this post-Soviet region, builds here a system of its own domination. The "multi-vector" approach also hinders the regional cooperation which is so necessary for the Central Asian countries to become equal partners in different integration projects, including those initiated by such a major global player like China.

AB The choice of methodology in political science is the cornerstone, which makes the success of a research project. The book "Contemporary Political Science: Methodology" published in 2019 provides Russian political scientists with a vision of the current state of art, which is define as a combination of classical and contemporary intellectual political and theoretical paradigms. Based on the consistent description of the general scientific approaches, traditional and innovative methodologies of social sciences, transformed to the analysis of the policy sphere of methodologies, macro-theories and medium-level theories, the authors propose original analysis of the most complex problems in political relationship. Reflection of inadequacy of the orientation on one methodological strategy is combined with a scientific publication with a clear explanation of the potential and advantages of each of them. In some cases, the authors turn to ostensibly outdated methodological approaches and show how they work in solving specific research problems. The problem of the multiparadigm of contemporary researches, an adequacy of the combination of various methodological approaches within the same research project in combination with the correct choice of concepts remain quite acute for Russian political science. Contrary to popular perception concerning dominance of the American school in political science, the publication of the reviewed book demonstrates the contribution of the Russian authors to the development of political science methodology.

DE national policy; cross-border zone; social technologies; ethnic
   processes, separatism; Caucasus; Altai-Sayan ecoregion
AB The determination of methodologies for the identification of the relationship between existing national policies and ethnic processes is the aim of this article. The subject area is outlined by two cross-border zones of Russia (the Caucasus, the Altai-Sayan mountain region) with a characteristic multi-ethnic and multi-confessional composition of the population. The territorial framework is determined by national policy specifics in border areas; the policy is not directly related to the state structure forms and political regimes change. The study has chronological limits: the past two centuries. This period is determined by the orientation of the ethnic processes study. These processes are seen as ethnic and religious minorities' reactions to the national and foreign policies. The author of the article relies on historiographical sources devoted to the history of the Russian national policy and the cross-border zone population's ethnic history. The principles of a systematic approach (as a methodological basis) are attached to the natives' traditional social institutions genesis study. Three plots are considered. The first is devoted to the category of trans-border zones, the principles of their allocation and manifestation forms. The second plot is related to the problem of the border regime definition in areas of intensive intra-and inter-ethnic communications. The third plot is devoted to social technologies aimed at the ethno-social situation stabilization in border areas. Several working hypotheses based on the analysis were formed. The definition of border regimes (state security) is universal. This creates broad opportunities for comparative analysis of neighboring countries' national policies, on the one hand. On the other hand, the conditions for comparing the internal policies of the central and border areas are being formed. The low population density, length of borders, border disputes determined the national policy course specifics in the border areas. The preservation of state sovereignty on the basis of a stable ethno-social situation was a priority task of both foreign and national policy at all stages of Russia's historical development. This trend significantly reduces the possibility of chauvinism of the "titular ethnos" manifestation. The preservation of natives' traditional social institutions (clan organization, family, latent forms of self-government and legal proceedings) was allowed by the state in cases of loyalty of ethnic elites to the ongoing political course. National elites' integration into the social institutions of the state was the central trend of stability of state borders. Technologies for neutralizing conflict situations (military expeditions, deportations of minorities, changes in ethnic composition, etc.) in the border areas of Russia were focused on the internal policy of neighboring states. They were universal in their functions (features).

DE plagiarism; self-plagiarism; conscientiousness - unconscientiousness;
   peer-reviewers; opponents
AB The article analyzes the plagiarism phenomenon from the point of view of Russian and foreign scholars. The authors demonstrate different opinions on this phenomenon related to the comprehension of the nature of science and to various cultural traditions. The opinions range from a rather tolerant attitude towards plagiarism to a radically intolerant one. The complex and ambiguous position of peer reviewers and experts in the system of ethical relations of all subjects of scientific publications is shown. The article focuses on the situational and dynamic traits of scientific ethos. In general, the main idea of the article is the unconditional diffusion of plagiarism with its stable place in the reality and in the perception of the academia members. An attempt has been made to examine the ethical interrelationship of the two most important social institutions - education and science - in the context of the value shift in society. Plagiarism is particularly relevant in the academic milieu. Fighting scientific plagiarism is not a rhetorical question. The scale of plagiarism according to Russian scholars has been revealed through a local sociological survey; its results are presented in the article. A study in a particular university allowed the authors to assess the perception of plagiarism from the standpoint of the "permissible - impermissible" attitude, and to reveal various shades of this attitude. The authors proved the adequacy of the developed research tool (a questionnaire), which is important in view of the delicacy of the topic. The questionnaire was compiled based on the discourse on the distribution of plagiarism in the Russian academic community, taking into account the opinions of leading experts and scholars - sociologists, political scientists, and philosophers. The data obtained allow to draw a conclusion about the undoubted relevance of the problem of scientific plagiarism, the features of which are: abundance, complexity and ambiguity, dependence on the situation and on the most decisive sociocultural factor (pressure on scholars, demand of research results, improvement in the quality of professional growth, deadlines, limited resources). Other important factors are technological (the possibilities of modern technology, copying speed, information technology literacy) and personal psychological (motivation for intellectual theft from a particular researcher due to the absence of moral obligations). The survey clearly showed that plagiarism is perceived primarily as misappropriation of someone else's achievements and violation of non-property rights. Unfortunately, the question of the inadmissibility of scientific plagiarism remains open: only half of the representatives of the academic community who volunteered to participate in the survey claim this. The authors found that the problematic range, based on the opinion of the respondents, was from 30 to 40% of plagiarism in a research work. It is indicative that about half of the respondents consider the activity of Dissernet.org useful. In general, the authors do not consider the ethical side of scientific plagiarism to be clarified and unambiguous. This should be discussed in further publications of the results of a more methodologically thorough research. The authors claim that it is scholars who committed plagiarism that are fully responsible for this violation of scientific ethos that grossly distorts the meaning and goals of scientific activities.

AB The article aims to reveal the alternative idea to the widespread approaches to the interpretation and solution of the teachers' psychosocial problems that consider the impact of contemporary sociocultural trends. The research mainly focuses on the understanding of the deep sources of the school system problems, on the construction of an explanation model for these sources to describe the situation in terms of teachers' psychological and emotional wellbeing, of the impact of negative organizational factors, and of the developed concept of social apathy. The study was conducted by the method of focus group among Tomsk teachers. It revealed the main problems that complicate their work and the meanings teachers put into their activities, as well as ways of interpretation that encourage them to continue to work or to quit. The respondents noted that over the past 10 years the Russian educational system saw some negative trends such as frequent changes in approaches and standards of education, the emergence of the cult of the child's right, the spread of disrespectful attitude to the teaching profession and work in society, the growing informatization and pragmatism of the young, the lack of teachers' community, declarative and bureaucratic nature of activities. The majority of teachers adapt to the problems in the profession through a strategy of abstraction and pragmatization. In this regard, it seems necessary to change the methods of working with teachers, including the formation of identity, to change their discourse from obligation to "self-determination" and "utility, necessity". Apathy arises when a person does not understand their own strategies, motivation; therefore, it is necessary to create a "free" space in schools for teachers. Joint work with teachers on the understanding of the social situation, universal problems, their inclusion into the social context must create the reflective field for a conscious choice and help use internal resources in this significant profession.

DE national-state identity; crisis of identity; "Slavic world"; image of
   "ours"
AB The article is devoted to the role of the image of the "Slavic world" in the formation of the Russian national-state identity, which is characterized as an integrated image of "us", "ours" crystallized in mass consciousness (including the axiological, temporal, symbolic dimensions). This image is a complex politico-psychological and socio-cultural construct, dynamics of which is due to both the transformation of the political system of modern Russia and a wide complex of factors related to Russian history and culture. Initially, the authors pay attention to the construction of the idea of the "Slavic world" in the 19th century, which was built on the imperative of the "unity of the Slavic peoples". At the same time, the then image of the "Slavic world" can be considered as an emotional construct very weakly associated with geopolitical realities. The second part of the article is devoted to the revival of the problems of the "Slavic world" in the 1990s - early 2000s, which was associated with the collapse of the USSR and the crisis of the national-state identity in the "new Russia", the destruction of the fundamental values of society, images of the past and the future. It was then that the Russian political elites periodically appealed to the idea of "Slavic unity" for tactic goals (for example, attempts to create a "union state" with Belarus at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s). Analyzing the contemporary place of the "Slavic world" in Russian political discourse, the authors note that the events of 2013-2018 ("Euromaidan", conflict in the Donbas, crisis in relations with Belarus) outlined its peripheral nature. They also demonstrate the extreme amorphousness and cognitive poverty of the "image of the Slavic world" in the political consciousness of Russian citizens. Discussing the perspectives for the actualization of the concept of the "Slavic world" in Russian political discourse, the authors note that in Russia interest in "Slavic unity" increases in the conditions of the crisis of the national-state identity. However, the historical experience of the past century and a half shows that the integration potential of the image of the "Slavic world" is not enough to act as a "restructuring point" for the Russian national-state identity.

AB The article deals with some aspects of Homeric question, focusing mainly on the practice of Homeric recitations at the Panathenaea festival. Following the 'evolutionary model' suggested by Gregory Nagy who stresses the importance of the festival for maintaining the authority of the Iliad and the Odyssey, the author addresses the particular problem: why these two poems were finally acknowledged as the only and truly 'Homeric'. He argues that it was partly due to some political and ideological reasons. In the Panathenaean framework these two poems got specifically linked to Athens, because of the prominent role the city's patron goddess was playing in them. This hypothesis is supported by iconographic evidence: by the end of the sixth century BC Athena becomes a stock character in Athenian vase painting in the scenes related to Trojan war. The political significance of Homeric poems is also maintained by legendary stories em-phasizing the crucial role of Athens in the process of establishing the "true Homer" (Peisistratean Recension), and the importance of Homeric texts in solving political conflicts.

DE North Africa; Islamic values and institutions; modernization; "green
   economy"
AB The commentaries of participants of the seminar on M. Volodina's paper "Modernization in North Africa" are summarized in the article. The authors analyze modernization problems of the North African region in different dimensions. First dimension is a civilizational one. The North Africa belongs to the center of the Islamic civilization. That is why the question is important to what extent the Islamic values and institutions can be integrated into the process of modernization. Up to the present, Islamic organizations in the region have been rather opponents of a secular power than its allies (except, probably, the Turkish case). This can be seen in the region. The process of modernization in these countries (Tunisia, Egypt and other) could not resolve difficult economic and social problems. As a result, the protest movement of the so-called "Arab Spring" appeared. The Islamic political forces made attempts to take power, but every time failed. However, the secular political leaders, mainly authoritarian, also were not successful in their e f forts to change the situation and to promote economic and social modernization as well as political one. Besides, the danger of the Islamic terrorism - internal or international - remains a difficult problem for almost all states of the region. At last, nowadays, the catch-up modernization in developing countries includes an ecological aspect as a factor of balanced progress. Therefore, an adequate ecological policy and "green economy" are necessary for this region because of its climate and resource characteristics. The first steps in this direction are already taken, mainly in Morocco, and this case may set the pattern for others.

DE Robert Nozick; neuroeconomics; state; security
AB A minimal state, whose primary function is to protect an individual, is considered the only acceptable type of state for many supporters of liberal concepts. Currently, the concepts "protection of an individual" and "security of an individual" are changing. The article demonstrates the transformation of the protective functions of a minimal state due to changes in the concept "security of an individual". In Robert Nozick's theory, the principle of reparation governs the relationship between individuals and the imposition of prohibitions. An individual's personality, as well as the idea that all people have the right to do what they want with their lives and personalities, occupies an important place in Nozick's theory. Society and the state should respect the personal choice of an individual. The article does not address discussions about free will and determinism, but addresses the question of how the state can ensure the most independent choice of behaviour by individuals. The problem is that nowadays people are objects of influence of mass culture, and risk making decisions differently than they would like before they became objects of influence. The media dictate stereotypes, and people change their behavior. Protecting individuals from the media would enable them to make decisions more independently of the behavioural patterns dictated. The article demonstrates that the principle of reparation can protect individuals. Due to this protection from the media, the functions of a minimal state are expanded and now the term "security" includes "security from the media". The second problem is how to ensure the independence of the choice of behaviour by individuals in the context of research results of neuroeconomics, neurobiology, etc. Deficiency of hormones or neurotransmitters and alimentary dystrophy violate the usual process of the choice of behaviour, and influence the attitude towards injustice. Changes in the biochemical balance determine an individual's behaviour and choice. The second stage of the empowerment of a minimal state and of the term "security" is provding "security from internal threats". Because of actions to ensure the security of individuals from these threats, a liberal minimal state conflicts with the principles of liberalism and with Nozick's theory.

AB This article deals with the poem Medea by the Latin poet Dracontius, who lived in the Vandal Africa in the end of the fifth - beginning of the sixth century. Analysis of the terms and characters of this poem in the context of Dracontius's works in general implies that in this case, as well as in other texts by the Carthaginian poet, the mythological plot became an allegory of the events contemporary to the author and relating to the Romano-Vandal conflict. This political interpretation, in its turn, helps to give a new explanation of the differences between versions of the myth given by Dracontius and by classical authors, Euripides and Seneca.

Hart's theory of an ascriptive legal language as it has been developed in his influential paper "The Ascription of Responsibility and Rights" through the application of a methodology of the speech act theory proposed especially by J.L. Austin and partly by J. Searle. I propose to retrieve Hart's theory of ascriptive statements in the face of critics by carefully analyzing the ascriptions in the context of the speech act theory and capturing their linguistic applications in the legal language, at least for some of them. The result is not the refutation of ascriptivism but rather an opportunity for a constructive modification of Hart's position.

DT Article
DE everyday life; urban studies; fashion; gender; subjectivity; woman's
   dandyism
AB The article discusses the gender aspects of fashion as a social practice indicative of the urban culture of postmodernity. It has been demonstrated that the study of urban culture requires a flexible analysis methodology. The question was raised about the agent of everyday experience at the intersection of phenomenology, urban studies and gender theory. It is shown that the redistribution of gender positions, associated with the weakening of the traditional gender confrontation, accelerated in cities. The fundamental points related to the specifics of the urban diversion were highlighted by Georg Simmel. They remain crucial for the methodology of all levels of urban studies, and form their common logic: a big city is the quintessence of the modern form of life and habitual environment of the bearer of a special type of consciousness. The priority strategy is to describe the emotional expenses of a metropolis resident, the psychological side: to present and to reflect the urban focus as an emotional focus, to emphasize the phenomenological description of a megalopolis resident as a spokesman for a new modus of everyday existence. The subject of the discussion is the question of what renders the profane subject: this applies to most of the values of the life zone, especially constitutive for the physical, bodily manifestations of an individual. The phenomenon of dandyism in its woman's version is thematized. It is shown that the female variety of dandyism structurally repeats the path traversed by the European Dandy from its appearance to the present time, which is reflected in the configurations of historically changing "gender contracts" and "gender compositions" as expressions of male or female strategies of "presenting oneself". The article reveals the perspectives of "dandy's discourse" as a branch of post-feminist ideology.

DE Wittgenstein; Hoffman; pragmatism; rule-following; form of life;
   situation; ethnomethodology; interactionism
AB In 2018, Cambridge Scholars Publishing published a book by French sociologist Albert Ogien, Practical Action: Wittgenstein, Pragmatism and Sociology. Among persons important for Ogien is Harold Garfinkel, the founder of ethnomethodology, and Irving Hoffman, the creator of symbolic interactionism. These authors respond in a similar way to the question of the nature of obligation and common action posed by Durkheim at the dawn of sociology (the community functions through the sharing and execution of common compulsory obligations by individuals). According to Durkheim, common actions can be viewed in the context of the global structure of social order (and attention is focused on the functioning of social institutions), or in the context of practical activity within the framework of direct common actions. Hoffman and Garfinkel choose the second alternative. According to Garfinkel, the production of social order is of a local nature (and it is within this order that social obligations and social norm are found, reproduced and justified). According to Hoffman, the structure of human experience is of decisive importance within the formed frame system. The structure of human experience is (also) reproduced in practical action and does not descend from above social institutions to individuals. This is the main theme of Ogien's microsociological approach. Ogien's new book consists of six small chapters. The biggest ones are devoted to Wittgenstein and to Garfinkel's reading of George Herbert Meade. The final chapter deals with John Dewey's concept of democracy. In the review, the main interest lies in the intersections of pragmatism and sociology traced by Ogien (from theory to empirical research) and in Ludwig Wittgenstein's contribution to sociology (through the prism of a pragmatist approach). Accordingly, the author of the review admits retellings of Ogien's main theses.

AB In recent years, the effectiveness of national health systems has provoked wide-ranging public discussions. The rapid increase in the cost of medical services around the world has significantly exacerbated the problem of effectiveness of previously established health systems. As new priorities emerge, the need to search for innovative approaches to the medical industry and health services development, which can significantly reduce financial costs and increase their efficiency, broadens the problem field of health system research. Today, public health has become a space that requires managerial, institutional and political solutions to ensure the coordination of social and market interests. Currently, the market for new medical services is growing rapidly, but where is the money to increase the financing of high-tech medical care for poor citizens to be found? The article considers these problems within the framework of the cluster model as a possible institutional solution to promoting innovation in the public health realm. The analysis of the results of the clusterization strategy in the medical sphere of the European Union countries shows that health care clusters can be innovative tools for harmonizing public interests and particular interests of a purely economic nature. However, a number of factors impede the realization of such potential in practice. This is due to the lack of comprehensive programs for its development, which should coordinate the efforts of the main stakeholders - the State and local authorities, private companies, researchers and medical staff Developing of "science cities" ("naukogrady") as special areas where conditions for promoting international medical clusters are favorable for meeting public demands, market interests and innovative research can be an effective part of this agenda in Russia. The example of the science city of Troitsk shows that a developed infrastructure, a concentration of highly trained specialists and a conducive social environment constitute significant advantages for implementation of cluster programs.

DE empire; nation; nationalism; imperial center; periphery
AB The article analyzes the approaches to the definition of empire developed in the framework of the theory of nation and nationalism, and their correlation with the theoretical and methodological foundations of understanding the phenomenon of empire in modern political science. The empire and the nation became the main actors in the policies of the modern era, but their interrelationships rarely became the subject of a special study. It is possible to talk about the problematic nature of the "imperial center" as a concept arising in the course of research on imperial topics. In the modern political scientific literature, when analyzing the development of imperial statehood, the center-peripheral approach prevails considering this type of state from the standpoint of functional analysis. The center-peripheral approach focuses on the heterogeneity of the imperial space, the complexity of the governance of the empire, the importance of the imperial bureaucracy, the forms and methods of administration and control in relation to the imperial periphery. Modern research increasingly separates this concept from other terms with which the designation of the imperial power concentration is connected. The empire and the center become abstractions that have lost their institutional value and practical expression. In this connection, the reflection of the imperial problems in the studies of the leading representatives of the theory of nation and nationalism, mainly conducting research in the framework of the constructivist approach, was analyzed. When considering the Russian Empire, it is noted that for Russian researchers, who, as a rule, adhere to the constructivist approach, the conclusion about the inauthentic nature of "official nationalism" in the case of the Russian Eempire is not confirmed. Research argumentation is based on the analysis of the socio-political thought, imperial politics, features of colonial expansion and other factors. According to the results of the study, it was concluded that the opposition of empire and nation does not have sufficient grounds. In the era of modernization, the development of these political forms was largely parallel. It is possible to speak about imperial nationalism as a special form of ideology and political movement opposed to ethnic nationalism. Imperial policy is largely associated with ensuring the exceptional political status, the developing national core in the metropolis of the empire. In terms of methodology, the analysis carried out makes it possible to better distinguish an empire from other types of states with a complex national-ethnic composition.

DE intensionality of mathematics; Godel sentence; consistency; belief
AB The intensionality of mathematical discourse is vividly represented by the features of the proof for Godel's Second Incompleteness Theorem. An undecidable Godel sentence can have various forms of expression with different meanings. The necessary consideration of this kind of intensionality in usually extensional metamathematical statements is connected with the structural features of the construction of a Godel sentence. Especially important are the general characteristics of the Godelian construction, which combines both the Godel sentence G1 of the First Incompleteness Theorem and G2. In particular, establishing the truth of G1 is related to the intensional nature of mathematical discourse to the same extent as in the case of G2. The analysis of the epistemological aspects of the intensionality of the First Theorem is possible through the study of the truth conditions for the Godel sentence. These epistemological consequences include the consideration of the problem of belief in some basic epistemological attitudes in mathematical discourse. It is known that the proof of the existence of an undecidable sentence depends on the assumptions about the validity or consistency of the formal system. The assumption of these concepts gives different strengths to formal constructions, but, in any case, speaking about the truth of the formal system, we must have a guarantee of either validity or consistency, which is intuition based on the belief of mathematicians rooted in mathematical practice. There are two components to establishing the truth of the Godel sentence. First, for all relatively weak formal systems of arithmetic, grasping elementary arithmetic truths, their incompleteness is proved with the corresponding existence of a Godel undecidable sentence. Secondly, the truth of the Godel sentence is determined precisely by the capture of elementary arithmetic truths. In fact, G is both a metamathematical construction and an arithmetic predicate. The incompleteness of relatively weak formal systems of arithmetic is proved in a metamathematical way, and the corresponding Godel's construction G is understood metamathematically. As for the arithmetic predicate G, it is monstrously complex and hardly subject to cognitive understanding. In addition, the transition itself in understanding the nature of G from its metamathematical meaning to the arithmetic one represents a significant "jump", which is a source of difficulties in understanding this problem. Thus, the intensional aspects of mathematical discourse are manifested particularly in the attribution of truth to G1 by virtue of belief in consistency. In fact, this means a "jump of belief" from extensional mathematical discourse to intensional one.

DE neopragmatism; rhetoric; Rorty; Kuhn; epistemological ontological
   hierarchy; relativism; natural sciences; humanitarian knowledge
AB The article deals with Rorty's non-pragmatist position in relation to the relativistic history of science represented by Kuhn in the concept of the structure of scientific revolutions. The transfer of the basic ingredients of Kuhn's methodology of science to philosophy required Rorty to introduce a new rhetoric for the pragmatic version of relativism. Central to this rhetoric is the conception of the fallacy of the epistemic-ontological hierarchy inherent in Kuhn's concept. In this hierarchy, the natural sciences occupy a higher position in knowledge than humanitarian studies of the nature of society and man. The neo-pragmatist rhetoric introduced by Rorty has two goals: on the one hand, to discredit the epistemic-ontological hierarchy by presenting his vision of the development of the natural sciences in the spirit of extreme relativism; on the other hand, to get close to Kuhn's relativism as a paradigm shift. It is shown, firstly, that Kuhn did not accept the identification of his concept with Rorty's relativism, and secondly, that Rorty's non-pragmatist philosophy requires its autonomy from the natural sciences, which reinforces the contradictions between Rorty and Kuhn. In trying to overcome these contradictions, Rorty calls himself a philosopher of "the only marginally 'analytical' kind - the kind with a lot of literary interests, a fondness for metaphor, and other symptoms of intellectual squishiness." This rhetoric illustrates the basic contradiction in Rorty's philosophy: the desire to unite completely different figures into the concept of "reactive" non-systematic abnormal philosophy as an alternative to the analytic philosophy he tailored.

TI A Transforming Paternalism and Its Limits: Some Regularities in Changing
   the Structure of Expectations of the Rural Population of Modern Russia
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE paternalism; rural community; state; transformation; political
   institutions; economic institutions
AB The article shows the features of the transformation of a paternalistic mindset in the modern Russian rural society, and characterizes the place that paternalism occupies in the structure of expectations of the rural population. The article is based on the data (mass and expert surveys) of a sociological research carried out in rural communities of Novosibirsk Oblast from 2005 to 2014. The conducted research allowed to put forward a number of hypotheses regarding the features of the sociocultural transformation of the Russian rural society. In particular, the studies have shown that among the rural population the attitude to paternalism is extremely pronounced. Bright manifestations of paternalism in the rural regions of Russia are fixed by researches of the recent decade. There appears a specific phenomenon, "rural" paternalism, which the author understands as a block of expectations of rural residents associated with the support from the authorities and economic structures. Rural paternalism is represented in rural residents' daily interactions aimed at improving their well-being by receiving support from various political and economic institutions; rural residents realize that it is impossible to survive without this support. The paternalistic attitude has a structure-forming effect on the entire system of expectations that the rural population associates with various power and economic institutions. It determines the hierarchy of expectations, as well as the features of their transformation. Studies show that the expectation of state support continues to occupy a central place in the structure of rural residents' expectations: the state still remains the major and primary recipient of paternalistic expectations. At the same time, a bright feature of the Russian everyday consciousness is an ambiguous attitude to the state (disappointment and hope at the same time). However, studies record changes in the structure of expectations of the rural population. These changes are caused by a permanent socio-economic crisis and a decline in the role of economic entities in the life of rural communities. As a result, there is a shift in public expectations in two directions at once. Firstly, there is a shift in expectations from the state to local authorities. Secondly, there is a shift in expectations from economic actors to political actors. The paternalistic mindset is clearly manifested both among the expert community and among the ordinary rural population. Factors of actualization of paternalistic sentiments are the incorrect formation of modern democratic and market values (unformed attitude to private ownership of land, the feeling of loss from reforms), low social well-being and a general decline in confidence ratings to all levels of government with a simultaneous disruption of horizontal ties.

   KAZAKHSTAN
LA English
DT Article
DE Kazakh historical fiction novel; military cultural code; narrative;
   convention; plausibility; construct; modeling; reference
AB The article deals with representative modeling of the military code in the Kazakh historical novel. The categories of narrative convention, plausibility, generalization, proposed by S. Chatman, with reference to modern Kazakh prose are identified and explored. Military codes make up a significant amount of all cultural codes embedded in the narrative. The referential and phenomenological aspects of the semantics of military code are implemented through a system of implicit and explicit images, motives, and informative descriptions. Military codes are also interpreted in the article as variants within a culturally more extensive nomadic code. The authors claim that the modeling of military codes is a result of a complex process of interactive networking of the marked concepts, from a detailed description of weapons, uniforms and types of military units to fictional military events corresponding to the historical epoch recreated in the narrative. The military codes of specific subject-matter content are accompanied by hidden, intentionally significant mythologems, philosophems, and ideologems. For the documentary and quasi-documentary narratives, the effect of credibility and viability of the presented events, participants and situations is caused by the immersion into the historical context of the work the recipient is supposed to be familiar or unfamiliar with. Establishing associative-allusive connections causes a particular kind of evocation, namely that of " awakening" of the reader's historical memory and of his awareness of the deep continuity with the past. A typology of the military codes of modern Kazakh historical fiction is proposed. It embraces historiosophemes, historical ethnonyms and toponyms, historical realities, philosophems and ideologemes, mythologems, rituals, naming titles of the military, political and priestly hierarchy.

AB Language preferential policy balances inter-ethnic relations. Its scope and character depend on the size and proportion of ethno-linguistic group in a society. At the same time, the set of social and economic factors and political context of "struggle for language" affects this policy. Request for mother tongue in society that was articulated by politicians, political parties, intellectuals and NGOs are markers of the strength and intensity of this struggle. The case study of Wales, analysis of expert reports, statistical data and nonstructured interview allow to reveal the logics and complex configuration of structural and contextual factors of politicization of the Welsh language in XX century. The article focuses on the role of politicians, intellectuals and ordinary public in the struggle for the Welsh language. The factors of de-politicization of the language have been uncovered and explained, which are the institutionalization of the wide-scale language preferential policy and the setup of a public consensus on the status of the Welsh language in the beginning of XXI century.

AB The article is dedicated to the complex analysis of lobbying in the United Kingdom during the late XX - early XXI centuries. Lobbying is an integral element of UK politics, at the same time we still have insufficient knowledge about interest groups. Interaction between interest groups and the government is becoming more diverse and multileveled. The author aims to examine the lobbying mechanism in the UK. The author also analyzes the ways which interest groups and lobbyists use to interact with civil service, QUANGOs, political parties and the parliament, the cabinet of ministers and the prime minister. The article also touches upon the issues concerning the evolution and the current state of lobbying regulation. The author comes to conclusion that tendencies of lobbying development have a twofold nature. On the one hand, interest groups and officials are keen to preserve the mechanism of interaction. For the parties and the government that means receiving information and resources. Interest groups would like to preserve the traditions of openness and to have stable relations with the decision makers. On the other hand, permanent scandals, low level of public trust towards lobbyists and falling legitimacy of the parties force politicians and lobbyists to look for ways of regulation the lobbying environment. Despite the revision of codes of conduct and adoption of the first lobbying law in history, most lobbying relations stay in shadow, because many politicians are concerned that it could limit their freedom in decision making. Hence, the development of lobbying in the UK depends on the balance between preserving the freedom of cooperation between interest groups and the government and transparency of the political process.

AB Defining the relevance of the considered subject, the author emphasizes that it is in many respects caused by that circumstance that, being a basic science, the general theory of state and law takes a leading place in the system of jurisprudence.
   With regard to the modern Russian state and law theorists, it is necessary to recognize that the vast majority, though, unfortunately, not everyone recognizes the fundamental, leading and methodological value of the general theory of state and law. This is very well viewed through the prism of their reasoning on this important and basic problem. Defining the theory of state and law as a common legal science, scientists emphasize that its findings are starting and basic for other legal sciences. However, while agreeing with those scientists who recognize the high status of the general theory of state and law, it should be emphasized that the level of this, undoubtedly, the major science must be high. And this, in its turn, is determined by the content of legal and educational literature. Unfortunately, the quality of educational literature on the theory of state and law leaves much to be desired.
   In the present article the author considers various problems of this fundamental, methodological science on the basis of the critical analysis of the textbook on the theory of state and law written by M. N. Marchenko and E. M. Deryabina. In particular, this concerns the concept of object and subject of the theory of state and law, a civilized approach to the typology of the state, the content of acts of law enforcement, etc. While agreeing, inter alia, with the fact that one of the elements of the form of state is not a political regime, as it is believed by most scholars, but a state regime, the author notes a number of provisions that raise objections or require refinements. For example, it is emphasized that only the subject of the theory of state and law determines the specificity and autonomy of the given legal science. It is argued that the theories of the origin of state and law must be considered separately. Attention is drawn to the fact that it is unacceptable to equate the characteristics and principles of a legal state. The article presents the classification of subjects of legal relations, which, having a number of common features, are represented not only by individuals and legal entities but by social communities, organizations (both governmental and non-governmental ones). The article specifies a civilized approach to the typology of state and law, defines its essence, representatives and various classifications. It is summarized in conclusion that among the objective and subjective factors contributing to a high level of legal education, the importance of the theory of state and law literature, which does not always meet proper requirements, cannot be underestimated.
   factors causing the high level of legal education, the important place is taken by quality of educational literature according to the theory of the state and the right which not always conforms to due requirements.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Paul I; fiction; memoirs; Emperor; image
AB The article is devoted to the study of the influence of contemporary memories on the formation of the image of Emperor Paul I in fiction. The study is based on the play "Pavel I" [Paul I] by D. Merezhkovsky and the story "Poruchik Kizhe" [Lieutenant Kije] by Yu. Tynyanov, whose plots were mainly borrowed from memoirs published in the second half of the 19th-early 20th centuries. The main aim of the study is to identify the relationship between the image of Paul I created in the texts of writers and playwrights and the memories of contemporaries who recorded their ideas and knowledge on the pages of memoirs. It is obvious that representatives of the literary community, as well as scientists, extensively used memoirs as a source of information for writing their works. Moreover, following historical science, fiction has also contributed to the consolidation of the image of Emperor Paul I as a madman on the throne in the eyes of a wide range of readers. During the research, not only the memories of contemporaries, but also scientific works about the era of Paul I written by historians N.K. Shilder, Yu. A. Sorokin, A.N. Bokhanov were used. The image of the Emperor presented in fiction was undoubtedly influenced by the writers' own ideas about the nature of the Russian autocracy, as well as their attitude directly to the personality of the sovereign himself. To a greater extent, this is noticeable in Merezhkovsky's work "Pavel I", but Tynianov's work, written in the Soviet period, also contains the ridicule of the vices of Paul I and his era. Along with telling about the negative qualities of the Emperor, writers followed many memoir authors and noted his positive characteristic features, which raised the reader's interest in the work. In general, the analysis of fiction of the first third of the 20th century devoted to the personal qualities and state activities of Russian Emperor Paul I shows that writers borrowed many plot lines from the memories of contemporaries. Writers and playwrights, relying on the well-known complex of memoir texts and research works, under the influence of their own historical and political views, portrayed the Russian monarch mainly as an unbalanced and severe monarch, thus repeating the most stable cliches that developed in the historiography of the second half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The image was broadcast to a wide readership, embodied in films and on the theatrical stage, becoming the basis for established judgments about the nature and activities of Emperor Paul I. The real personality of the monarch was in the shadow of the stereotype.

ID INTENSIVE BUSINESS SERVICES
AB The article deals with trade in services between Russia and the European Union. The emphasis is put on the export of services from Russia to the EU as a potential source of transformation of the structure of trade relations between the parties, which are now lined up with a significant imbalance, exacerbated by sanctions and the major political crisis in the Russia-EU relations which started at 2014. The author analyzes two hypotheses: the possibility to develop traditional export-oriented service industries in Russia - such as transportation and construction, - and service industries based on knowledge and new technologies. In the first case, the competitive advantage of Russian companies is the geographical position of the country between China and Europe, which, coupled with a developed IT field, allows Russian companies offering competitive logistics solutions. In the second case, the advantage is again the developed IT field in Russia and the market niches in the EU which are less occupied allowing easier entrance for the new firms. The research method is comparison of current exports of services from Russia to the EU in terms of industries and geography of supplies with the EU market demand for services. The author takes into account the trends in the economic environment in the region. The emphasis is put on the digitalization and new communication technologies. The general conclusion is that the services sector can become one of the drivers of the restructuring of economic ties between Russia and the European Union, although Russian exporters should adjust their supply to the growing demand in the European markets for knowledge-intensive services. The focus should be made on industries that combine both the existing competitive advantages and the new competencies of Russian companies which are efficient in the emerging markets of new types of services. Among them there are intermediary activities in e-commerce (the development of national marketplaces), as well as digital types of telecommunications.

DE ecological parties; "greens"; "green party family"; Western Europe;
   parliamentary elections; electoral systems; post-materialistic values
AB The article analyzes the latest trends in political developments, specific for the west-european ecological parties during the second decade of the 21st century. Common features and peculiarities of each party's electoral activities, place and role in the European "green party family" are investigated. Special attention is given to the contemporary "green" ideology which reflects the patterns of the Post-materialism epoch. Today, the "green" parties present themselves as a political force committed to the principles of environmental responsibility, global sustainable development, "universal democracy", respect for diversity, personal freedom, gender equality and non-violence, etc., which constitute post-materialistic values. In the political sphere, the European "greens" have undergone a gradual transformation from a radical alternative political force into a moderate alternative one. They have become less critical towards the State, support economic development, but are skeptical when it comes to any military activity. The author concludes that the popularity of "green" parties in Europe generally grows, although slowly and unevenly. The ecological parties have been most successful in the countries with proportional election system (Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Iceland), which initially became the core of the European "green party family". The case of the German "Bandnis 90/Die Granen" as the biggest ecological party in Europe is particularly examined. In all countries, temporary fluctuations take place - whether the increase or, on the contrary, the decrease of the parties' electoral support, which depends on changes in general political conjuncture. Nevertheless, the data and facts are witnessing a common tendency of strengthening of the "greens' positions in elected bodies at all levels (including the European Parliament). Similar elements and trends in political advancement of the European ecological parties during the latest decades, despite country-related differences, confirm the "green partyfamily" concept, which is thus a correct approach to the European Green Movement.

DT Book Review
DE public sociology; narrative turn; ethnography turn; marginality; social
   exclusion; urban poor
AB This book changed the views of the scientific community and ordinary Americans about the urban poor and won the author recognition among the left, closing the door to the camp of neo-liberals and earning him a promotion to an academic position at Harvard University. However, the main effect was that this book and others by S. Venkatesh, written in the style of the new ethnography, raise the degree of public, scientific and political discussion about racial discrimination and what kind of model of American capitalism was acquired by the end of the twentieth century. Showing the close relationship between social exclusion, poverty and crime, Gang Leader for the Day: A Rogue Sociologist Takes to the Streets reveals the hypocrisy of the slogans about equality of opportunity and the perfection of American capitalism. Why does social policy fail in American cities? How exactly does the institutional structure of the capitalist economy and American democracy contribute to the social exclusion of the black population? Why did the mass construction of the ghetto not solve any of the problems that were designated by the initiators of the American project?
   Asking these and other questions, the author comes to disappointing conclusions. The combination of structural restrictions and cultural experience leads to the fact that ghetto residents develop social relations, follow those behaviors that marginalize their neighborhoods and nullify the chances of success for present and future generations. Formally, this work is difficult to attribute to a scientific monograph. However, researchers of a broad humanitarian profile should pay attention to it. In addition to a rich description of a closed community, the book gives a deep understanding of what constitutes ethnographic and narrative turns in modern-day sociology.
   This book review begins with a description of the genre's originality and the differences between the presented book and classical academic studies. Then, we discuss how, due to the rejection of the academic mainstream, S. Venkatesh demonstrates the productivity of innovative ethnography in studies of marginality. To acquaint the Russian audience with the enormous contribution that sociologist S. Venkatesh made to the development of modern Western ethnography, his first and, so far, only book translated into Russian is compared with his earlier monograph. It is carried out in strict accordance with the academic canon and contains a deep analysis of the socioeconomic deprivation of black ghettos within the context of the American model of neoliberal capitalism. The text of this article concludes with a discussion about how Gang Leader for the Day simultaneously reflects an ethnographic and narrative turn that occurred in the social sciences in the final quarter of the last century.

SO RUSIN
LA Ukrainian
DT Article
DE Great Patriotic War; historical policy; politics of memory; national
   discourses; Slavic world; Russian nation; Germany
AB The article studies the infiltration of the national discourse, the Russian (wider Slavic) myth into the USSR historical policy during the Great Patriotic war of 19411945 as reflected in Siberian periodicals and archival documents. It is emphasized that this transformation had situational preconditions related to the strategic choice of the Soviet Union for Slavic unity in the fight against Nazi Germany as well as psychological origins, appealing to the deep archetypes of national consciousness. The intellectual potential of North Asia as well as that of the whole country was summoned up as the "school of mass political education", which brought about the revived cult of national heroes and the neo-romantic representation of the Russian nation and the Slavic peoples as having exceptional qualities and opposed to the German world. Such trends were reflected in newspaper publications devoted to the heroic pages of Russian history (the Battle on the Ice, the struggle against foreign invaders during the Time of Troubles, the Patriotic War of 1812, World War I, etc.) as well as to Alexander Nevsky, Dmitry Donskoy, M.I. Kutuzov and others. It is noted that the exclusivity of the Russian nation was opposed to the ethno-cultural traditions of the Germans. At the same time, the politics of memory in the war period shows a deep contradiction between the representation of Germany as of an ethnogenetic enemy of the Slavs and an attempt to preserve the Soviet international view and mercy to the people affected by the "plague". This contradiction can be seen in the general eclecticization of historical policy, which, on the one hand, appealed to the primordial national symbols and, on the other hand, preserved the traditional Soviet vocabulary, rhetoric and symbols, which ultimately resulted in the primacy of pride for the people chosen not only to liberate the world from Nazism, but also to carry out the Great Revolution of 1917.

DT Article
DE natural disasters; disaster reduction; UN; international law
AB The study, the subject of which is the global increase of natural disaster risk, is devoted to the topic of international opposition to this trend. The author considers organizational and legal aspects of the struggle to draw attention to ineffectiveness of the resistance strategy conducted at the global level today, and to point out the need to accelerate the development of regulatory and institutional regulation there. The increase of emergency situations on Earth in number and extent creates a security problem that requires coordination of defensive efforts by states as well as complementation of each other's material and intellectual resources. Such cooperation serves as a new factor of the regular world integration. The plan of universal events announced in 2000 - the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction - and regular world forums devoted to the problem could be its organizational platform in the considered sphere. The decrees and the bodies that appeared on this basis are, in fact, the developments for global disaster risk management. According to the United Nations concept, it should provide for the sustainable development amid disasters and temperature changes, together with the other two UN projects - Agenda 21 and the Paris Climate Agreement. However, during the 30-year period of the United Nations' "extraordinary" initiative promotion, the strategists and the entire campaign launched in 1989 have never fulfilled their assigned tasks. Analyzing the main provisions of the program documents and possibilities of typical means for their implementation, the author comes to a conclusion that it is impossible to achieve once planned "substantial reduction of losses" by dint of the current organizational base and counteraction potential used. In order to strengthen the protection against natural disasters, it is proposed to intensify the process of international obligations development with a view to the subsequent transition from recommendatory to legal regulation of it. In order to reflect Russia's interest for a legally guaranteed security system adequately, it is necessary to shape a political plan for development of a new area of interstate relations, which would provide for measures to influence their regulatory and institutional basis improvement. The study should contribute to an objective assessment of the state of a f fairs, help predict the development in the universal sphere of cooperation to combat disasters, and prepare proposals to improve the effectiveness of civil defense management.

DT Article
DE historical macro-sociology; research program; theoretical history;
   structural history; general historical laws; nonlinear historical
   processes
AB This article is devoted to the problem of substantiation of the structure and form of organization of social cognition, so that it can effectively perform the functions of explanation and prediction. To resolve this problem, the methodological analysis model of macro-historical dynamics by Randall Collins has been taken. It is established that Collins's model is organized in accordance with the model of Imre Lakatos's research program. It is noted that this model is the most optimal form of construction of social epistemology. The core of Collins's program is the Weberian thesis about the legitimacy of the state, its prestige of power, principles of geopolitical dynamics of states. The structure of the protective belt of Collins's program includes provisions on the role of communications and efforts to maintain them, the importance of diplomatic alliances; positive heuristics is formed by the idea of the leading role of geopolitics in relation to various spheres of society. On the basis of the provisions of the core of his program, Collins sets forth certain macro-historical hypotheses. These include the geopolitical hypothesis of revolution as a state disintegration, the geopolitical hypothesis of ethnicity and ethnic dynamics, the geopolitical hypothesis of democracy as a set of structures of collective power, the "four-dimensional" model of modernization, the hypothesis of market dynamics in history (it replaces the concept of mode of production), the hypothesis of "self-transforming capitalism". Collins complements this explanatory model with the prediction model, which is based on the hypothesis of general historical laws of Carl Hempel. The article shows that the heuristic capabilities of Collins's program are explained by the implementation of these models, so that it brings social cognition to a high level of theorization. This is manifested in the justification of Collins's thesis about the theoretical load of the empirical foundation of social knowledge. It is also important that Collins explains and predicts with the help of modern scientific concepts that are part of his program and are involved in the formulation of macro-historical hypotheses. Among these concepts are the principles of a system approach, cybernetics and elements of probability theory. Thus, the model of Collins's macro-historical dynamics reveals the structure of social cognition consisting of three levels. The meta-theoretic level, by means of which the problems of social cognition are solved, forms modern scientific concepts. The middle level is formed by social theories that explain the dynamics of economic, political and cultural spheres. The lower level involves the practical application of social knowledge through the creation of long-term social action strategies. Collins's model overcomes the one-sidedness of the narrowly empirical approach in social cognition, reveals the possibility of establishing close links between the latter and the methodology of science.

AB The present article is devoted to the abuses and circumvention of regulations in the civil law, in the situation of foreign countries sanctions. Modern geopolitics ask for our country's timely legal and political reactions to the increasing sanctions of foreign countries. Such a situation is skillfully combined with the consequences of the global financial crisis and is a fertile ground for the growth of fictitious bankruptcies, unilateral refusal of fulfilling civil-law obligations, and actions to bypass the law. Abuses and circumvention of regulations in the civil law can be sustainable prerequisites for the growth of crimes in the conditions of sanctions in foreign countries. The work was performed under the grant of the President of the Russian Federation for the state support of young Russian scientists and candidates of Sciences (Competition - MK-918.2018.6). The subject of study is the "Legal challenges to improve the quality and competitiveness of goods, works and services under the sanctions of civil turnover of the Russian Federation".

AB The article attempts to develop an algorithm for analyzing on-line statements of various social groups on the accessibility of the urban environment. Results of the analysis can be used in the design of urban development strategies. The focus of the research is aimed at identifying the problems of urban well-being for everyone. In modern conditions, there has appeared a unique opportunity to carry out such an analysis using spontaneous data, which are created by social network users. Messages created in the social media necessitate the development of approaches, tools and methods of analysis for structured and unstructured voluminous and diverse data, which are created in the virtual space and are supported by social networks. The distinctive characteristic of the approach proposed is that it analyses not only on-line statements of people with disabilities on special sites and forums, but also the general context for discussing the problems of the urban environment by different communities and public groups is reconstructed. The possibilities of the structural-semantic analysis of the on-line statements made by the representatives of three main groups (officials, citizens and people with disabilities) on the problem of the formation of an accessible environment have led to an unambiguous conclusion: the social life of urban strata demonstrates a high degree of inequality and weak mobility opportunities for the majority of the population.

DE intellectuals; civil self-organization; social dynamics; method of
   theoretical history; coalition conflict theory
AB The paper analyzes the modern conditions of cooperation between intellectuals and civil society activists as independent social actors in various states in typologically similar historical cases. The research is based on the theoretical position-historical approach of Nikolay S. Rozov, the coalition conflict theory of Robert Wuthnow, and modern concepts of the sociology of social movements' paradigm. These methodological approaches provide a modern assessment to the phenomenon of cooperation between intellectuals and civil society activists. The author interprets the role of intellectuals in the development of civil self-organization processes as a variable, whose value is determined by the severity of causal factors. The level of influence is high in a situation of increasing the intensity of the intellectuals' integration into civil self-organization processes. Thus, the components of the integration success should be considered as indicators of the growth of the intellectuals' influence on the studied processes. The empirical basis of the study is made up of cases of cooperation between intellectuals and social movements' activists in Latin America (Brazil, Mexico), Eastern Europe, and Russia in the second half of the twentieth century. The author identifies social conditions that are significant for the success of interaction between intellectuals and civil society activists. They are the political opportunity structure, the level of organizational potential of subjects of civic engagement, features of the social status of intellectuals, the formation of a social interaction channel, the content of communicative practices of intellectuals and civil society activists. The case study shows that the successful intellectuals' integration to the practices of civil self-organization is possible not only in a situation of political competition, but also in a closed political system with the absence of political opposition. Theoretical and historical analysis allows noticing the instability of the intellectuals' social status and signs of their stigmatization, such as non-recognition of their projects, loss of social status and repressions by the political elite. The study of the intellectuals' integration into the grassroots practices suggests that the success of cooperation in most of the cases depends on the lack of access for the groups of civic interests to the centers of political decision making; the development of a "stalemate situation" characterized by a lingering balance of power between representatives of the political and economic elite of states; the requirement to movements' resource mobilization. The author concludes that the development of self-organization also contributes to the formation of alternative material foundations of cultural production through the establishment of cooperative relations with intellectuals.

AB The aim of the article is to reveal the dependence of social and economic representations of the "uneducated" class (peasants) on the sociocultural conditions of their life during a specific period of the European history. For this purpose, it is necessary to find out what a human being is and what connects people with each other; to describe the living conditions of society; to find out which circumstances initiate people's activity in society; to define what the purpose of public life is. The combination of hermeneutic, dialectic, and phenomenological methods allows to understand the place and role of a person who represents the "uneducated" class in the structure of the European society in the 17th-18th centuries. Peasants' views on the world in general, the society organization, their standards of living, socio-economic ideas found reflection in folklore. Studying European (German, French, Scandinavian, Russian) fairy tales collected by Charles Perrault, the brothers Grimm, Alexander Afanasyev, and works of Fernand Braudel and Robert Darnton allow to draw a conclusion that for ordinary people fairy tales served as means of communication, education, transmission of traditions and cultural schemes. Harmonious communication with nature is found when characters of fairy tales work on land and hunt. Their dearest wish is to get a magic object as a gift and not to need food any more, which reflects the agrarian orientation of economy, the natural reasons of deficiency of means for life. Images of silly, greedy, lazy rich men and of poor people who are forced to work to earn a living, not to get rich, indicate not only the understanding of the unfair social structure by an ordinary person, but also offer available means of maintenance of the socio-economic balance: cunning, wit, resourcefulness, and also theft, deception. Financial interest is a common condition for people's activity in European fairy tales. The image of a fool in Russian folklore discloses the non-economic value of human life in harmony with nature. Society ignores the contemplative activity of a person as it does not lead to a change of the surrounding space, but can call into question the bases of the social fabric in which financial interest acts as a condition of society's existence, and human activity is a condition of its functioning.

AB The article analyzes the phenomenon of the formation of a network communicative culture among the digital generation in the social media space in the field of interpersonal relations on the example of quasi-close virtual relationships of virtual flirting, friending and trolling. The analysis of the concepts of re-socialization of interpersonal relations under the influence of social media is presented. The key positions and problems of Jan van Dijk's concepts of controllability of the relations and Mirca Madianou & Daniel Miller's polymedia are considered. A study of the virtual communication culture of the Tomsk university students as representatives of the network generation Z with a high digital competence was made. The methods used in the study were analyzing creative essays on a given topic, in-depth interviews and focus groups, both offline and online. The study thematized role-nomination and filling of virtual quasi-close relationships as an element of the new network communication culture. It is argued that virtual romantic relationships in social networks are perceived by the majority of informants in a frivolous, playful, surrogate format of flirting, which can grow/not grow into close relationships only in the case of offline meetings. With regard to virtual friendship, it is confirmed that, in the eyes of most respondents, exceptional on-line friending is simulative, since for really close relationships, it lacks the participant's personal investments and the opportunity to create an adequate image of a partner due to limited communication channels and lack of social cues. At the same time, social networks, as support for real friendships, are actively used. It is also noted that representatives of the digital generation are well aware of the simulative nature of such a social activity as trolling (partly due to the psychopathological reasons) manifested in anonymity, lack of personal intentionality and serious (cost-resource) consequences, as well as the ability to interrupt an unnecessary contact at any time. Conclusions are made about the explosive growth in the volume of relations, in particular, the increase in the number of friends, by reducing the cost of maintaining relationships with each of them; the downside is in the form of reducing the value of such relationships for participants and their consequent simulation-game nature.

ID LOGIC
AB The article investigates the notion of an authority relation between agents from two perspectives. Its first part argues that the existence of an authority relation between agents, with respect to some state of affairs, means that an agent who is in authority has an ability to command to act in order to see to it that such state of affairs is true. A command of that kind is modelled in NEXT-semantics. Here an impact of one agent on another is pictured as a composition of accessibility relations between the worlds. A case of an embedded authority relation and a case of presupposed conditions are investigated. The second part of the article argues that an authority relation between agents, with respect to some state of affairs, exists due to a personal and immediate ability of an agent, who is in authority, to make that state of affairs true. Here an authority relation is interpreted on process graphs as a transitive move to the third world from the first one (where an agent who is in authority acts) via the second world (where an agent who is under authority acts) or as an ability of one agent to use others as a proxy for his or her actions. Such an ability is modelled for three agents by means of a special relation that can distinguish equivalent classes on process graphs. Finally, the article introduces some semantic ideas which are to make further synthesis of the logic of action and PDL fruitful.

ID DEFLATIONISM
AB The restrictive results of Kurt Godel and Alfred Tarski are often interpreted as a final demonstration for the impossibility of expressing the semantic characteristics of a theory by syntactic means. At the same time, the seemingly unshakable results have undergone significant revisions in recent decades. For example, the desire to overcome the hierarchical approach to the truth definition gave rise to the rapidly developing direction of creating untyped truth theories, going back to Saul Kripke. The article offers an analysis for the possibility of expressing, by syntactic means, the semantic characteristics of a theory applied to the problem of implicit commitments arising from the adoption of a mathematical theory and the axiomatic truth theory. The very problem of identifying implicit commitments, both in the case of adopting a mathematical theory, and in the case of adopting the truth theory, is far from its final resolution. The article shows that the rationale for adopting the principle of reflection in the case of the truth theory and the application of an autonomous progression in the case of implicit commitments for a mathematical theory adopting shows that modem philosophical logic is able to offer logical-syntactic tools for explication of semantic concepts of truth and implicit commitment for adopting a mathematical theory. This is a serious argument both in favor of the deflationary concept of truth, which interprets the latter as an exclusively logical-mathematical concept, and in favor of the statement that the semantic content of formal-mathematical concepts can be explicated by syntactic means.

AB This article analyses the development of higher education in Siberia during the Soviet era and specifically the state policies which governed the training of history teachers. The author's sources include publications of Russian scholars, the Soviet era standards and laws which underpinned the education system, archive documents from Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Chita and Ulan-Ude, written memoirs and interviews with graduates of Eastern Siberian teaching colleges. The research work was carried out in accordance with the methodological apparatus of historical science and the principles of historicism using historical-genetic and historical-systemic methodology. In the first part of the work, the author establishes that teachers in the Soviet era were responsible both for the education of their students and for the formation of their Marxist-Leninist worldview, and that the state regulated all of the processes which took place in the secondary and higher education system. In the second part of the work, the author examines how the historical education system was reformed, how the changes were responsible for the formation of the "New Man" and the Marxist-Leninist worldview, how the "Thaw' opened new opportunities for historians but the domination of the Marxist methodology hindered the research potential of historical science and education, and how the reforms led to the development of a new methodological apparatus for the training of future history teachers. In the third part of the work, the author focuses on the practical elements - curricula, specific teaching practices and training methods, which included the study of scientific, psychological-pedagogical and special-historical disciplines, the dual-purpose reason for the changes - shaping the worldview of future history teachers and deepening their Marxist-Leninist training, and the required participation by students in socio-political, labour, and artistic activities also based on this goal. The author comes to the following conclusions. (1) A powerful education system was created in the Soviet era resulting in intellectual growth for the country and strengthened public consciousness. (2) The training of history teachers was a matter of particular importance to the state. (3) Through a combination of new educational, scientific and social processes, Eastern Siberian teaching colleges produced highly qualified professional teachers, which also contributed to the preparation of employees for the region's party organizations.

AB The article attempts to clarify the theoretical and methodological potential of the concept of the technological structure of the information society in understanding the direction and nature of the transformation of family relations during the transformation of modern social reality. The problem situation, which is articulated within the socio-philosophical reflection, involves searching for answers to the following questions: What is the ontological and axiological orientation of modern social processes within the framework of the sixth technological revolution? How does the technological development affect the transformation of social reality? The aim of the research is to explain the narrowness of technocratic approaches in understanding the specifics of the technological structure of the information society exclusively in technical and technological projections, ignoring the anthropological, socio-cultural, axiological aspects of its functioning. The objectives of the research are as follows: a categorical analysis of the concepts of the technological structure and family relations; identification of the relationship between the shifts in the family and the broader context of societal transformations, articulated by Pitirim Sorokin, Ulrich Beck, Anthony Giddens, Alvin Toffler, Scott Lash. At the core of the modern technological structure are technological innovations, revolutionizing the economy and becoming a sustainable cluster of production. The key factors of its development are biotechnology, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence. Social infrastructure is incorporated into the technological structure as a system of reproduction of human capital and is represented by culture, science, education, and media. The modern family is one of the central social systems, which is undergoing transformations as a result of the influence of the technological structure of the information society, whose ontology has a communicative nature. It is shown that critical reflection on the impact of the technological structure of the information society on the transformation of family relations reveals the tendency that social development occurs through technical breakthroughs and innovations, but must correlate with the nature of the socio-cultural processes as well.

AB This article aims to study the formation and development of international scientific relations of researchers of Yenisei Siberia in the last third of the 19th century. International communication today cannot be overestimated. It contributes to the development of research collaboration, development of science, international exchange of information and integration of Russian provincial science into international research. The problem is solved in the following stages: (1) exploring the development of the region; (2) determining foreign expeditions; (3) exploring the communication of the researchers; (4) determining patterns of development of foreign contacts. The following methods have been applied in the research: the historical comparative method has been applied together with the historical-genetic analysis to have a full view of the spheres of collaboration and the significance of these contacts for the development of science in Yenisei Siberia. The problem has been studied in part in the works of E.G. Vodichev, L.B. Us, E.A. Dudzinskaya, S.A. Proskurin, B.I. Melekhin, S.K. Romanovsky. The research refers to a great variety of sources that are stored in the archives of Russia. Archive data and publications of the local and national press have been analyzed to provide the reliability of the conclusions. The research reviews the main stages of communication development, notes its essential role in the development and popularization of science on the territory of Yenisei Province. However, international collaboration of this region is yet to be studied and described for a detailed analysis. The international scientific relations played an important role in the genesis and popularization of science in Yenisei Siberia. It is stated that collaboration was carried out with Germany, Finland, the United Kingdom, France, Hungary, Norway, the United States of America in different spheres such as archeology, ethnography, history, linguistics, geology, ornithology, zoology, botany. The forms of cooperation were diverse: collections exchange, participation in conferences, cooperative research, visits, scientific correspondence. As a result of the investigation, it is stated that international scientific relations were represented as a complex structure with a plenitude of directions and forms of development. The data analysis led to the conclusion that scientific communication depended on the political, economic, social and cultural situation. To sum up, the researchers largely benefited from the cooperation, and those links were useful for the both parties.

DE ethics; morality; moral objectivity; moral universality
AB Objectivity and universality of moral requirements and moral judgments are the central formal and functional features of morality. Moral objectivity means that moral judgments are not reducible to approval or disapproval of actions by particular individuals or particular cultural groups. Those who use the moral vocabulary for judging actions consider their claims not as mere expressions of their preferences or mere expressions of beliefs commonly held in their communities, but as correct (right) evaluations made on the basis of correct (right) requirements. The phenomenology of moral experience and empirical moral psychology support the thesis that moral requirements and judgments are generally regarded to be objective. Moral philosophy, in its turn, has some compelling reasons to approve this pretension because the recognition of moral objectivity makes it possible to hold strong moral beliefs and to sustain productive discussions on moral matters. Universality of a moral requirement means that it relies upon such a description of a morally significant situation that does not mention any particular individual. A universal requirement establishes a circle of actors obliged to do something, and a circle of recipients who should be treated impartially. The contemporary ethical theory puts forward three approaches to the problem of the correlation between moral objectivity and universality. The first insists on their mutual independence and the possibility of two positions: relativistic objectivism and universalistic subjectivism. The second approach denies the independence of universality, and transforms it into an additional property of some objective requirements and judgments. Thus, relativistic objectivism remains possible, while universalistic subjectivism does not. For supporters of the third approach, objectivity and universality are two inseparable sides of the same feature of morality. The author argues for the third approach. He shows that (a) universalistic subjectivism is possible only if universality proper is substituted by general acceptance and (b) relativistic objectivism is possible only if universality proper is substituted by a high level of generality. Then the author adds one more argument for the third approach: objective requirements should be rationally justified, and we can rationally justify only universal requirements.

DE desemanticization; figurative representation; political myth; construct;
   frame; leader; Motherland; patriotism; deconstruction; destruction
AB The first part of the article reveals the framework nature of the models of totalitarian constructions of Russia's political reality. The authors assume that in the subsequent periods during the restructuring of the meaning matrix there was a desacralization of the supporting constructs "Lenin" and "Motherland". The article substantiates this hypothesis, and reveals how these symbols lost their political significance. This is the result of an "incomplete" deconstruction, when the initial meaning is "debunked", but no reinvention occurs. Due to the loss of meaning, political images lose their figurative representativeness and communicative relevance, these signs become "empty" forms. The second part contains the case study of the deconstruction of the myth about Lenin. Initially, the myth-structure "Lenin" lost its heroic semantic content and became senseless. The article highlights the historical "milestones" of the desemanticization of the symbol "Lenin": the official reconstruction of the basic heroic monomyth into a truncated construct of a transformed myth of Lenin; anecdotes about Lenin as a form of the deconstruction of the myth; the "fake" and "meme" deconstruction and the de-anthropologization of "Lenin".
   All this affected the figurative leadership representation of Soviet and post-Soviet Russia, depriving it of its "ultimate" myth bases. The case of the "complete" deconstruction of the myth of Lenin is related to the attempt of his scientific rethinking. This contributed to the revision of not only the heroic and demiurgic role and "overturning" legitimizing semantic guidelines in relation to the heroic myth of the Soviet Russia, but also of the Revolution as the origin of the political reality. In the third part, the "case" of the dramatic destruction of the "Motherland" construct was analysed, which led to the desacralization of such a semantic political phenomenon as "patriotism". The source material for the authors' comparison was the totalitarian school materials, which prescribed semantic figurative constructions and frames of understanding of the Soviet patriotism. As a result, the modern political communication on the topic of patriotism has lost its significant definiteness, and its identity has become extremely negative.

DE de re attitude reports; de re/de dicto distinction; concept generators;
   type-flexibility of attitude predicates
AB This critical review presents the current state of the art in the approaches to semantic analysis of attitude reports. The authors present to the reader who is not familiar with the technicalities of the contemporary formal linguistic theory the essence of the de re and de dicto attitude reports as they were originally presented in the seminal work of Bertrand Russell. They continue with a discussion of the so-called double-vision scenarios discovered by Willard Quine and show how they are a problem of a compositional semantic analysis. Then the authors move on to discuss the most influential approaches towards accounting for de re attitude reports. The overview centers on the approaches by David Kaplan, David Lewis, Irene Heim, Orin Percus and Uli Sauerland. It is shown that a number of original syntactic problems, as well as problems with compositionality were solved in the most recent and influential theory of concept generators. Yet, the authors point out a number of problems that still remain unsolved. One such problem is the so-called flexibility of attitude verbs that stipulates their ability to combine with arguments with potentially any complexity. For some, it may seem as a technical glitch of the theory. Yet, the authors point out that any theory that could avoid type-flexibility and yield the same results as the theory of concept generators would be preferable. A second problem pointed out by the authors is more substantial. It has to do with counterexamples that cannot be captured by the standard approaches, in principle. The authors provide such examples. They are the so-called reports about a disjunctive attitude in which an attitude holder believes or desires something or other, but both of desires can be said to relate to one and the same individual, from the speaker's perspective. The speaker is thus justified to attribute the overall desire or believe of the attitude holder to this individual, ignoring the fact that the attitude holder herself does not know that either disjuncts of her disjunctive desire are attributable to one and the same individual. This setup creates a de re attitude reports that cannot be captured in terms of a standard approach in terms of concept generators because this approach fails to meet one requirement of these examples: make sure that different concepts can be applicable in different attitude alternatives of the attitude holder. In other words, in order to account for reports about disjunctive attitudes, no single concept generator can be sufficient. The authors observe that this kind of problem goes beyond just the theory of concept generators, and targets all the neo-Kaplanian approaches because it questions the correctness of the popular philosophical assumption that underlies these approaches: whether the attitude holder must be somehow acquainted with the object of which the de re report is made and that the attitude holder must have a certain unique description for this object by which she should apply in each of her attitude alternatives.

AB The article analyzes the features of the institutionalization of the national justice of Ossetians and Ingush in the conditions of their incorporation into the political and legal space of the Russian Empire on the example of a mixed jury, which existed in 1908-1910. The place of a mixed jury trial in the judicial system of the Terek region in the early 20th century, in which both formal (state) and informal (people's) institutions functioned, is considered. Such traditional institutions of socio-normative culture of the Ossetians and the Ingush applied in judicial practice, as compensation for the murder ("payment for blood"), infliction of wounds and injuries, theft, are described. Mutual responsibility as the main measure of responsibility for violation of the principles of social justice, as well as the oath and testimony of witnesses as a form of proof of guilt / innocence of the defendant are analysed in details. The principles of formation and replenishment of people's cash registers, from which material compensation was paid to the injured party by the decision of the mixed court, were studied. It is concluded that the reception of the customs and traditions of Ossetians and Ingush by consolidating their people's will in the Russian legal acts regulating the activities of the mixed court, retained the functional importance of national justice and laid the foundation for the formation of the subsequent Russian civil consciousness.

DE ethnic mobilization; ethnic leadership; native grounds; Ob Ugrians;

AB Introduction: the traditional culture of the Khanty and Mansi was under threat of extinction in the 1980s due to the industrial development of Yugra and Soviet policy. Perestroika, which began in the USSR, stimulated the ethnic mobilization of the Ob Ugrians. The prevailing view was that indigenous peoples should decide their own fate. An initiative group of the Ob Ugrians with the help of the Okrug authorities has established the "Yugra Rescue" - Association of indigenous peoples of the North. Its main merit was the consolidation of aboriginal rights to lands in the regional legislation, that stopped uncontrolled expansion of oil companies.
   Objective: to determine the reasons of the success of ethnic mobilization of the Ob Ugrians in 1988-1992.
   Research materials: the article is based on studies on ethnic mobilization, introduces unpublished archival materials of the Association and memoirs of the participants.
   Results and novelty of the research: the article deals with the peculiarities of mobilization of the Ob Ugrians in the context of the general ethnic revival in the USSR. It defines the main actors and presents the historical and emotional context of their actions; details the history of the Regulation of native grounds. In retrospect, the sequence of those events seems obvious, but a detailed analysis shows that every step in this story was innovative and controversial, it caused counteraction, and the result of it was not predictable. Only determined efforts allowed achieving the result and, thus, create the prerequisites for the next step. At each turn, the leaders had to defend their position, look for supporters and resources for further advancement. This Khanty-Mansiysk case for the Russian North is unique in terms of the coordination of the actions of the national elite and local authorities, the timing of the implementation of ideas and effectiveness.
   Through the motivations of the leaders, the institutions and ideologies behind them, a competitive political field and the likelihood of different future scenarios for the indigenous peoples are shown. The selected optics allowed a new characterization of the ethnic movement of the Ob Ugrians during the Perestroika.

   The intention of the article is to prove the necessity of more detailed heritage' studies based on comparative analysis of these theories representatives, primarily American scientists who are developing the basics of postindustrial society. Taking into consideration the postulates of information society' theory, the following conclusion is drawn: post-industrial (information) society is based on the principles of minority, semi-direct democracy and shared responsibility in decision-making.
   Much attention is given to the negative consequences of Russia blind following the western doctrine of information society construction. As opposed to the information theory, the knowledge theory starts to develop, which is about providing opportunities to check the validity of the information, comparing it with other information types, grading and comprehending it, while using general scientific methodology, with the aim of new system building and reproducing it based on received information by any party concerned. The method proposed is about using hermeneutics, ways of interpreting legal and political texts and formal logic, scientific works of researched representatives' theories systematic analysis.
   The following conclusions are drawn: it is necessary to build. knowledge society. in Russia based on the achievements of information society, as also on the development of fundamental sciences opposed to the current priority of applied knowledge with the purpose of further social and legal state strengthening.

AB The modern world offers opportunities to be educated and trained in different countries. Leading universities often provide foreign students with a number of educational programs in their native language. However, in most cases, a foreign student has to master a host country language. Thus, in order to get higher education in Russia, foreign citizens learn Russian. Studying Russian as a foreign language allows foreigners to be taught in the chosen field in Russian. Therefore, studying Russian as a foreign language in the educational and vocational sphere is one of the major tasks at the preuniversity education stage. Daily practice shows that studying of different social disciplines in Russian presents a number of difficulties. They are caused not only by the complexity of categorical and conceptual apparatus inherent in scientific language, but also arise from the lack of foreign students' communication skills and abilities. This explains the need to create materials on the language of the specialty within Russian as a foreign language course. The article discusses the methods and techniques that will prepare foreigners for being taught in higher education human sciences programs in Russian: sociology, political science, economics, psychology, and others. To this end, the authors of the article offer various systems of exercises aimed at developing of professional communication skills.

AB The questions of how successfully the youth of the second half of the 1950s the first half of the 1960s formed a focus on the value of knowledge and what role the Young Communist League (Komsomol) played in this are considered. Studying the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League from the standpoint of state, the authors came to the conclusion that this kind of "Ministry of Youth" not only served as an institution of political socialization, but also persistently showed concern for the education of youth. The basic directions of activity of the Komsomol to achieve the goals of universal education (universal education) are revealed. The achievements in the popularization of science and technology among young people are shown. To assess the perception of the youth of the USSR of knowledge as a value, the authors widely use the results of mass surveys published in the 1960s in the "Komsomolskaya Pravda." It is noted that the most important indicator of the prestige of knowledge is the high level of popularity of self-education. It is especially emphasized that during this period the organizers of youth leisure in any case did not forget about educational tasks. The novelty of the study is that the materials of the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History, as well as previously stored under the heading of "top secret" documents of collections for official use have been introduced into scientific circulation.

AB The paper studies the peculiarities of the establishment of the Soviet power in Chechnya. Its chronology covers the period from 1920 to 1924. With the end of the civil war, it was natural that in the first place the competent governing bodies had to be established. There was a complex problem, since the revolution system of the state regulation had formed under specific conditions. First, there was post-war time; second, the concerned territory was one of the most deficient-in terms of almost all aspects-peripheries of the former Tsarist Russia. The leaders of the Bolsheviks were orienting their commissaries to take into account the combination of the factors following from these circumstances. The subject of the study lies in the discovery of the main regularities of establishment and development of the Soviet power in national regions of Russia (in Chechnya). The political system of Soviet Chechnya was formed in hard conditions. It was the period when the elections for local Soviets were run in Chechnya; and the transition from emergency government to elected one was made. Such processes of Soviet building indicate a gradual solution of the problems connected with the strengthening of local Soviet authorities and extensive involvement of highlanders into their formation and operation.

DE Siberia; Far East; Western historiography; exile; penal labor
AB The aim of research is to analyze key works of Anglo-American and German scholars dealing with the pre-revolutionary history of exile and penal labor in Siberia and Russian Far East, and to determine these authors'' contribution to the study of the topic. It is established that Western historians pay considerable attention to the period of the second half of the XIX - early XX centuries, when Siberia's penitentiary system underwent a crisis and subsequent reforms initiated by the government. In the West since the time when G.Kennan's works were published Siberia has been viewed mostly as a region settled and colonized by exiles and penal labourers. Despite the heightened public interest in these issues there were few special works written by professional Western historians. As a rule until the late 1970s in the English-language scholarship some aspects of the topic were addressed either in comprehensive studies (T. Armstrong etc.) or in biographical works devoted to the well-known figures of revolutionary movement (E. Carr, F.B. Randall etc.). In the 1980s-early 1990s the British historian Alan Wood was the only representative of English-language historiography who focused in his studies on the history of Siberian exile. The contemporary Anglo-American and German historiography is marked by the growing interest of researchers in the stated topic, as is evidenced by dissertations, articles and monographs written by A. Gentes, Ph. Desind, K. Turton, A. Schrader, S. Badcock, D. Beer, Sh. Corrado, D. Dahlmann et al. It is concluded that Western scholars contribute significantly to the study of problems related to the penitentiary system of pre-revolutionary Siberia and Far East. Actively working in Russian archives they expand the range of historical sources available for further studies. Using the theoretical and methodological tools of "the new social and cultural history" (including such interdisciplinary research fields as "historical penology", gender studies etc.) the Anglo-American and German scholars attempt at revising established concepts and offer their own interpretations and evaluations of the state policy in enforcement of sentences; trace changing public perceptions of exile and penal labor; characterize distinctive features of application of punishment and status of various categories of exiles in Siberia. What brings Western researchers closer to the Russian historiography is their heightened interest in historical-legal issues, history of criminal exile and penal labor as well as their desire to show the inseparable links of these penitentiary institutions with processes of social-political, socio-cultural and economic development of Asiatic Russia.

ID RIGHTS; SPACE
AB This study examines playgrounds as lenses on urban transitions to explain the link between urban transformations and changes in the discourse of play and childhood. Specifically, it compares Soviet public playgrounds and post-Soviet privatized playscapes in the city of Yekaterinburg, Russia, through primary observation and secondary data analysis. Using the framework of social reproduction developed by Cindy Katz and Saskia Sassen to explain how the local forces affect cities, my analysis shows that the shift in the discourse of play and childhood in the post-Soviet period is hinged on global influences combined with local transformations, from the abandonment of Soviet ideals of communal play spaces to the embracement of today's consumerist play places. Whereas the old Soviet playgrounds have uncertain purposes, in contemporary Yekaterinburg private playgrounds offer a narrative of play in terms of leisure, love, and convenience for parents. Children turn into consumers of private play, leaving most of the Soviet playgrounds as idle spaces in the city. This article argues that Yekaterinburg's shift toward participating in the globalized economy combined with its transition from the Soviet ideals maintains social relations and reproduces social inequalities in childhood, as this condition favors consumerist narratives of play. I conclude that the playgrounds in Yekaterinburg are bystanders of new global ecologies whereby social, political, and economic transformations become an impetus to reproduce new ways of seeing the social importance and meaning of play and playgrounds.

DE Neo-Nazism; nationalism; racism; "Comradeship"; "Autonomous
   Nationalists"; Germany
AB This article is devoted to the problem of neo-Nazism in modern Germany. The purpose of the publication was a comprehensive study of this issue on the example of neo-Nazi groups - "Comradeship" and "Autonomous Nationalists". The activity of neo-Nazis, the dissemination of their views in society, the involvement of young people in their ranks are closely linked with the activities of these groups of the neo-Nazi camps of the Federal Republic of Germany. These groups are an integral part of the neo -Nazi movement that exists within the framework of the right camp as a whole.
   The author demonstrated the relevance of the topic, a number of definitions of neo-Nazism and its representatives from the official bodies and science, briefly reviewed the history, roots of ideological attitudes, and also highlighted the features of the youth group of the so-called "Autonomous Nationalists". The points of view in the science of the causes and factors affecting the manifestation of the activity of right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis were considered.
   It was found that the groups considered in the article are an integral part of neo-Nazism. These neo-Nazi forces are united by a commitment to the ideology of National Socialism. A different form of its distribution is the boundary between these groups. One group is in the camp of the so-called "traditional" extremists, the other in the revolutionary youth camp. At the same time, the second of them is the most aggressive and uncontrollable by the standards of the neo-Nazis themselves. The impact on the activity of neo-Nazism and right-wing extremism, in general, is due to various reasons and factors: from the next influx of migrants and refugees to the sociocultural problems associated with the process of their integration.
   The question of the existence of the threat of neo-Nazism for society in modern Germany is highly relevant today. At the federal level of countries, there are various neo-Nazi groups that preach their ideas among young people using a variety of methods: from propagating their ideas through song lyrics at musical concerts and on the Internet, to grafting them on the spot during rallies and demonstrations. However, their work is not limited to pure propaganda Every year, crimes are committed against refugees and migrants on racial basis. Very often in the news, there are reports of attacks on migrants and arson of their homes. At the same time, lawsuits against the most odious representatives of neo-Nazism as the National Socialist underground can last for years. The promotion to the parliament of such a right-wing party as "Alternative for Germany" serves as a signal that a crisis of trust in the authorities is growing in German society. But at the same time, being an indisputable threat to the liberal, democratic society of Germany, neo-Nazis, like right-wing extremism as a whole, are marginalized by the country's political life, having no mass base to secure the necessary breakthrough in elections. The ground for this is objective historical reasons.

AB The authors present the concept of alphabetical construction in Yakutia during the Soviet modernization. It is emphasized that the Yakut region as a special historical and cultural space was characterized by the intensity of civilizational dialogue and exchange of ideas, political strategies and practices. The authors note that the socialist reconstruction actualized the "linguistic" turn in the intellectual environment of the Yakut ASSR in the 1920s-1930s. Two principal positions are characterized in the ongoing heated debate about the graphics of the Yakut alphabet (Cyrillic, on which N. N. Poppe, E. K. Pekarskiy, A. E. Kulakovskiy and V. N. Leontyev insisted, and Latinized, advocated by A. N. Samoylovich, B. M. Grande, S. A. Novgorodov, P. A. Oyunsky). Special attention is paid to the linguistic project developed by the linguist G. V. Baishev (Altan Saryn), which echoes the ideas of linguistic pan-Turkism. For the first time P. A. Oyunsky's scientific activity in the years of postgraduate study in Moscow (1932-1935), where he was in the "ideological" circle of outstanding linguists, is analysed. It is shown that the worldview and practice of the national intelligentsia were concentrated on experiments on alphabetical construction. The novelty of the research is seen in the methodological innovation: the combination of approaches of transnational and intellectual history allowed to reveal the importance of the presented language projects in the framework of political discourse.

AB The political culture of any society is supported and determined by the spiritual and moral values adopted by this particular society over the course of its historical development. We can say that general cultural values of the metaphysical order eventually transformed into socio-political values that formed the modern heterogeneous political space. The transmission of values, including political ones, takes place by means of exploiting different mechanisms by society and using different tools. Nevertheless, one of the most effective mechanisms at this time is education, which is more and more often considered by developed countries as a means of achieving their economic and political dominance in the international arena. In this aspect, education serves as a tool of "soft power" policy. It is through the expansion and spread of their education model that many countries promote their political values in economically and geopolitically important regions.

AB The article is devoted to the topical question of the linguo-didactic value of small-format news media texts and the peculiarities of their introduction into the foreign language teaching practice based on the MOODLE (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) educational platform.
   The relevance of the study is due to the fact that in the era of the global information space, the media sphere of language functioning is one of the most active language zones. In addition, the development of the Internet space has greatly facilitated access to various media materials. It is these features of modern communication that collectively contribute to the fact that media texts are gradually becoming one of the main resources in teaching foreign languages and, in particular, Russian as a foreign language.
   The article reflects the methodological base of both the Russian and European traditions of foreign language teaching.
   Research methodology includes an analysis of academic literature on foreign language teaching methods, pedagogy, psychology and linguistics as part of the problem under study, as well as a methodological analysis of the existing practice of using digital technologies in teaching foreign languages.
   Small-format texts of the "news flow" related to the basic texts of the media sphere are the object of this research. The study highlights the following characteristics of the small-format news text: authenticity, accessibility, relevance, thematic diversity, linguo-cultural value.
   The aim of the study is to identify the structural and linguistic properties of small-format news media texts, the features of their functioning in the digital environment, due to the multimodal nature. These features allow us to consider these texts as a linguo-didactic resource. The ability to work with foreign-language media content is becoming of particular importance at universities which specify in the training of specialists in various fields of international relations, political science, international economics, international law, and management.
   Small-format news texts of news agencies and text materials of television news programs served as the material of the study.
   The results of the study propose criteria for the selection of news media texts for educational purposes and specific recommendations on their use in the practice of foreign language teaching with the help of digital technologies. In particular, they suggest forms of using this type of text in the format of distance and blended learning. In addition, the study presents the stages of the formation of various components of communicative competence based on the analysis of the experience of conducting lessons of Russian as a foreign language at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (University) (MGIMO University)).

AB This article discusses the peculiarities of modern migration processes taking place in the social structure of one of the subjects of the Russian Federation of the North Caucasus Federal District (NCFD) - the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania (RNO-A). The complex socio-economic, political, ethno-social and confessional processes cause a lot of objective and subjective characteristics of the migration changes in the given region, which cannot but influence the public opinion and attitude towards the migrants. The article discusses both quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the modern migration processes in the territory of the RNO-Alania and presents the results of the empirical research of this issue. The subject of the research is the current migration situation in the territory of one of the subjects of the Russian Federation, the North Caucasus Federal District - the RNO-A, namely, its determination, content, subjecting, forms of inclusion in the social structures of the region. The aim of the work is a comprehensive study of the migration trend to the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania in the context of several research paradigms - political, governmental, ethno-political, socio-structural, and social-mental.

AB In the current economic situation, at a time of limited resources and opportunities, as well as the number and severity of unresolved social and economic problems, the possibility of using the theory of "growth poles" is increasingly relevant. "Growth poles" ("points of economic growth") are agglomerations of enterprises, productions concentrated territorially and allocated by intensive innovative processes. Determination of the most perspective branches of development of regions, levels of development of branches promote increase of efficiency of strategic planning of the region, and also specific orientation of investment activity within area. Due to the limited budget, it is necessary to determine the unstable sectors of the region, as well as the development prospects characteristic of the region, for the implementation of support and regulation. The relevance of the topic is due to the fact that the formation and effective functioning of "points of growth" is increasingly approved as one of the key instruments of regional development policy, as well as the development of individual territories. The increase in the effectiveness of the measures proposed by the government, as well as the formation of an effective investment policy contributes to a clear definition of the main promising sectors of the regions, i.e. the "growth poles" of the regions. Determining the goal of creating a pole of competitiveness is the key to its further effective development. The pole of competitiveness is aimed not only at the development of enterprises and companies included in it, but also at the comprehensive development of the territory in which it is located. Clearly defined boundaries of creating a pole of competitiveness allow us to determine the structures that will control its activities. Lack of control often leads to inappropriate and inefficient public financing and hinders the development of the competitiveness pole. In the work considered two methods for determining the major growth poles: the first approach is based on the basis of determining the competitiveness of industries, the second approach is characterized by the determination of the structural elasticity of production in the region. Main results: the concept of "growth poles" for the region is characterized, as well as the algorithm for determining the promising growth poles is considered, the main promising industries are identified, as well as the level of development of each of the industries at the present time, the model of unique competencies of the region is presented, which will allow to identify interregional poles of competitiveness growth and develop strategies for spatial development of the region. The main methods used in writing the work are: comparative analysis, monitoring, historical and political science, the method of constructing scenarios, correlation and regression analysis.

AB The actively forming system of Eurasian international relations is a non-linear synergetic process of free choice of political ideals, meaning-determining attitudes of development, models of future behavior of interested states. The most important prerequisite for preventing any unexpected crisis seems to be the consistent formation of the most effective mechanisms of mutual rational control over the instinctive impulses of unilateral "expansion" of the two countries in the geostrategic inter-civiliza (Tonal area of Eurasia. International experts recommend that Russia and China should be extremely careful and attentive in the formation of a common Eurasian space in order to avoid suspicion of neighbors in the desire of China and Russia to political domination. The core problem of the Russian-Chinese partnership in the foreseeable future is likely to be a tough agreement on continental Eurasian self-organization, designed to balance the ambitions of Moscow and Beijing in order to protect the integration process from slipping into the abyss of mutual reproaches. If this succeeds, then it will be possible to allow a greater probability of the formation of a Russian-Chinese multi-vector Alliance. In long-term geopolitical plans of two great. powers Eurasia take an important place in the context of building stable security area in remote perspective. It seems that great civilizations like Russia and China, so as India, Iran and Turkey, in visible future will inevitably set to the joint elaboration of values system which most probably in many aspects may not coincide with the postmodern paradigm of "collective West" development.
   The international experts recommend the RE and China to be extremely careful and attentive in forniation of the united Eurasian space in order to not arise any suspicion about alleged aspiration of the PRC and Russia to dominate politically. Evidently, real pivotal problem for China-Russia partnership in visible perspective will consist in the achievement of tough agreement on their self-organization in continental Eurasia aimed to balance ambitions of Moscow and Beijing and preserve integration process from slipping down to the abyss of mutual reproaches. If that succeeds, there will appear probability of formatting Russia-China multifaceted alliance. Complexity in functioning of Russia-China partnership is that will be able to arise the occurrences when both sides relations can pour periods of crises and Eurasia as a geopolitical space in virtue of its civilization variety show itself incapable to find common acceptable decision of regional importance questions and that impel Russia and China to doubt in rightness of jointly chosen political course.
   Unlike Russia and China, the USA absolutely do not understand the enormous importance of traditional values that help shape new realities on the Eurasian continent, when all countries in the region consistently seek ways to neutralize existing ideological differences. In that connection it is very important to give a meaning of question about Eurasia continent civilization's frontiers which remain greatly conventional and interpreted absolutely in different way on East and West that can politically look like tough competition of conceptions concerning multi-polarity and globalization. On that background there are two different in principal models of future universe, namely: one polar world and many poles world every of which inherent characteristics of inimitability and humiliation.
   Nowadays there is accumulated process when many Eurasian states refuse from political patronage of Washington and that lead them toward a search of other possibilities for realization own national interests on international arena. The main doubts in constmctivism of political changes on Eurasia continent have been tied with the apprehensions of sonic countries toward real stability of developed after the World War II system especially concerning financial regulation and trade-economic interac- Lion in frames of WTO pouring serious crises. Formation of financial existence new picture on Eurasian continent is accompanied by the growth of political instability not only in regional but in global scale. Moreover it's turned out absolute demands to human activity Which can he called a certain ecological imperative. This imperative has objectively to limit a freedom of human-being's economic actions so that to secure new conditions for further co-evolution of human-being and biosphere, in which financial factor already will not play main role.

AB Introduction. The subject of this work is the ethno-demographic structure and public opinion of the Terek Cossacks during the period of the NEP "extending". The purpose of the article is to determine the peculiarities of changes in the ethnodemographic structure and public opinion of the Terek Cossacks in the context of "extending" the new economic policy (autumn 1924-1926). Methods and materials. The research methodology includes social constructivism as applied to interpreting the Cossacks' ethnicity. The paper uses the synchronous and diachronic comparative analysis of political orientations of Cossack property layers; a variation series was built on the materials of the All-Union Census of 1926 to identify the total number of the Terek Cossacks and its ethnic identity. Analysis and results. The policy of party-Soviet authorities on "extending" the NEP was carried out on the Terek in part, which was explained by interethnic and land conflicts in the region, the Terek's border strategic location. This conclusion relates to the scale of the amnesty of white movement participants, "revitalization" of local Soviets, easing of policies towards well-off layers of the Cossacks, and their public associations. The response of Terek Cossacks manifested in public opinion developed from the initial hope for democratic elections of councils, cooperatives, land societies (autumn 1924 - spring 1925) to disappointment in inconsistent reforms, to Cossacks' attempts to seize local governments (elections of 1926). The article also proves the predominance of Russian ethnic identity among Terek Cossacks, establishes the territorial structure of their residence area (based on the census of 1926). The author proves the direct proportional relationship between the level of urbanization of the Cossacks living in multiethnic local communities and the choice of Russian identity.

AB Among the current problems developed by the leading Russian and international research centers, search of models of sustainable development of the modern multinational state has the greatest scientific and practical importance. The set of researches in various spheres of the humanities which consider it in a politological, historical and sociocultural foreshortening in various chronological intervals is devoted to a phenomenon of formation of imperial identity. Progress in studying of an imperial perspective is promoted by innovative methodological approaches and implementation of cross-disciplinary cooperation - holding the international conferences and seminars, grant cooperation, the publication of results of researches in the international scientific magazines. An object of research are the historical researches devoted to features of formation of ethnic identity in the territory of the Southeast of the European Russia including the South of Central Volga area, Lower Volga area, East and Southern Cisural area. In the present article the purpose to consider the latest literature on an imperial perspective, to note effectiveness research the practician of regional historians and to try to define a vector of further researches is set. The historiographic facts which were published as a result of implementation of programs of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, and grants of the international and Russian funds act as istochnikovy base. Authors, having analysed, achievements of modern Russian and foreign historians in the field of studying ethnosocial, religious, come to a conclusion about prospects of cross-disciplinary researches with use of theories of acculturation, ethnopsychology, orientalism and the multiple-factor analysis. The tasks demanding further studying among which there is a studying of the general and special in formation of imperial identity, responses of "the national outskirts" to the policy of the Russian state, a ratio of national and nation-wide interests, ethnic and social are set. Demand additional studying the questions connected with studying of specifics of political, social and ideological transit of imperial ideology.

AB The article reviews techniques and methods for solving the "women's question" in Soviet Russia in the 1920s-30s. The declared "women's equality" was in fact a double burden on the shoulders of female workers. To help the "new woman" to combine her family responsibilities and factory work, the Soviet state took a number of steps for facilitating her life. Public canteens, factory-kitchens, laundries, tailor shops, and preschool institutions were to liberate the woman from "kitchen slavery" and give her an opportunity to devote herself to production. The declared social equality in practice meant utmost simplification of family life. Of equal importance in creating the "new woman" image were sports events and physical education, much promoted by the Soviet state as a recreation and a means of managed formation of the "new woman." Calling women to take an active part in the festivities contributed to their assimilation of social and political attitudes, to the formation of a new system of political values, to the sustention of approved behavior. A case-study of visual propaganda and propaganda during mass games, physical culture parades, and demonstrations on the public holidays highlights the Soviet authorities' efforts to create an image of the "new woman." The sources include the 1920s-30s propaganda materials: published and unpublished journalistic writings of Soviet statemen, instructional guidelines and scenarios for public holidays, as well as publications in the 1920s-30s media, all of which demonstrated the ideal of the Soviet woman, which real women tried to imitate on weekdays, as well as on holidays. The article examines how this new identity - woman who succeeded at the factory and in everyday life - was formed by means of organized mass games, demonstrations, and festivities.

AB Based on a simple mathematical model, the coefficient of susceptibility to extremist ideology of the youth of the Republic of Dagestan at the beginning of the 21st century is estimated. The explanation of high values of this coefficient in 2006-2011 is proposed. The level of tension in Dagestan, measured by the change in normalized indicators, is shown: the number of murders and attempted murders, the number of suicides and the difference in divorce rates and marriages began to grow later than terrorist activity and was not the cause, but the consequence of increased terror. The analysis of statistical data shows that the attractiveness of extremism in Dagestan during this period cannot be associated with the deterioration in the standard of living. The possible impact of ousting of terrorist groups from Chechnya on terrorist activities in Dagestan is being analyzed. According to available data, such effect took place, though was insignificant. It is hypothesized that the main reason for the increase in extremist activity in the period under review was the maturing of the generation whose religion was the basis of the world outlook. Radical trends in Islam, which effectively used social exclusion, political inactivity and theoretical weakness of official Islam in the face of growing social and economic inequality, had a significant impact on formation of youth in this period. A certain role was played by accelerated urbanization and tough force, carried out not only in relation to ultra-radicals connected to terrorist groups, but also to moderate radicals.

AB The publication discusses the incorporation of the Mongolian political elite into the imperial administrative structure of the Qing state. The foundations of the ethnonational policy of the Manchu dynasty and the place of Mongolia in it are analyzed. The special status of the external vassal of northern Mongolia was due to the strategic importance and military-political significance of the region both in the initial period of the formation of the Manchu state and in the subsequent stages of the territorial expansion of the Qing Empire. It is shown that the system of management of the region was built on the hierarchy of the military-administrative organization of the population of Mongolia with the integration of the clan aristocracy into the bureaucratic apparatus of the Qing Empire.

   The authors examine the role and place of Islam in international development and global governance in the context of pressing issues of inter-civilizational and inter-confessional interaction in the modern world, the challenges and threats that arise, including the problems of combating extremism and international terrorism. The authors focus on a comprehensive assessment and forecast of the development of the "Muslim segment" of the modern polycentric world, the conflict between the spatial expansion of traditional Islam and the neo-liberal world order, the "Arab spring" phenomenon, mass management technologies from various political forces, the danger of regional destabilization and threats to global security and the interests of Russia.

AB Soviet cultural diplomacy drew significant attention of Western researchers from various fields, who tried to properly interpret the cultural expansion of the Soviet Union. The initial political approach to perception of cultural diplomacy as a form of competition and the struggle of superpowers for greater influence still retains its position in contemporary historiography, yet the institutional level of research dedicated to the mechanisms of authoritarian political systems finally gives us a chance to study the inner logic of the functioning of the Soviet bureaucratic system. The collective monograph edited by Oksana Nagornaya provides a detailed description of the institutions responsible for Soviet cultural diplomacy in the 1950s-1980s, as well as its practical aims and goals. The authors' refusal to use the traditional political timeframes of the post-war USSR associated with political leaders made it possible to state that the dominant impulses for developing and transforming Soviet cultural diplomacy were in fact the two great crises in the Socialist block in 1956 and 1968. In the aftermath of the Hungarian crisis, a radical turn took place in the Soviet system, with a new focus on creating systems of mass communication in the fields of interstate, academic and social relations. An important part of such policy change was ecclesiastic diplomacy of the Soviet Union, which previously had been outside the traditional framework because of the Bolsheviks' negative view on religion. This form of diplomacy began to rapidly develop in the 1960s-1980s, turning church representatives into important actors of the Cold War. The expanding system of communication, growing more and more complex, led to unexpected transformations and privatization of discourses and narratives translated abroad or offered to foreign tourists, gradually changing the inner cultural landscape of the USSR.

AB The presented article deals with ideological and stylistic interrelations of Weimar art of the early 1920s with Italian metaphysical painting. The author examines in details the texts and manifestos of Italian and German artists, revealing the general theoretical views on the art of both sides. The author focuses on the image of the "new man" in German art, which originated in the context of expressionism, and received a different expression and meaning in the early 1920s. With the help of stylistic principles of pittura metafisica, as well as its main character - dummy - German artists have come up with their own version of the "new man". Berlin Dadaists and the representatives of the new objectivity leave behind the metaphysical meaning, that originally laid down in C. Carra's and G. de Chirico's mannequins, and put the "new man" in Weimar socio-political realities, thus creating an art of highly topicality.

TI BRICS Countries in Political Consciousness of Russian Citizens
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

DT Article
DE BRICS; political consciousness; political perception; stereotypes; image
   of the country; implicit factors of perception; emotional profile of
   perception
ID LEADERS; IMAGES
AB The article analyzes the Russian citizens' perceptions of BRICS countries. The authors focus on the cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and symbolic aspects characterizing BRICS countries in political consciousness of the Russians as well as common stereotypes, intentions, and associations. Since the Russian Federation has political and economic interests in cooperation with the BRICS countries, it is important to study representations of Brazil, India, China and South Africa in Russian consciousness and identify the possibilities of their transformation.
   Proceeding from the results of qualitative politico-sociological (a series of focused interviews) and politico-psychological (projective tests) studies held in 2016-2018 the authors conclude that the emotional component prevails in the structure of Russian citizens' perception about of Brazil, India, China and South Africa. The image of China appears to be the most complicated and multidimensional, with the key elements being the "thousand-year history", the "great culture" and the recognition of the geopolitical power of this state. The images of India and Brazil among the Russians have a significantly more amorphous character, but at the same time hold a moderately positive emotional connotation. The image of South Africa is the most fragmented, devoid of stable emotional valence and bright associations.
   It is remarkable that the perception of the BRICS countries by the majority of respondents is primarily influenced by implicit factors which manifest in appeal to stereotypes and associations (India - cinema, Brazil - football, etc.). Dynamic factors, determined by political agenda, play a minor role forming the images of the BRICS countries. A noticeable feature of their representation among the Russians is the blurring of the "image of due" and "image of the future", as well as the minimal role of the political component (with exception of China). Therefore, it is necessary to change the information policy for the countries studied. In order to enhance the understanding of significance and relevance of cooperation with the BRICS states among the Russian citizens, it seems to be necessary 1) to build a positive image of political relations with them; 2) to cement an image of a "partner" and an "ally" in mass media, both on a rational and an unconscious level of political perception.

AB The book by George Gallup "The Pulse of Democracy: The Public-Opinion Poll and How It Works" was published in Russia more than 70 years after it was first published on the eve of World War II. This timing was the reason why Gallup paid so much attention to how the problems of war were reflected in public opinion and how this opinion was taken into account in making political decisions. The main subject for Gallup, however, was always elections. War and elections are the two extremes which affect public opinion most of all. When both follow one shortly after the other they test the durability of democracy - a test which not every state can withstand. In Russia, the presidential elections of 2000 took place against the background of the 'second Chechen war', and it may have helped Vladimir Putin defeat Evgeny Primakov in the 'intra-elite primaries'.
   The problem of the accuracy of election forecasts remains a lively issue. Gallup criticized multimillion person polls, conducted by the press, the goal of which were to maintain communication with readers. The case of contemporary Russian media exemplifies that such methods are still in demand. For Gallup, opinion polls were true in the last instance, their reliability was often even more accurate than the results of the election. Gallup asks many fundamental questions about bridging the gap between the people and decision-makers, the usefulness of public opinion for democracy, the manipulative nature of some polls, and about referendums using sampling. All of these questions remain highly relevant in Russia, and the answers are desperately needed.

At the present time this topic also remains relevant and carries a noticeable element of discussion. The article provides an insight into the development of the Polish government policy of the Russian Empire and the influence of the Duma factions on it in the context of the foreign policy situation on the eve of the World War I. The feeling of the approaching conflict with Germany and Austria-Hungary and the active discussion of the issue in the State Duma made the Polish question particularly important for Russia in this period of time. The authors presented an analysis of the measures undertaken by the tsarist authorities towards Poland and the recommendations of authoritative Russian political parties on the Polish question.

AB The welfare state is an object with a constitutional status, and as such is a subject to theoretical analysis. At the same time, this is an object that interacts in real time with society, with the country's population, and has certain obligations to them. Therefore, an analysis of the actual implementation by a social state of its immanent functions is necessary to understand its role in the life of modem society. The obligations of the social state are diverse, but among them there are those that have an undeniable priority. Development of a strong social state in Russia is a pressing social and political issue that will determine the civilization security of the country and the life quality of its nation. The social state focuses on employment, healthcare, education, social welfare of vulnerable social groups (retired, disabled, unemployed people), gender relations, etc. In order to function as a strong social state, there has to be an economic foundation that must be formed in a social market economy based on the principles of fair redistribution and competition. The central tasks facing the social state in Russia today are overcoming poverty and reducing social distances. These are the tasks that cannot be dealt with so far. According to an international comparative study (ESS), Russia is among those European countries where the population considers the state responsible for income equalization, protection of vulnerable social groups, and reduction of social distance in the society.

E. Tsiolkovsky, on October 8-11, 2019. Conference was jointly organized with the Institute of World History, Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian historical society, the Fund "History of the Fatherland" and Kaluga Region Government. The conference was attended by more than 100 Russian and foreign scholars, historians from Sweden, France, Belarus, Germany, Poland, Donetsk, as well as representatives of leading scientific centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Yekaterinburg, Rostov-on-Don, Volgograd, Samara, Smolensk, Oryol, Tula, Belgorod, Vologda, and Petrozavodsk. Several similar "challenges of time" that faced different states in Western, Central and Eastern Europe in Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Period were in the focus of discussion during the conference. Among them were threats from abroad and changes in foreign policy, "military revolution" and religious conflicts. During this period the conditions of the development in these regions are comparable and there were constant relations and interaction between different countries. It provides opportunities for the use of simultaneous study in the research of radical changes of that time. This approach let the participants of the conference to unveil several important tendencies in the rise of centralised states, development of the political institutions, transformations in urban administration and economy, changes in relations of the state and the church as well as in the social processes, typical for the period.

AB The historiographic image of Novgorod Hanseatic Kontor (German Yard) after its restoration in 1514 with descriptions of his decline was reconstructed mainly according to the testimony of the citizens of Revel aimed at preserving it. On the one hand, his skillfully designed Revel's discourse is objective because it reflects some crisis moments caused by the complication of Novgorod-Hanseatic business relations as a result of, firstly, the decline in discipline of the inhabitants of the German Yard, among which young people began to prevail, and, secondly, of differences in understanding of legal foundations of the RussoHanseatic trade, "antiquity" ("starina") by the Russian and Hanseatic sides in conditions of politicization of international trade in Russia. On the other hand, many historical realities in the framework of the revelation perception are distorted in favor of Revel's trading strategy. These are the themes of the poverty of the Yard, the possibility of its transition to "alien nations" and the escalation of Russian trade expansion in Western Europe. Its were used by the Revalers to provide assistance to Lubeck and to other Vendish towns in restoring and maintaining the German Yard. Of particular importance was financial support in the form of deductions from the "pound duty", puntzoll. The revelation descriptions of the riots on the German Yard were to create an idea among the Vendish towns of the insolvency of his administration, appointed by Dorpat, and help Revel take control of the compound in his hands. Revel also tried to prevent Danzig and other towns of Royal Prussia from accessing the German Yard. As a result of his policy, slipway trade in Novgorod gradually closed on Reval with the participation of Lubeck, who invariably supported the idea of preserving the Novgorod Hanseatic Kontor on the Hansetagen. Revel's desire to strengthen its position in Novgorod, presumably, was associated with the spread of credit operations in the Novgorod-Hanseatic trade, its kind of "monetization" associated with using of silver as a means of payment, and the transformation of Novgorod into a silver concentration center (Geldstelle).

DE Subjectivity of a person; mental aspects; cognitive science; cognitive
   paradigm
AB A person as an independent individual and as a member of a social group is an object of investigation of multiple sciences. In recent decades, a number of interdisciplinary fields of knowledge have been developed, which, by adapting the methodology of various sciences, make an attempt to deepen the knowledge about a person as a physical, spiritual, psychological, economic, political, and social being in general. Philosophical understanding of a person as a social being in the research process cannot be productive in isolation from social reality, which has its own structure. One of the most important structural elements of social reality is social space and social time, the dialectical interaction of which constructs a particular cultural-historical continuum. A person becomes the subject of this continuum in cognitive process, the content of which is determined by individual experience, social environment, and genetic potential. Human subjectivity is a unique form of expression of human self, the productive study of which requires the return of a subject of analysis to a certain space-time continuum in which the history of a subject (individual or social community) proceeded. This proposition is recognized.
   The main thesis of the authors is that the subjectivity of a person as a biopsychosocial being is formed in a constant decision-making process. The novelty of our approach in the framework of the above mentioned aspect is the explication of mental peculiarities of decision making in the newest paradigm of cognitive sciences.

AB The article presents an analysis of studies of various aspects of the history of the Russian cooperative movement in the late XIX - early XX centuries, performed by domestic historians in the 2000s. For this period, according to incomplete data, more than 500 works have been published that reveal at the national and regional levels the reasons for the emergence of various types of cooperative organizations, the stages of development and institutional formation of the cooperative movement, its role in the economic, socio-political and socio-cultural development of the country. Based on the study of scientific publications of various genres, which generally allow to determine the problematic thematic field of research, it makes conclusions about the key approaches and directions of modern work on the history of Russian cooperation, identifies the factors that determined the regional specifics of the cooperative movement in pre-revolutionary Russia that is economic, social, ethnic. A review of publications, including those made on regional documentary material, shows that the historiographic interpretation of the historical experience of Russian cooperation through the prism of its regional specificity allows not only to create a more complete picture of the development of cooperation during its highest rise, but also to identify promising research topics that are relevant for historical science and of practical significance for the stable development of modern Russia.

AB The conventional wisdom holds that a free, independent and pluralistic media environment is a necessary condition for the development of democracy. However, what are criteria for media freedom and its measurement tools, and how reliable are the findings obtained with their help?
   There are many methods for assessing the degree of media freedom - sociological surveys, expert interviews, analysis of legal acts, etc. However, the most popular method today is the indexing method, which implies studying the dynamics of processes using a set of generalized indicators. The most famous international media freedom indices are the following three: the Freedom House "Freedom of the Press" project, the Media Sustainability Index of the International Research and Exchanges Board and the Worldwide Press Freedom Index, compiled by the non-profit organization Reporters without Borders. These indices attract the attention not only of the professional and expert communities, but also the media that actively publish their results. Thus, the discussion of these results goes far beyond the academic community, and the indices themselves play an important role in public debates about the quality of democracy and freedom of expression.
   This article is devoted to the analysis of the mentioned indices and the methodology for their composition. Its main task is to find out to what extent these indices reflect the formal and informal aspects of media freedom and to what extent, if any, the indicators used for compiling such indices allow to assess the level of this freedom and trace its evolution in different countries.

DT Article
DE nation-building; Yakuts; ethno-confessional politics; nationalism;
   autonomy; USSR; Yakut ASSR
AB This article provides one of the first studies of nation-building in Yakutia from 1922 to the end of the 1930s. The largest ethnic community in this region became the subject of a global process of activating national movements at the site of disintegrated multinational empires of Europe and Asia under the influence of the First World War and subsequent revolutions. This political and cultural project involved both the central authorities of the RSFSR and the USSR, as well as the leadership of the Yakut ASSR, established in 1922. The existing preconditions for the formation of a Yakut nation (commonality of historical destiny, unity of language, existence of a national intelligentsia, etc.) and the political struggle between supporters of centralization and federalism forced the creation of necessary national attributes (autonomy, written national literature, national modernized culture and economy). There were some clear successes achieved by national policies, taking into account local peculiarities (e.g. temporary reconciliation and cooperation with non-partisan intelligentsia, tolerance for believers, most of whom were Yakuts, and creation of mass written language). At the same time, they were hindered by haste in modernizing and raising the cultural level of the Yakut population (spasmodic economic transformation, political ambitions by part of the Yakut intelligentsia not supported by objective conditions, thus encouraging indigenization) Yakutia's nation-building had two phases: phase 1 (1922 to the end of the 1920s), and phase 2 (late 1920s to the end of the 1930s), which corresponded to stages of prevalence of the national trend and the transition to non-national politics. Among the main results and lessons of nation-building were: truncated autonomy, but the experience of national government (successful experience of internal regionalization and defining the boundaries of the YASSR), defeat of the old national intelligentsia, creation of mass national writing, repression of religion and traditional beliefs, and raising the general cultural level).

LA Russian
DT Article
DE language territorial regime; language politics; language policy;
   Catalonia; electoral struggle; political parties; electoral programs
AB Language regime, based on a normative recognition of the co-official status of regional language, is needed in institutionally maintained public consensus. This consensus depends on a set of interlocking factors: the content and scope of language preferential policy, concerns and claims of political actors embroiled in language politics, and the changing political context. The article analyses the role of language policy as a topic in the electoral programs of the political parties of Catalonia in the context of the Barcelona Madrid conflict. It focuses on the electoral agenda and political parties' involvement in language politics. By a comparative analysis of party programs, we offer insights into the variability of language claims and their links with the position of parties in the conflict. The comparison indicates that the co-official status of Spanish Castilian and Catalan in regional linguistic space is not to be disputed. However, regional and national parties variously interpret and approve of this co-official " status. For regional branches of national parties, there is united support for Spanish Castilian and Catalan having equal status. Regional parties advocate the dominant position of Catalan, the next development of language preferential policy. They claim to improve Catalan as tool.for consolidation of community. Operational contestation of a language regime is in the rhetoric of Catalan Independentists. The status 7 of Catalan, and discussion about the content and scope of language preferential policy, plays a symbolic role in the conflict between Catalonia and Spain. The reinforcement of claims of Independentists to re-evaluate the parity of Catalan and Spanish Castilian acts as an instrument of ethnic mobilization.

DE Marxism; political economy; Western economic thought; post-Soviet period
AB The specifics of research in the history of Russian and Soviet economic thought in China is determined by the influences of ideology and politics. Chinese researchers are inter- ested in the development of Marxist and socialist economic thought in Russia, in the experience of borrowing and adapting Western economic theories, and in the discussions about unique features of Russian economic thought. Attention to the experience of the development of Russian economic thought can be explained by two reasons. First, economic science in Russia and China initially developed on the basis of traditional Marxist political economy. Second, as the borrowing of Western economic science expanded, both countries experienced the conflict between the paradigms of political economy and Western economics. "The New Edition of the History of Economic Thought" in 11 volumes published in China focuses only on Chinese, Western and Marxist economic thought. Russian economic ideas are presented in the book either as part of Marxism or of Western thought. Researchers prioritize the task of identifying the impact of Russian and Soviet economic theories upon the formation of Chinese economic thought. Russian publications about the "forgotten" economists of the Soviet period caused no significant research interest in China. Chinese knowledge about the developments of Russian post-Soviet economic science is fragmentary; its focus is shifted towards non-mainstream theories of Russian economists. Studies in Russian economic science are centered on the Soviet period or aimed at finding in contemporary material valuable lessons for the construction of "political economy of socialism with Chinese characteristics".

First of them by the early, 20th century was far from completion and the second was only in its incipient phase. So, revolution if understood as a "movement", as the challenge the society put before state powers and, correspondingly, essential change in their interrelations, did not take place in the North Caucasian ethno-social setting.

AB This article considers the evolution of the republican political project during the era of the First French Republic. The author refers to two speeches delivered in the National Convention which anticipated the discussion about the republican constitutions, i.e. the Constitution of 1793 and the Constitution of the Year III. Deputies who made these speeches (the former was delivered by M.-J. Herault de Sechelles and the latter by F.-A. Boissy d'Anglas) both were considered the authors, although not exclusively, of the constitutions, both spoke not in their own name, both had to formulate the main provisions of the political projects embodied in the constitutions. Analysis of these speeches demonstrates that over two years the understanding of the goals and objectives of the Republic, the perception of the French revolution, and the measure of the extent to which the texts of the constitutions should correspond to the ideas of the most authoritative enlighteners radically changed.
   While in 1793 the ideas related to the victory of the Revolution all over the world, the implementation of democratic principles to the fullest extent and the principle of popular sovereignty formulated by the enlighteners, seemed to be the most important, by 1795 these theoretical questions gave way to the experience of the previous years, parting with illusions, and the focus shifted to practical issues. The constitution was still regarded as a global document designed to harmonise all the spheres of people's lives, but the cosmopolitan ambitions and confidence in the enlighteners stayed in the past. The Revolution itself began to be perceived without rapture, without illusions, but as a long and difficult distance covered by the French people which was associated with many sacrifices and sufferings.

AB The article deals with the influence of the political development of Greece on the philosophy of peripatetics in the period of early Hellenism. The treatment of this issue in research literature is often underexplored and one-sided. It is believed that socio-historical changes in the era of Hellenism are most fully reflected in the philosophy of Epicurus, Stoics and Skeptics. It is noted that in the conditions of the formation of Hellenistic monarchies the dominant tendency in Greek philosophy was the alienation of the individual from society. In the course of the study, the author comes to the conclusion that the philosophy of peripatetics was influenced by two political systems that coexisted during the early Hellenic period. The first system was represented by Hellenistic monarchies. The second system was the traditional organization of city-states. As the author has established, with the formation of Hellenistic monarchies, the Lyceum saw a significant growth of interest in the monarchical state system. In their numerous writings on the tsarist government, peripatetics developed the idea of a virtuous and enlightened monarch. This idea was confirmed by the activities of certain Hellenistic rulers, such as Ptolemy I Soter, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, Seleucus I Nicator, Antigonus II Gonatas. The impact of the Greek polis that continued to exist during this period, manifested itself in peripatetic studies on the laws and government of Greek city states. In addition, the Lyceum continued to work on projects of the ideal state. The considerable interest of peripatetics in the problem of political stability, as well as their critical attitude to the main types of state structure - democracy and oligarchy - indicates the development of the crisis of the system of city-states in the period of early Hellenism. The philosophy of peripatetics also manifested two opposite tendencies. The trend of alienation of the individual from society was evident in Theophrastus, in the form of commitment to the avoidance of marriage, family and children, as well as ideas about the wise man who finds satisfaction in his loneliness. The tendency towards political activity is particularly evident in Dicaearchus and Demetrius of Phalerum, who placed active life above the life of contemplation. The interest in political science in the Lyceum and participation of its individual representatives in public affairs lead to the conclusion that for peripatetics in the period of early Hellenism the tendency to participate in political activity prevailed over the tendency towards the alienation of the individual from society.

AB The gradual disintegration of colonial empires caused by the growth of national movements and significant weakening of the metropolitan powers after the war became one of the important results of World War II. The process of separation of the colonies coincided with the genesis of a new global confrontation between the former allies in the Anti-Hitler coalition. The Cold War and the search for optimal relations with the closest ally of the USA - Great Britain - required new approaches and views on the decolonization process. At the same time, the ambitions of the White House, which on the one hand supported the disintegration of colonial empires, and on the other diligently tried to take the place of the former empires, led to a number of contradictions with the European states. The article is devoted to the issue of assessing the Suez Crisis in the US press. The whole complexity of perceiving the crisis was reflected in the press, which was trying to form an understanding of the new process in which America was involved. In the course of the difficult search for the optimal political way and view on the crisis, several polar points of view were formed in the American press. Thus, the study of the perception of the crisis by the largest American editions and the most noticeable journalists is essential for the understanding of how the society in the USA after 1956 gradually realized the place of the country in the new system of the international relations, looked for optimal ways of interaction both with the closest allies, and with a number of the new independent states. The article is based on the materials of both democratic, and republican editions of the US press.

AB Political marketing is a new way of thinking in the context of public diplomacy. With the development of globalization and the media revolution, each country has gained a better understanding of the image and reputation of the country, which is important in international life. Political scientists have to study more political marketing. They have to learn how to make better use of the management capacity of the country's image at the international level. International petroleum companies, including multinational petroleum companies, are taking more significant roles as international political and economic actors. Awareness of the impact of international petroleum companies in international relations should go beyond the traditional base of narrowly national theoretical paradigms. Our report examines the global petroleum system, the international petroleum companies, producers and consumers of petroleum. The important place in the creation of the brand of the country occupies industry brands. International petroleum companies, petroleum producing countries, and consumer countries must use political marketing because they have developed rich sources of energy, create material capital and technology. They are political and economic actors in the contemporary international system, the international financial system, international trade and international division of labor.

AB Axioms of natural law are revealed using principles of sustainable development of nature and society and taking into account the heterogeneity of the geographical environment reflected in landscape maps. In the axiomatic system, the environmental characteristics are not considered, and the laws are interpreted in a "pure" form as the laws of internal freedom of sustainable development of social systems. Axioms of natural law occur through the interpretation of the laws of the general systems theory in terms of the activity theory. The postulates of sustainable development determine the need to preserve nature, save sustained economic growth and maintain accelerated free development of society. In mathematics, the number of independent coordinates that completely determine the position of objects in space is called the number of freedom degrees. In this case, a high degree of freedom of life is a prerequisite for freedom in the socio-political and ethical terms as freedom of will in the local space of activity determined by the external environment. This is the geopolitical essence of landscape planning as well as legal zoning and territorial land-use policy where the same legal laws are manifested in different ways in different locations, taking into account local geographical restrictions.

TI Is Workers' Democracy a Possibility?

LA Russian
DT Article
DE workers' democracy; industrial democracy; self-government; social
   experiment; inequality
AB Modern social science gave birth to two basic paradigms with different attitudes to worker self-government - one elitist and one democratic. The first is based on Aristotle's idea of the natural character of production hierarchies, an eternal and insurmountable division of society into the government and the governed. The second paradigm calls for the inclusion of workers into the process of management. Each of the paradigms has a long history' and its own ideologists. Experiments in the implementation of democratic principles could not tip the balance in favor of either of the two paradigms. Though most of them failed in the short run, ultimately they provided clues for the industrial elites as to how to optimize production, keep workers employed in industries as citizens capable of participating in the political process, on the one side, and becoming consumers, on the other. The success or failure of these experiments was largely determined by the social and political context in which they were held and the ideological orientations of their architects. The early Russian experiments on worker self-government were held in conditions of the total centralization of production, the dominance of the planning system, which reduced the decision-making process on the shop-floor level to an absolute minimum. However, many of the forms of economic self-organization by workers remained in enterprises in the developed world. Cooperatives fully run by the workers themselves demonstrated a high level of economic effectiveness. The inclusion of workers into the management process is a necessary step to solve key problems of contemporary society, such as the problem of inequality.

DE public authority; openness; accessibility; glasnost; publicity;

AB The article analyzes provisions of the domestic doctrine on the understanding and correlation of the category of "openness" with related categories, such as "accessibility," "publicity,, "glasnost," and "transparency." Under conditions of the continuous development of information and telecommunication technologies, opportunities for public participation in controlling public authorities' activities are significantly expanding. The forms and methods of such participation are diverse and differently termed. In this connection, the unification of the conceptual-categorical framework is of particular importance, since the absence of a single scientifically grounded approach to understanding openness of public authorities hinders effective legal regulation of public relations in this sphere. The authors conclude that representatives of legal science consider "openness" the conception most widespread and broadest in scope that correlates with other categories close in subject and content, depending on functions performed by the public authorities. It also structurally combines "information openness" and the citizen involvement in the activities of government bodies. In turn, "accessibility" is understood as the possibility of unimpeded access to information about authorities' activities. "Glasnost" and "publicity" are expressed for the receipt and dissemination of information about activities of judicial and representative of the authorities. "Transparency," in its narrow sense, equals accessibility to information about activities of the authorities, while "transparency" in its broad sense is the equivalent of openness, which has become widespread in other socio-political sciences.

AB Modernization in its present form is viewed as continuation of the modernization process initiated in the 18th-20th centuries. Demands of modernization aim primarily at intellectual progress and associated economic, political and social processes and innovations. The study is devoted to finding out how modern transformations have affected the regional level, inspired by the Chechen model.
   The period of perestroika and attendant democratization happened at the time of the Chechen-Ingush Republic, now the Chechen Republic at the very peak of the economic and social crisis. In the 80s-90s, chaotic aspirations are observed in an attempt to find their place in the new world, leading to tragic events and war. Until 2000, Chechnya fought, and after 20 years the Chechen people together with the head of the republic, R. Kadyrov, expressed their needs.
   The period of peace for the Chechen people was at the beginning of the 21st century. Consequently, all new emerging phenomena including the period of informatization, democratization of society, development of civil foundations, structuring of parochial interests and many others in the Chechen society were delayed. Surprisingly, the most interesting thing in this situation turned out to be that "the wider the gap, the sooner people will develop streamlined and limited stereotypical reactions to the world around to cope with the difficulties and uncertainties caused by the gap." (Heiner, 1983). The novelty and relevance of study is that it delineates the impact of historical outcomes on the state of modern society. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy

   precedent; principles of law; source of law; systematization of

AB In the article, the authors based on unpublished earlier in Russian language materials, study the process of civil law formation as an independent branch of law in China, paying special attention to the beginning of the 20th century, when the Chinese legal system entered the modernization period. That period is characterized by the existence of a phenomenon of the absence of regulatory and legal material that regulates property and personal non-property social relations that form the basis of civil law, with the activities of the Supreme Court of the Republic of China. The court's presidents, having received a brilliant legal education, by relying on general principles of law, applying established legal customs, interpreting the old Qing legislation and doctrinal interpretation of draft laws, managed to create a unique law enforcement practice. In the framework of the legal system that takes most of the legal positions and constructions from the Roman-German legal family, the judicial precedent, without being formally declared as a source of law, actually took the predominant position in the hierarchy of sources for a decade and a half before it was adopted in 1929-1931, the first and only civil code of China. This situation became possible due to the fact that the leadership of the Qing Empire, long trying to keep the country in international isolation, as a result, was forced not only to open cities and ports for foreigners but also to actually take full advantage of the European right, mostly German, French and Belgian, etc. However, blind copying of legal norms did not give the desired result, and the political struggle after the abolition of the monarchy and the abrogation of the previous legislation created a legal vacuum that needed to be filled in by the judiciary and other law enforcement agencies. That allowed the Supreme Court of China not only to ensure the uniformity of judicial practice but also to become a lawmaking body, adapting the existing legal norms to the needs of contemporary reality. The Supreme Court summarized and systematized its own decisions for the first 7 years of activity, from 1912 to 1918, publishing them in the form of a collection of abstracts. In 1920 the collection was partially translated into English, and in 1924, into French. In 1923 it was supplemented with new jurisprudence and translated into Russian, but not published. And, despite the fact that the legal system of the PRC does not consider itself to any extent the successor of the legal system of the Republic of China, the study of the sources of law of the period 1912-1949 is a prerequisite for the fulfillment of the main function of any science - the growth of new knowledge, and in relation to legal science - understanding of legal traditions and approaches to solving problems and regulating social relations, which are also characteristic of modern Chinese society.

AB The review proposes the analyses of the intellectual experience of the historian of philosophy that is determined by the ideological and the political factors that lay behind the realm of the philosophy. The author proposes and arguments the theses about the mean role of the non-philosophical origins of the influence as for the philosophy as itself both the activity of the historian of philosophy. From the Greek ancient epoch the basis of the philosophy is the faith in the universal laws of the nature and their intelligible character the historian of philosophy based on the faith into the intelligible laws of the development of the thought, and their origin is the historicism that is doctrinally birth by the ideological corpus of the Western Enlightenment. The history of philosophy in the modern state is a space in which unfolds the activity of the historian of philosophy, representing an epistemological anarchist, but in reality, masking it visible anarchism its bias by the political paradigm of Western civilization. As a result, the history of philosophy turns out to be a sphere of unfolding specific political and ideological programs, and the experience of the historian of philosophy is not narrowly professional, but political work. This personal experience by its nature is decisive for the formation of the image of philosophy and the picture of its historical development. Given this fact, the author suggests the need to qualify the history of philosophy as a register of knowledge, which is constantly renewed problematic the central concepts, marking the basic conceptual points and the definition of the general direction of thought. As a result, the author proposes to recognize the historian of philosophy as much as a greater degree of creative freedom than is assumed in the traditional way of the intellectual, working in a positive way with the corpus of philosophical texts and ideas.

AB Introduction. The conservative trend is fashionable and highly sought in the political discourse of modern Russia. This indicates the relevance of studying the history of conservative thought. The novelty of the article is the attraction and analysis of new sources, which made it possible to concretize the attitude of N.M. Karamzin to Peter I. The aim of the study is to identify and establish the views of Karamzin on the role of Peter the Great in the history of Russia. The objectives are to identify the stages and directions of the evolution of the views of N.M. Karamzin on the reformer and his activities, determining the causes of its changes. Methods. The article uses the problem-chronological method within the framework of intellectual history. Analysis. Based on the analysis of the historian's work, it is asserted that through the end of the 18th century N.M. Karamzin extolled Peter the Great and justified his cruel reformation methods. Starting from the reign of reform-minded Alexander I of Russia and being influenced by revolutionary events in France, the Russian historian began to criticize Peter the Great. In his Memoir on Ancient and Modern Russia the historian criticized Peter's violation of national traditions and his barbaric methods of the country's Europeanization. Later, in the closing stages of the reign of Alexander I, the historian having considered Russia's victory over France, stepped back to his positive evaluation of Peter the Great as the ruler of the country, who laid the groundwork for Russia's power and prestige. Results. Thus, the article analyzes the evolution of the views of the major ideologist of Russian conservatism N.M. Karamzin on the role of Peter the Great in Russian history. Research gaps are closed, requiring filling by engaging sources for analysis not previously involved in scientific circulation.

DE higher school; universities; investment in development; development
   priorities
AB The determination of development priorities is an important component of university management. It is necessary to distinguish between declared priorities and actual ones. The declared priorities reflect the current political and intellectual conjuncture, while the real ones manifest the actual balance of players' power inside and outside the university and the beliefs of leaders about what is important for the university. The real priorities are actualized in "investment in development" in a broad sense (the whole set of investments in certain areas of activity, including placement of funds, expenses, time of managers and employees, provision of infrastructure, sites in the information space, branding and administrative support).
   The objective of this study is to determine the areas of investment in development: 1) which are essential for Russian universities ("proper areas"); 2) which are implemented in practice ("actual areas").
   The method used was an expert survey; the expert pool included professors and administrative staff of universities (1481 experts from 65 universities of the Russian Federation). The survey covered all regions of Russia from the European part to Siberia and the Far East. The survey period was September - October 2017.
   In the survey, the proper and actual priority in Russian universities of the following areas of investment was evaluated: 1) development of scientific schools; 2) deployment of exploratory, breakthrough research; 3) "new personnel" - attracting leading scientists and practitioners with unique experience to the university; 4) the adoption of new educational technologies; 5) attracting talented applicants; 6) the acquisition of modern laboratory equipment; 7) development of digital infrastructure (computer networks, computing power, digital educational environment, etc.); 8) the development of innovation infrastructure; 9) university campus; 10) international cooperation; 11) cooperation with business; 12) cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Science and federal agencies; 13) modernization of the management system; 14) the system of motivation and involvement of teachers, staff and students in development processes ("investment in activation"); 15) PR and university promotion.
   Analysis of the survey data identified six groups of areas of investment in development, depending on the level of proper and actual priority.
   A number of areas combine high due and actual priority, which is primarily an investment in the university's digital infrastructure. Other areas are underestimated in actual management practice, their actual priority is lower than it should be (for example, investment in modern scientific equipment and in the motivation system). Some areas, according to experts, are overestimated in the practice of managing the development of universities, such are cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Science and federal agencies; PR and university promotion.
   The results indicate a certain "deformation" in university management in Russia: the tasks of PR and university promotion and interactions with the Ministry of Education "supersede" other ones - to a lesser extent, the task of "digitalization", to a greater extent the task of investing in "activation", in cooperation (international and with business), in educational technologies, "new students" and especially in pioneering research, scientific schools and new personnel.

DE Shanghai Cooperation Organization; Central Asian security; Afghan

AB The article discusses new trends in the development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization after its expansion in 2018. The results of the Chinese presidency of the SCO in 2018 are also analyzed. It is shown that traditional priority for the SCO - Central Asian security issues in no way lose their significance. But if before Afghanistan could he considered mostly as an external factor of Central Asian security, now the settlement of the situation in the country acquires topicality and direct importance for the further work of the SCO as such.
   The accession of India and Pakistan in the SCO means both significant increase of the political and economic weight of the Organization, and the inevitable absorption by the Organization of India-Pakistan rivalry that previously was of only peripheral significance for the SCO. India's participation in the SCO seems to become a hindrance to the evolution of the Organization towards an anti-Western geopolitical alliance. The decisive factor for the further SCO development may be sought in the "Russia-India-China" (RIC) triangle activities. In this context, two scripts of the interaction between Russia, India and China should he considered. The first., and more realistic one assumes that Russian-Chinese and Russian-Indian relations within the triangle will have mostly positive impact on the inter-SCO situation, while Chinese-Indian relations may be much more troublesome. Under certain favorable conditions, the three countries will be able to develop a common stance on significant international issues or timely respond to crisis processes in economic or security spheres. The second script assumes a gradual qualitative deepening and expansion of cooperation within the RIC format, based on a common vision of geopolitical transformations in Greater Eurasia. In this case, it can be assumed that over time, the SCO will become the basis for the formation of the Great Eurasian Partnership.

   REGIONAL COMPLEX
SO SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE region; regional subsystem; regional complex; neorealism; neoliberalism;
   constructivism; World Regional Studies
AB The paper deals with the analysis of the concept "regional complex" by three mainstream approaches in the IR theory, namely, neorealism, neoliberalism, and social constructivism. In the English-speaking world the concept is mostly associated with the Regional Security Complexes Theory (RSCT) developed by Barry Buzan and Ole Waever. However, such understanding reads the concept too narrow. Russian scholars (Alexei D. Voskressenski, Ekaterina V. Koldunova) broaden this understanding by engaging developmental issues. Yet, it seems that the concept "regional complex" still needs further elaboration. The author aims to analyze the use of the concept in the available English and Russian academic literature in order to reveal its scientific value. Having found that existing interpretations do not identify unambiguously the meaning of the "regional complex", the author suggests her own definition of the regional complex as an integrated ("mature") regional subsystem, which possesses its own actorness based on the feeling of a specific regional identity that is shared by peoples of the region as well as extra-regional observers. The paper offers an analytic comparison of the notions "region", "regional subsystem", "regional complex". The main conclusion drawn by the author implies that the concept of "regional complex", virtually ignored by English-speaking academic community, deserves an entry in the Russian political science thesaurus because it helps to conceptualise a promising field of international relations, that is, regional and interregional interaction. It seems that the use of this term is meaningful and productive for further development of the Russian school of World Regional Studies.

DE Migration; internal repatriation; Chechen diaspora; adaptation;
   multiculturalism; revival of polyethnicity
AB In the 1990s and first decade of the twenty-first century, Chechens and other peoples left the republic for other Russian regions and foreign countries. Before, the main factors of migration were labor redundancy and lack of land resources. In the twentieth century, the large-scale and intensive migration was caused by stress factors: political instability, military actions, struggle of the federal government against separatism and counter-terrorism, economic decline, etc. Counter-terrorist activities which began in 1999 brought an end to ethnic cleansing of the republic - different peoples left the republic, and only Chechens returned. Even the Ingush did not really want to return and settled in Ingushetia. By this time, large-scale mono-ethnicization of Chechnya had been completed. It is crucial for successful adaptation of migrants to determine the social situation for themselves in their adaptative region or country. Having been granted a refugee status in Europe, being under the protection of European laws, Chechens do not forget their traditions and culture. Chechens consider numerous foreign diasporas as a threat to the Chechen nation or as a unique tool for integrating the Chechen Republic into the outside world, a factor of globalization.

AB The views on the problem of war and peace of one of the leading theorists of the Social Democratic movement Karl Kautsky is discussed in the article. The evolution of his views on the issues of the origin of wars, their types, methods of achieving peace, models of political power and the creation of global international systems is traced. A comparative analysis of the views of K. Kautsky with the views of representatives of other directions in Marxist ideology, its influence on the theoretical views of modern scholars is carried out. It covers the period from the beginning of the 20th century to the completion of the formation of the Versailles-Washington system of international relations, designed to consolidate the new world order, as well as the beginning of its collapse. The novelty of the study is that the social democratic concept of war and peace and K. Kautsky's theoretical views on this problem have not been sufficiently studied in modern Russian historiography. The author concludes that the concept of K. Kautsky, as well as the socialist theory as a whole, based on an understanding of the essence of war, laid down in the writings of the founders of Marxism, and close to a realistic school, have evolved in matters of peace and the postwar world order to liberalism. At the same time, K. Kautsky made a significant contribution to the theory of international relations, and his concept became the basis not only for neo-Marxism, but also enriched with some conclusions the theory of political realism and liberalism, as well as modern science as a whole.

AB The paper analyses philosophical and socio-philosophical articles in two "Novie Vekhi" collections, released in 1944 and 1945 on the initiative of the fascist Russian national social movement. The reference to the history of the collections is provided; famous russian scientists and philosophers who agreed on the ideological cooperation with the Vlasov army and with Nazi Germany took part in their creation. The content of the editorial statement on the need for spiritual overcoming of Bolshevism as the primary task of the intelligentsia is analyzed. The secion "Articles on philosophy" displays how "Novie Vekhi"'s authors, who fundamentally denied the possibility of materialist dialectics, criticize the materialistic solution of basic philosophical questions the notion of matter, the problem of relation of matter to consciousness, the emergence and development of life. The secion "Social philosophy" considers "Novie Vekhi"'s analyses of the economical, political and moral essence of socialism in the USSR and the critisism of Marxist doctrine of classes and class struggle. The paper highlights that "Novie Vekhi"'s authors rely on the representative circle of marxist works; and while fulfilling the tasks set by the publishing house, they attach particular significance to the chapter On Dialectical and Historical Materialism in the "History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): Short Course". In the section "Authors", the pseudonyms of the authors of the articles in the collections "Novie Vekhi" are revealed and also the information about pro fascist sympathies of some of them is provided. In conclusion, it is reasoned that the authors of "Novie Vekhi" were guided not by the search for the "philosophical truth", but by the hatred of the Soviet totalitarianism.

DE Rhee Syngman; media; ideology; media control
AB Rhee Syngman's policy was judged differently. It depended on the historical background. In the 1950s people saw Rhee as "a fighter for independence", "a protector of the nation", "a patriot". It can be explained by the objective reasons related to the confrontation of the South and the North during the Cold War. In addition, Rhee Syngman himself made efforts to create positive image of his policy.
   Rhee outlined seven points limiting the activity of the press. The main thing was the ban on publications that "run counter to national policy". Further, these restrictions became not only a way to protect the information field from communist influence, but also an excuse for attacking the political opposition.
   Not all media followed the direct instructions of the President, in a number of publications there were critical remarks addressed to him, but the content of the controversy was changing in view of changes in the political background. Before the Korean War, "left-wing" sentiments were strong in the South, but after 1953 the ideology of anti-communism became common to all, and controversy shifted to the issues of government, nature and quality of power structures. It was important for Rhee Syngman to create positive image of the ROK and its government in the press, both Korean and American. He tried to control information about Korea which was presented not only in national but also in foreign media.

DE Ethno-political; religious; common; civic; identity
AB The article deals with Ethnic political and ethnic religious processes in the Republic of North Ossetia - Alania that took place at the turn of the XX-XXI century. The study is relevant, because the need to study and analyse system management of culturally-complicated societies and their governance mechanisms was long overdue in the North Caucasus. System management in contrast to situation analysis makes it possible to determine and influence on systematic basis of regional crisis. In regional scientific discourse "the North Caucasus issue" contains several interrelated problems. These are problems of origin and history of inhabiting the North Caucasus societies; social, politic and juridical region identity; considering the region as cultural and historic integrity; and finally the problem of social crisis causes, ethnic and religious conflicts in the North Caucasus. The Republic of North Ossetia-Alaniaha difficult multi-ethnic and multi-religious composition of population. During the post-Soviet period the authorities of The Republic of North Ossetia - Alania managed to formulate interaction mechanisms between representatives of different ethnic and religious groups, directed at a minimisation of inter-ethnic and inter-religious confrontations. It is necessary to consider the current state of ethno-political and religious processes in the Republic of North Ossetia - Alania from the perspective of events, happened in the North Caucasus in late twentieth and early twenty first centuries, in the formation of current state national and cultural policy aimed to approve common civic identity - Russian Nation.

DE Iran; the United States of America; sanctions; economy; socio-economic
   development
AB Over the past ten years, the Islamic Republic of Iran has gone through several stages of sanctions policy by the United States and its allies, which included both a decreased economic pressure on the country and increased sanctions. Sanctions were likely to cause the deterioration of national socio-economic indicators, which, in turn, could not but affect the overall developments in the state and society. Since 2012, Iran has come under new sanctions targeted at the key economic sector - the oil industry. The result was a new wave of deterioration in the country's socio-economic indicators and a decrease in household incomes. After signing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action between Iran and a group of countries dedicated to the nuclear program of Iran, the country began to restore its socio-economic development at a rapid pace. However, by 2017, growth slowed down, which was one of the factors behind the mass demonstrations of late 2017 - early 2018. Announced in early May 2018 by Donald Trump, the US decision to withdraw from the agreement turned out to be a shock for the Iran economy, marked by a rise in prices and a more than threefold decrease in the exchange rate of national currency. Many foreign companies were forced to leave Iran and abandon their economic relations with it. However, the country, either then or ever since, has not changed its domestic and foreign strategy, which indicates the relative stability of the Islamic political regime in Iran..

TI Moscow Treaty of the USSR-Germany and "Letter on German Unity". From
   Conflict to Compromise
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Moscow Treaty; Letter on German unity; Moscow Bar mission; A.A. Gromyko;
   V. Brandt; V. Scheel
AB The article considers the course and results of the Soviet-West German negotiations that led to the conclusion of the Moscow Treaty of August 12, 1970, which became an important factor in defusing international tensions on the European continent. Special attention is paid to the problem of the genesis of the so-called "Letter on German unity", the adoption of which the Soviet side stubbornly insisted on the representatives of Germany. The article reveals the flexible tactics of the Soviet delegation, which was headed by the Minister of foreign Affairs of the USSR AA. Gromyko: taking into account, in particular, the position of the GDR, the diplomats opposed the inclusion in the text of the Treaty of any provisions relating to the unification of Germany, but left open the prospect of such unification in the future. Some realism and willingness to compromise showed and West German negotiators, among whom special credit belongs to the personal emissary of Chancellor Brandt E. Bahr. On the basis of these compromises, a common position of the parties on the conclusion and subsequent ratification of the Moscow Treaty was worked out. The article pays due attention to the "US factor" in Soviet-West German relations. Formally declaring a positive attitude to the" new Eastern policy " of Germany, in fact the American side tried to compromise it in every possible way and complicate the process of preparing the Moscow Treaty. There is also some inconsistency in the German diplomacy in departing from previous political dogmas, primarily from the claims to the sole representation of all Germans. The main conclusion of the article is that as a result of the complex and sometimes conflicting Soviet-West German negotiation process, its participants managed to overcome the real contradiction between the principle of inviolability of borders and the right to national self-determination. In the current international situation, when this contradiction is artificially aggravated by the supporters of confrontation, the experience gained in the development and coordination of the provisions of the Moscow Treaty is of actual practical importance. The work is written on the basis of previously not entered into scientific circulation of primary sources from the Archive of foreign policy of the Russian Federation, as well as published West German documents.

TI COMMODIFICATION AS FACTOR OF MORAL AND POLITICAL PROGRESS
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE commodification; capitalism; morality; neoliberalism; market; values
AB The article attempts to understand the phenomenon of commodification. Today, discussions on commodification usually reproduce the key points of the old, moralized debates about capitalism. Commodification is considered almost exclusively a derivative of capitalism that reached its highest triumph in the neoliberal era. This prevents an adequate understanding of this phenomenon. Commodification is much older than capitalism, therefore its moral aspects are much broader than the effects of capitalism on the sphere of morality and ethics.
   The focus of discussions on commodification is largely determined by the widespread opinion that in a "normal" state of the society morality and market are isolated areas, and market destroys moral values. The article expresses and justifies the argument that there is no clear boundary between these areas, which opens up a possibility for significantly less univocal assessments of the historical and social role of commodification. The author demonstrates that in many cases the monetary value serves as a benchmark for the social value of a particular practice, emphasizes the universalizing and emancipating effect of commodification, and reveals the meaning of a reduction of free labor caused by commodification. According to his conclusion, it is commodification that contributes to the primary formation of universal (and simply human) values - in their commodity form.
   In the final part of the article the author analyzes the relationship between commodification and neoliberal transformation of capitalism. Having documented the transformation of an individual into "human capital" over the recent years, the author interprets this trend as being indicative of the fact that today, for the first time in history, the "human" as it is, in its full, or almost full, volume, acquires a primary "economic" form of the universal value.

AB The article is devoted to the problem of countering the religious extremism ideology among new generation of the North Caucasus region and particularly the Chechen Republic. In modern conditions of contradictions aggravation in the spiritual geostrategic space for the national security of Russia and its regions, the threats in the spiritual sphere are the most dangerous. Among them acts of religious extremism are very serious, whose young adherents use the Islamist ideology in their criminal practices. In order to increase the effectiveness of the struggle against this religious-extremist ideology in the youth environment, new approaches, forms and methods are required that are adequate to the dynamics of modern spiritual and religious expansion. The subject of the article is the countering system analysis of religious extremism ideology among young people. On the basis of empirical studies of various levels, the authors try to reveal the problem of spiritual, ideological and theoretical opposition to extremism and terrorism. According to the authors, an important factor in countering the ideology of youth religious extremism is the revelation of its reactionary essence, the entire complex of religious-dogmatic, political and legal ideas, views based on an alternative ideological system of traditional religious trends and particularly Sufi dogma and cult practice. The article analyzes the general and specific reasons for replenishing the ranks of extremist organizations with modern youth, and reveals some tasks of spiritual and moral education aimed at ensuring the spiritual security of new generation and protecting its traditional spiritual, moral and religious values.

TI THE INTERPRETATION OF THE "GREAT STAND ON THE UGRA RIVER" IN 1480
SO ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Great Stand on the Ugra River; Akhmat Khan; Grand Duke of Moscow Ivan
   III; Moscow State; Golden Horde; Tatar Khanates
AB Objective: Based on a systematic method of historical information and a partial historical reconstruction using narrative sources, the objective here is to cast doubt on the interpretation of the Great Stand on the Ugra River in 1480 as the liberation of Rus'ian lands from dependence on the Horde.
   Research materials: A number of synchronous annalistic sources and acts containing information about the event. This material obviously contradicts the Soviet interpretation of the issue, which has remained popular in modern historiography. In addition, modern domestic and foreign studies also contain voluminous materials that do not allow us to consider this event as a release from Horde.
   Results and novelty of the research: The published sources do not allow us to consider the Great Stand on the Ugra River in 1480 as an event that put an end to the dependence of the Rus'ian lands on the Horde. Several obvious circumstances provide evidence for the judgment advanced here. Firstly, the chronicles attribute the resolution of this conflict to divine power and describe this event in a way that does not allow us to consider it as a victory for either the Rus'ian or the Horde's military forces. Secondly, the continued payment of tribute to the Tatar khanates indicates both the long-term dependence of the Rus'ian lands and the preservation of the internal unity of the post-Horde political space which continued to pose a threat to the Moscow state. The research results are shared by modern experts on the history of the Golden Horde and the Tatar Khanates.

DE Migration; Northeast Asia; China; Republic of Korea; Taiwan; Russian Far

AB The subject of this study is processes of migration and how these relate to national, regional and international security: 1. A consideration of threats to the security of the Russian Far East in connection with external and internal migration. 2. Similar processes in the countries of the Northeast Asia region and their influence on the state of regional security as a whole. The purpose of the work is to analyze the above-mentioned phenomenon in Northeast Asia, as well as the impact of migration processes on regional security. Comparative and historical approaches are used in the research. These approaches made it possible to analyze the particularities of shaping the "agenda" of regional security in NEA and, in particular, in matters of migration. In addition, they facilitate an analysis of how national approaches to ensuring security in the region and threats in the field of migration (in parallel with them) have changed. While there is a sufficiently large number of studies on migration in general, there is currently no work in Russian political science that deals with the problems of migration in Northeast Asia in the context of regional and international security. Migration is a real, not a potential, security threat.

TI Autobiography of Arjia Rinpoche as a Source on the Tibetan History
SO HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST
LA English
DT Article
DE Arjia Rinpoche; Kumbum; China; Tibet; Sino-Tibetan relations
AB The article analyzes the life and activities of Arjia Rinpoche, director of the Tibetan-Mongolian Cultural Center in Bloomington, in the context of the contemporary history of China and its ethnic minorities. Arjia Rinpoche is the former abbot of an influential Buddhist monastery Kumbum in Eastern Tibet and the incarnation of Tsongkhapa's father, its founder. In addition to his high religious position, he held important posts in the system of Chinese state power. However these regalia notwithstanding, in 1998 Arjia-Rinpoche fled the country with great risk to his life and became a powerless refugee. In 2010 Arjia-Rinpoche's autobiography was published in the United States in English. In 2013 its extended and revised edition (571 p.) was published in Chinese. The author of this article has translated the book in the Russian and it awaits publication in the "Buryad-Mongol Nome" publishing house. The article analyzes Arjia Rinpoche's autobiography as an important source on ethnography and history of the Tibetans and Mongols of the PRC and their relationship with the Chinese state. The life and activities of Arjia Rinpoche are studied in the context of contemporary history of the PRC. Arjia Rinpoche himself has divided his life into eight-year cycles. Each loosely corresponds to a certain stage in the history of the PRC. There are six cycles since Arjia Rinpoche's birth in 1950 to his escape from the PRC in 1998. At the age of two he was recognized as reincarnation of Arjia Rinpoche, abbot of the Kumbum monastery. At the age of eight, religious reform in the monastery cardinally changed his life and he went through vicissitudes of political campaigns and the Cultural Revolution in the two successive cycles. With the beginning of the socio-political and economic reforms initiated after the death of Mao Zedong in 1978, he became the head of Kumbum and grew involved in politics. In 1995, in the last period of his life in the PRC, there was a big conflict between the PRC government and the Dalai Lama over recognition of the 11th incarnation of the Panchen Lama. In order to legitimize their chosen candidate, the authorities suggested that Arjia-Rinpoche become his religious teacher. In reaction to that, the lama made his secret escape from the country. The author concludes that Arjia Rinpoche is one of the most important religious and political figures in Tibet, and his autobiography is one of the most valuable and reliable sources on ethnography and history of Tibet and China in general.

AB Hannah Arendt is well-studied in Russia; her legacy is noticeable in academic discussions. However, her theoretical positions can hardly bring about a significant change in the present state of local political and philosophical affairs. The reason is the same for both the unusual popularity of her theoretical concepts and their lack of practical relevance. Her non-traditional approach to politics seamlessly fits into recurrent patterns of Russian social life which are no-less distant from the established forms of Western political culture. Being uncritically transplanted into different soil, her unorthodox way of thinking about politics found an immediate enthusiastic reception in Russia, but not at the same level of scrutiny as was in the West. Paradoxically, this proves that Arendt's views may confirm the local status-quo, rather than challenging it. In this paper, I will try to explain this paradox by presenting both the elements of her theory that remain under-appreciated by her Russian followers, and her dogmatic positions shared with her school of thought, which can be elucidated by reading them against the Russian context. Arendt's theory features hidden, but distinct, elitist, and liberal tendencies; to some degree, her theory goes well with the Machiavellian character of contemporary Russian politics. However, at the exact point when she finds an unlikely ally in Isaiah Berlin, her normative solutions mostly go unnoticed. On the other hand, reading her texts against the Russian experience exposes some of her preconceptions about human existence, the meaning of political life, and our relations to history, all of which weaken the practical relevance of her thoughts.

AB The formation of Russia as a multiethnic empire required the state to adopt the policy, which would ensure the integration of its people, supremacy of centripetal trends, and strength of its unity. The authorities considered the Orthodoxy of the non-Christian people including the Kalmyks as one of the key successful tools of such policy. The Christianization of Kalmyk nomads had to be that spiritual and ideological factor of their integration into a uniform national political, economic, sociocultural space of the country. The historical experience of missionary activity of the Russian Orthodox Church among the non-Christian people still did not receive an exhaustive comprehensive study, which in itself represents an urgent problem of historical science.
   Among Kalmyk nomads the range and methods of activity of official church representatives prior to the beginning of the 20th century could not be (invariant) fixed, unchanged as they were carried out taking into account both external and internal factors, and considering the change of the status of nomads as part of Russia. During certain historical periods and depending on such changes the missionary activity of ROC were stopped or encouraged by the state, its forms and methods were also changed.

DT Article
DE poverty; state; human rights; social state; social policy
AB The article discusses the social and worldview background for the formation of the phenomenon of the social state in the Western European civilization of the 18th-19th centuries. Its formation was connected with reconsideration of idea of "the public benefit outside which there were a poverty and a social inequality. This tendency to ignore poverty and social inequality was maintained by faith in the omnipotence of a rationally organized state. The latter for two centuries solved the problem of poverty with measures of isolation, moral condemnation and disciplinary violence. Gradually together with destruction of former rationalism and a mechanistic picture of the world, development of national education systems there is a suspicion to "reasonably arrange" public system and the state crowning it. New idea of the state is developed. Now it includes in the sphere of the responsibility besides the political rights of the person and citizen his social rights. The leading role in this process in the second half of the 19th the first third of the 20th century belongs to the socialist thought which had considerable impact on domestic policy of many countries of Europe and USA. Therefore the first stage of formation of the social state can be characterized as socialist.

DT Article
DE Islamism; radical Islamism; moderate Islamism; fundamentalism; the
   Middle East; Islamic societies; politicized Islam
AB It is impossible to understand modern Islamic (especially Arab) societies without taking into account the influence of Islamism as an ideology, cultural environment, mode of action, and lifestyle. Unfortunately, Islamism in many ways has remained a "phenomenon lurking behind the surface." In this article we will focus on the analysis of some political aspects of modern Islamism, showing how Islamism behaves when in opposition (where it feels more confident) and what happens when Islamists come to power in a legitimate way. We would like to show that Islamism is not something superficial, but the deepest and most comprehensive substance of Islamic societies. Therefore, it is extremely important to distinguish between radical and moderate substance of Islamic societies. Therefore, it is extremely important to distinguish between radical and moderate Islamism, relying on the latter to weaken the former, since moderate Islamism can grow to be a positive and promising part of the political spectrum of Islamic countries. We believe that it is impossible to reduce the danger of radical terrorist Islamism by force alone. We can hope that this will decline if it can be divided by moderate Islamism and make the latter more respectable, open, and involved in normal political life.

DT Article
DE academic corporation; "collective portrait"; provincial science;
   historians of Omsk; communication
AB The article attempts to explore the academic community of Omsk historians at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries. The parameters of the study, specified by the authors, make it possible to catch the dynamics of the development of the community. The analysis is caused by the search for professional identity of the modern historian, with the urgent need to understand the relationship of avant-garde and provincial features in the historiographical process, with unexplored problems of historical academic communities in the local context in the period of radical political and social transformations in Russia. The methodological basis of the study was a neoinstitutional approach, the development of the philosophy of science and the communicative field of Pierre Bourdieu. Based on the analysis of the results of questionnaire held in 2017-2018, data from the biobibliographic dictionary "Modern historical science of Western Siberia in persons. Bibliographic dictionary. Historians of Omsk" (1999), records of dissertation councils and academic societies, and regional periodicals, a number of parameters for the collective portrait of a corporation of historians of a particular city was set. Firstly, the institutional localization of the corporation was determined. In the development of the institutional component of the Omsk historical science in the designated period, there are two stages ("romantic" and "compression"), which had a direct impact on the other parameters of the "portrait". Secondly, the numerical and gender composition of the corporation (about 200 people), which is represented by three generations of Omsk historians, has been determined. The authors also managed to establish the dynamics of changes: 1) the ratio of the number of men and women in a corporation; 2) the "leading / main" centers of vocational education; 3) the dynamics of obtaining academic degrees by historians. Thirdly, the main problems of the academic research of Omsk historians and the fragmentation of the problem field were revealed, correlated with the main directions of the development of historical science in the designated period. Fourth, the dynamics of the communication field is traced both as a reflection of intellectual tensions inside the corporation and outside of it - incorporation into new horizontal networks.

AB In modern Russia there is no national philosophical award, as there are no other forms of official recognition of the merits of philosophers. The prize (provided it is based on a substantive and not on ideological and political grounds) is not only a difference, a reward and a reward for real achievements, but also provides a reference point for the philosophical and humanitarian communities, as well as for all who are interested in history and the modem state of forms and strategies of thought. The phenomenon of the award in Russia is considered, on the example of the award of the philosophical society of St. Petersburg "Second navigation", its history, ideology and problems. An important component of the society is the public activity of the philosopher.

AB One of the new forms of educational and scientific cooperation between Russia and China, along with the creation of joint educational institutions, is the establishment of bilateral associations.
   Currently, there are eight specialized associations of universities and two regional ones. The first association of universities in Russia and China was of a profile nature: in 2011, ATURK (Association of Technical Universities of Russia and China) was established. For the period from 2014 to 2017. seven more specialized associations of universities were formed: economic, pedagogical, medical, transport, universities of culture and arts, journalistic and classical, and two regional associations: Association of universities of the Far East and Siberia of Russia and Northeast regions of China and the Association of universities of the Volga Federal District regions and the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. In 2018, the two countries also established the Association for Scientific and Technical Cooperation of the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, its founders from the Russian side were the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and from the Chinese side the Academy of Sciences of Heilongjiang Province. In addition, in 2014, the Association of Graduates and Trainees of Chinese Universities was established.
   These facts indicate that the association is becoming a new form of organization of educational and scientific cooperation between the two countries. It is obvious that the process of creating associations of universities starting in 2014 has a planned centralized nature, initiated by the Chinese side. In the creation of associations of higher education institutions, the message can be traced to streamline the sporadic cooperation between Russian and Chinese universities, to direct it towards improving the quality of specialized education and strengthening research cooperation between universities of the two countries. At the same time, this form of organization of interaction gives cooperation of universities a fundamentally different character than that which was until 2014: the nature of network interaction, during which every Russian university or research organization is in direct interaction with the Chinese side.

DE anthropological dimensions; political culture; political memory;
   political myth; symbolic representations
AB The authors discuss the significance of anthropological concepts in the analysis of political culture as carried out in both applied and theoretical studies of current political communications in transitional political processes. Drawing on a history of methodological and theoretical debates in political science and anthropology, the authors examine methodological issues of studying discourses of political memory as a symbolic representation of socio-cultural specifics of temporal dimensions of a given political culture. They emphasize the importance of describing and theoretically analyzing the role of political myths and symbols present in political memory in transition societies and point out that analysis of political myths as a symbiotic mechanism (or as a source of reproducing and delineating 'political passions') closely connected with symbolic practices of coercion highlights the role of culture in variability of political transition processes. They argue that a focus on political culture as a historically specific form of social memory allows one to examine differences in models of political culture within structures and practices of everyday life. Using an anthropologically oriented political analysis as a theoretical basis, the authors suggest a new theoretical approach to the study of contemporary political communications and argue for a need to develop new strategies of research of political culture in sociology and political science.

AB Recently there has been a growing interest to scientific journalism of both researchers and the professional community in Russia but is practically not in demand by a wide audience. The development of specialized publications contributes to the renewal of the genre structure of scientific journalism, including through journalistic investigation. Science faces with some problems of fraud and pseudoopenings, the activities of individual scientists and institutions are at the center of scandals not directly related to science. These topics cause a public reaction and don't require special preparation from the audience or the journalists themselves at the same time. The investigation in scientific journalism includes a comprehensive study of a particular research or scientific branch in order to competently present scientific results to the audience and to verify official information. In the first case, scientific problems attract the attention of professional journalists, in the second one professional scientists become authors, mostly bloggers. The principles of organizing the scientific community in the blogosphere affect the traditional media, inviting scientists to cooperate both as authors and as experts. The popular scientific newspaper "Troitsky variant - Science" is considered as an example. Such venues become a place for posing discussion issues, discussing pressing problems, and not only of a scientific nature. An example of the implementation of the investigative potential in the media materials is publications about the activities of the "Dissernet", which is exposing fraud in science. At the same time, under the guise of a journalistic investigation on scientific topics, a wide audience is offered uncritical materials or are devoted to pseudoscientific questions. With the visible observance of genre requirements, we observe a substitution of concepts not only when the society assesses journalistic investigations, but also when evaluating scientific activity, when forming its own picture of the world.

AB The article analyzes the role of the Egyptian military-political elite on the eve of the Revolution of 1952, when the military came to power, led by Gamal Abdel Nasser. The study of the history and activities of the organization "Free Officers" is hardly possible without considering the evolution of the national-patriotic and political movements in the Egyptian army. During the second quarter of the 20th century the Egyptian society experienced fairly turbulent and eventful political process that influenced the further development of the country. At present the study of role of army in liberation movement in the Middle East is extremely urgent since military structures have become the base of the state system of many Arabic countries. The army has sufficiently influenced to the political development of the states. In connection with the recent transformations in the Middle East, that witnessed crises of political systems and statehood, the consideration of military elites, their coming to power and impact on a political system is important for the study of the general issues of the Middle East.
   The author considers the factors which influenced the evolutionary transformation of the Egyptian military before and after the World War II, as well as the social origins of the officer corps. Moreover, the object of the study includes the entire period of the national liberation movement of the Egyptian people, when almost all segments of Egyptian society were involved in this struggle. An important aspect of this trend is that, in the run-up to the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the officers and the military elite became a more prepared and organized than other groups and was able to quickly and almost bloodlessly take power into their own hands.
   The article notes that it is impossible to solve urgent social problems and overcome economic backwardness without centralized strong leadership. While forming the Egyptian statehood and the Kingdom of Egypt, there were three centers of power - Wafd party led by Saad Zaghloul, the king and his supporters, as well as Great Britain, which retained control over Egypt. Given the absence of one center of power in the country, as well as the weakness and dependence of the existing ones, opposition movements with different views on the development of Egypt were created. The society of "Muslim Brotherhood" was one of them, eventually discrediting itself during its further development. "Free Officers" were able to establish themselves as a secret society, which ideologically did not belong to any political camp. Coherence, hierarchy and army solidarity became effective advantages in their struggle for power.

AB The article presents information from the biography of a famous Dagestan religious and political figure of the 19th century, a Sufi Sheikh Abdurahman-Haji al-Suguri. The study was based on a written monument of the Dagestan Arabic-language literature of the early 20th century - collection of Sufi biographies "Hikaya va manakib al-Mashaih an-nakshbandiyin". This hagiographic work relates to the manakib genre, one of the varieties of Arab-Muslim living literature. On the example of information about Sheikh Abdurakhman-Haji, given in this work, we attempt to study the specific features of the presentation of the biography of a well-known historical person in the context of the narrative of the unreal events in his life. Sheikh Abdurahman-Haji is represented here in the image of a saint who has the mystical powers of miracles (Karamat). Moreover, the essay contains fantastic episodes from his life associated with other well-known Muslim thinkers and theologians. At the same time, during the work on the Arabic-language text of the essay, was revealed information clarifying previously known facts from the biography of a famous religious figure who played an important role in spreading the ideology of Sufism in Dagestan, as well as a significant figure in the social and political life of the Northeast Caucasus 19th century.

The article accented on the special role of regional economy in efficient managing economic transition insurance. Authors believe that is why the elaboration of new approaches to public management and regulation of economic, political and social processes in the Republic, formation of priorities and best strategies of sustainable development policies are the pressing scientific and practical challenge. It is impossible to set up an efficient industrial sector without compliance with the basic requirements of market economy and total investment climate improvement in the Republic, which is highly relevant in the formation of the States and, respectively, the Republican digital economy. The industry modernization requires organizational and economic mechanisms of its development resources. At the turn of the first and the second decades of the current century the world's economy begins the reindustrialization - the new phase of development, when the intellectual capital, arising from information and knowledge convergence, became the leading economical resource of the development, and it's existence - the main competitive advantage of enterprises, business groups and the whole society.

AB In the previous issues of our journal we have repeatedly addressed the problem of ineffectiveness of the Government's implementation of the President's instructions, which Vladimir Putin voiced in his Addresses to the Federal Assembly, in "May Decrees", etc. In the 2018-2024 political cycle, the main directions of state policy are implemented through 12 national projects. The comprehensive analysis of expert opinions urges us to talk about the threat of disruption of their implementation once again. The following materials analyze the essence of national projects, the dynamics of their implementation, since their adoption (2005), during V. Putin's third presidential term (2012-2018), as well as the specifics of the current socio-political situation in Russia in 2018-2019, which urgently requires a qualitative increase in the responsibility of the elites for the comprehensive achievement of the targets specified in the national projects for 2018-2024.

AB In 2018, Russian society faced a contradiction, caused by the discrepancy between the official political rhetoric and the real actions of the Government. Instead of the priorities stated in the President's Address to the Federal Assembly and in the "May decree" (reducing poverty twofold, Russia's joining the top five economies of the world, etc.), the society was faced with the need to take a "bitter medicine" in the form of raising the retirement age. Moreover, the news about the changes in pension legislation reached the general public just after the inauguration of the President (the inauguration took place on May 7, 2018, and the draft law on the pension reform was submitted to the State Duma on June 16). The initial reaction to the pension reform was adamantly negative: according to the surveys conducted by the Public Opinion Foundation, almost 80% of Russians were against the reform. Over the following months, a wave of protests swept across the country and stopped only after Vladimir Putin made an official appeal to the Russian people on August 29 and explained that the pension system has to be reformed; he proposed some adjustments that would soften some conditions of the reform for certain population groups. However, despite the fact that the visible signs of public discontent (protests, critical articles, etc.) are gradually fading, the level of people's support for the authorities, including the President of the Russian Federation, continued to decline; fundamental changes began to take place in the public consciousness, and such changes are of a long-term nature. This fact proves that the pension reform only triggered a more profound internal discontent that has been accumulating over the last years. Thus, at the beginning of 2019, the fundamental question concerning the legitimacy of power in Russia became one of the most pressing and urgent for society and authorities with regard to actual implementation of the tasks set out in the "May Decree", qualitative growth of the standard of living and, by and large, preservation of the Russian statehood. A deep and ideologically saturated article of V. Putin's personal adviser V. Surkov, which was published in February 2019, addresses this very issue (as some experts think), and it has caused a wide resonance in the academic, political and social environment. The following materials present our views on Surkov's article and on a significant set of issues raised in it. The conclusions we come to are supported not only by the results of our own studies of the long-term dynamics of public opinion, but also by expert assessments, which largely reflect the real situation in the country.

AB Previous issues of our journal contain editorials devoted to the most acute issues of Russia's modern life and its future. Using expert assessments and the results of international, national and our own research, we touched upon key aspects of public administration efficiency in addressing the issues that ensure national security. These tasks are as follows: overcoming social inequality and "capitalism for the few", ensuring the stability of the psychological state of society and promoting civic engagement of its main strata. We analyzed the state of affairs in science and education, in the economy and social sphere; we gave an objective assessment of the President's key speeches and analyzed how effectively the Government was implementing the President's orders (including those that were set out in the "May decrees"). We covered the most resonant events happening in the internal and international political arena. In the context of national security, we analyzed the correlation of interests of the general population and the elite. On repeated occasions, we considered the historical experience of Russia and foreign countries, drew analogies between the past and the present, trying to answer the question of how well the ruling elite learns the lesson and promotes sustainable development of the country in order to handle the increasingly complex conditions of global competition in the 21st century.
   We should point out that, as the President himself has repeatedly noted, public opinion is the main criterion that determines the success of the work of the government and public administration efficiency, and influences the changes in the situation in the country. At the same time, the beginning of 2019 can be seen as a starting point in the implementation of the main provisions of the May 2018 Decree and, more broadly, in the implementation of the targets for the breakthrough development of the internal, primarily socio-economic, situation in Russia. Achieving these goals is a keynote of the new political cycle and the last (according to the current Constitution of the Russian Federation) presidential term of Vladimir Putin.
   We decided to begin the first 2019 issue of the journal Economic and Social Changes: Facts, Trends, Forecast by analyzing key trends in people's subjective assessments concerning various aspects of everyday life over the past 18 years, including the dynamic changes taking place in the assessment of the work of public authorities, in the perception of living standards and the quality of life, and in the emotional and psychological background in society. The main information source that allows us to implement such a task is the sociological monitoring conducted by VolRC RAS on the territory of the Vologda Oblast for more than 20 years (since 1996).
   The following tables show trends in a number of parameters of social well-being and socio-political sentiment of the Vologda Oblast residents in the long-term (annual) retrospective, as well as current (last six waves of the monitoring) changes in public opinion.
   When analyzing current trends in public opinion, we place an emphasis on the results of V. Putin's third presidential term (2012-2017) and on the current dynamics of people's estimates (the latest six surveys: April 2018 - February 2019). These results show how well the head of state is able to build a system of public administration at all levels (federal, regional, municipal) in accordance with the goals noted in his Address to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and set out in the May 2018 Decree and also in accordance with the task of effective transit of Russian statehood for the period up to 2024, the task that is strategically important for national security.

AB The article deals with the issue of the transit of power in 2024 and the role of civil society in addressing key tasks that the head of state has to deal with in the period before the election to the State Duma of the Russian Federation (2021) and the presidential election (2024). We investigate historical aspects of the transit of power in Russia that show the broad and complex scale of its implications for social development. We provide forecasts and expert assessments of the current situation in the country as a factor in the possible success of the transit of power in 2024. On the basis of the data of the all-Russian and regional sociological studies implemented in the form of a monitoring we analyze the dynamics of public opinion on key issues related to public and personal needs that are actual and expected to be implemented. The analysis reveals that the most acute problems of concern to the population are long-term and unresolved. On the background of the launch (unsuccessful in many ways) of national projects 2018 and worrying forecasts about the prospects for the future of Russia, and given the fact that Russia's economy has overcome the period of stagnation observed since 2014, this brings to the fore the issue concerning the effectiveness of public administration in the new political cycle in which (according to the Constitution of the Russian Federation) Vladimir Putin will not be able to take the post of head of state. In the "transit" period (the period remaining until the State Duma election of 2021 and the presidential election of 2024), the President has to deal with the tasks of a higher level. One of them is related to the implementation of the potential of civil society accumulated over the past 20 years, since civil society is an active entity representing the interests of the general population in dialogue with the authorities at all levels of government. The solution to this problem can guarantee a successful "transit" of the Russian society in a new historical period.

AB September 8 was a single voting day in Russia: 13 constituent entities of the Russian Federation elected deputies of state legislative bodies*; 19 constituent entities elected their heads**. This was one of the main events of 2019 for the domestic political life of Russia, because the results of the elections, in fact, reflect the socio-political agenda of today; they show people's attitude toward the political and economic course implemented by the Russian government and serve as a criterion for assessing its effectiveness. The following materials provide an analysis of the electoral preferences of Russians, manifested in the level of support for the head of state and reflecting the interests of the ruling elites of the United Russia party; in the dynamics of voter turnout in Russia and in the number of votes cast for parliamentary parties representing the systemic opposition. To obtain an objective "picture" of today, we analyse the results of the previous elections (2017-2018), as well as the last three elections to the State Duma (2007, 2011, 2016) and the presidential elections in which Vladimir Putin took part (2000, 2004, 2012, 2018).

   formation; patriotism
AB The article presents an overview describing researches of the 1950s - 70s in China concerning the Confucian patriotic ideology by Gu Yanwu (1613-1682).The value of Gu Yanwu's ideas is determined because of his plural references to the origins of Chinese Five Classics. It is especially important now thatthe President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping reveals a very deep interest in the study of them.
   The meaning of Confucian pragmatism could hardly been overestimated during the reign of the Kuomintang party. Its main ideologist Zhang Binglin (1869-1936) studied Gu Yanwu's texts for a long time, from childhood considered himself a successor of the Confucian patriotic tradition. As for representatives of the Chinese science of the 20th century, such as Liang Qichao and Hu Shi, Hou Wailu and Qiu Hansheng, patriotic ideology inspired them to develop their own approaches. It was clear that the new Chinese worldview, which also included Chinese Marxism, should be based on Chinese significant accomplishments. In the teachings of Gu Yanwu, they were impressed by the strategy of changing Chinese society. They continued to embody Gu Yanwu's experience, who had an open mind and interpreted Confucianism without cuts.
   Young Mao Zedong highly valued ideas of Gu Yanwu, especially his idea of uncompromising struggle. Both recognized struggle in a favor of China, which became the meaning of life.After the end of the war in Korea, the Communist ideology needed to adapt to the new conditions. The international isolation could actually destroy the countries of people's democracy.The search for an effective development strategy drew attention to the patriotic ideology, which supported teachings of Gu Yanwu in the 1950s and the first half of the 60s. The "cultural revolution" influenced the scientific community, but researches on Gu Yanwu's heritage continued. The Chinese economic reform and open-door policy, begun by Deng Xiaoping in 1978, finally replaced the policy of condemnation of Chinese civilization history. Proponents of the Confucian revision of Marxism realized that collaboration with the radicalforces is not possible. That is why Chinese President Xi Jinping has adopted some of the time-tested patriotic ideas, offered by GuYanwu.

AB This article is devoted to forced migration of the people of the North Caucasus during the Stalinist regime. Using the example of Chechens and Ingushes, we attempted to apply the mechanism of using destructive measures of influence not only on certain groups of people, but also on whole nations. After arriving in Kazakhstan, people were distributed among collective farms, construction sites, mines, and enterprises with the status of "special settlement". The adaptation period for Chechens and Ingushes in Kazakhstan was difficult. Analysis of the status of special settlers, their living conditions, political and moral status, as well as measures taken by the state in relation to special settlers, convinces that the deportation of people to Kazakhstan was a political move of the totalitarian regime. Many Chechens and Ingushes did not agree with the powerless position and expressed dissatisfaction with their position in various protest forms. Due to limited human resources, the work of the special settlers was widely used in various areas of production: agricultural work, construction of mines, coal mining, mining, industrial and civil construction, and other sectors of the Kazakhstan economy. The USSR made successful attempts to socialize Chechens and Ingush in the places of their new residence. One of the objectives of these attempts was to prevent their physical extinction, mainly from disease, disorder and famine. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

AB The article presents some formation and development aspects of Grozny. In the period under review, Grozny was a district city of Terek region like Mozdok and Kizlyar. The fortress of Grozny, founded in 1818 during the creation of the Sunzhenskaya military line, later played an important role in conducting the aggressive policy of tsarism. During hostilities, Grozny became the seat of the commander of the left flank of the Caucasian military line and the assembly point of military units heading into the depths of Chechnya and Dagestan. In 1871, Grozny became a district city with the right to city self-government, in which the police district office and other city services were located. In the very first year of turning Grozny into a district centre, various administrative, managerial and economic institutions began to grow. In the XVIII century some areas of the North Caucasus maintained political ties with the Russians, but in general the region was not yet a part of the state administrative system. In addition, Georgia, which had the southern borders with the North Caucasus, was ruined by the wars with Turkey and Persia, and sought to strengthen its North Caucasian ties.

AB Ethnosocial stratification of the population of the Russian colony of Ross (now Fort Ross), which existed in California in 1812-1841 as an outpost of the Russian-American company is considered. A general description of the population of the Ross colony, its distribution, and ethno-demographic structure in its dynamics is given. The author concludes that in Ross the diversity of the ethnic composition of the population was combined with its quite clear (although sometimes somewhat conditional) ethnosocial stratification according to the type common to all of Russian America, based on a combination of ethnic and vocational educational features. It is shown that the individual's place in this stratification was determined by the differentiation of the colonialists and indigene, the degree of cultural and state-political proximity to the colonial elite, the production qualifications, the form and amount of payment associated with it. The author identifies five ethno-social strata as part of the Ross population: the administrative elite; Russian workers ("industrial"), which the Finnish and Yakut adjoined to; creoles (mestizos) and natives "in the service of the Company"; Aleuts dependent on the Russian-American company (mainly Kodiak Eskimos); local Indians, who became the "foundation" of the social pyramid. The most fundamental differences between the strata and the sociohistorical nature of the system of exploitation of the Californian Indians are considered.

DE State archive; guide; Irkutsk gubernia; fonds; series; documents
AB The review of the new guide (2018) to the fonds of the State Archive of the Irkutsk Region (GAIO) assesses the information possibilities and fundamental differences of the latest edition from those published earlier (in 1949, 1965, 1975, 1987). It is noted that the guide is the best reference book on the structure and contents of the GAIO fonds. As usual, the edition is structured by branch, its sections are systematized by significance, as well as chronologically and alphabetically. According to the reviewers, the structure is fortunate, as it allows even unconfident researchers to find the required fonds, series, and files. The reviewers underscore that the latest edition includes extensive historical information prefacing each fond reference. These are essays in the history of Siberia, detailing historical events connected with social, political, economic, and cultural life of Eastern Siberia. Fonds included in the guide reflect special administrative role of Irkutsk, administrative and political center of Eastern Siberia from 1819 to 1917 and a stronghold for state advancement to the Far East, Transbaikalia, and Yakutia. A large part of the documents in the GAIO fonds covers the history of the "penal colonization," the activities of regional penal institutes, court, criminal police, and gendarmerie. Archival fonds are also an important source on the history of political exile. The new edition contains name and geographical indices that supplement and expand its materials. Having analyzed the contents of this volume, the reviewers conclude that it has been carefully and professionally made, and allows to add a new dimension to the history of Siberia, Baikal region. It will be in demand with professional researchers, as well as wide readership.

AB The article analyzes current German-Polish economic relations. The author considers the prospects of economic partnership and highlights key investment projects which include: the European Battery Alliance, transit, and energy issues. The author concludes that Germany is interested in intensifying economic relations with Poland and suggests that the growth of the geo-strategic importance of Poland as a transit country and industrial center in the medium term; in the short-term Poland potentially can enter the top-5 trading partners of Germany. In the future the innovative enterprises, primarily in the production of electric vehicles and components, will become a key element attracting FDI. German-Polish trade will continue to grow, increasing the country's chances to gain a foothold in Germany's first five trading partners in the next 5 years. The greatest contradictions affect the energy industry. On the one hand, Poland needs diversification of supplies, which could become a guarantee of energy supply, not vulnerable to sharp fluctuations in the global political situation. On the other hand, the economically manipulative actions of Poland in relation to the Russian supplier (a strategically important partner of Germany) impede German industrial development plans related to guaranteed supplies of Russian energy resources.

AB In this article, we address the little-researched and complicated problems of the genesis, periodisation, and development of political geography and geopolitics as academic and research disciplines across the Baltic region in general and the contribution of Saint Petersburg University in particular The terms 'political geography' 'geopolitics' and the corresponding academic disciplines, as well as the first concepts of political geography and geopolitics, emerged in the Baltic. The Russian and German schools of thought made a valuable contribution to these fields of research. Using the historical, structural-genetic, and activity-geospace approaches, we identify and analyse the major historical, research, and academic paradigms in the development of political geography. In doing so, we consider the case of Saint Petersburg University. These paradigms (state-descriptive, anthropo-geographical, state-geopolitical, and activity-societal) differ in their methodological frameworks and thematic priorities. We demonstrate that the term 'political geography' and the science it denotes are of Russian origin, having been developed by German scientists during their academic service for Russia. Further, we analyse the contribution of German and Russian researches to the development of the Saint Petersburg school of political geographic and geopolitical thought and describe its current state.

AB The history of Russian liberalism reflects the transformation of intellectual and political culture that took place in Russia from the eighteenth to the beginning of the twentieth century. The legacy of the Russian liberal thinkers requires close attention and study because it allows us to formulate the most important and relevant question: is the liberal project even possible in Russia? This chapter attempts to analyze the main ideas of the political philosophy of Russian liberalism and considers different national models of liberalism, such as those allowing for traditional cultural values, among other things. This analysis proposes a new intellectual tradition of Russian liberalism, as distinct from the Soviet version, and also introduces the reader to the historical-philosophical tradition of research on Russian liberalism from the eighteenth to the beginning of the twentieth century.

AB Today, when disappointment in cultural and social progress after the disasters and upheavals of the 20th century has not yet been overcome, new ways of understanding the role of science in society and culture have emerged, and questions about the vocation of the scientist are particularly acute. The report by M. Weber "Science as a Vocation" does not lose its relevance today. This is a problem testament of a thinker to many generations of scientists. It contains a controversial call for the value neutrality of science and states the inevitability of the scientist's appeal to the "last questions" of existence. The article deals with the existential problems, that received problematic coverage in M. Weber's report: the vocation of a scientist, the specifics of his professional activity, the specialization and essence of science, the specifics of scientific activity, etc. It is shown that for understanding the existential significance of science, Weber turned to the foundations of morality, which were formulated by L. Tolstoy. The author focuses on the value bases of scientific knowledge, as Weber formulated them, and shows that they are acquiring a special meaning today in the framework of interdisciplinary research. Weber is trying to bring science back to reality, believing that it will allow it to disengage from religion and idealistic philosophy. And this idea of Weber, as shown in the article, is also relevant today, when science is trying to perform its cognitive functions, separating itself from political and economic conditions.

DE Russia; Dagestan; religion; Protestants; neo-Protestants; social
   modernization; Evangelical mission
AB The transformation in Protestants' and neo-Protestants' values in their missionary practices in the modern Dagestan is discussed. It is noted that the processes of globalization caused by the international situation, the unfolding socio-economic, political and spiritual depression in the country contributed to the "influx" of Western missionaries and the emergence of new non-traditional charismatic churches, allowing them to occupy its niche in republic religious structure for some time. On the basis of sociological survey the analysis of value views of the Dagestan Protestants in their Evangelical mission is carried out. It is shown that the religious well-being of the adepts of the studied communities is focused on proselytizing and missionary activity among the carriers of the other worldview. It is established that the Dagestan Protestants positively evaluate proselytism with the motivation for its non-violent and peaceful propagation while simultaneously ignoring the possibility of aggravation of inter-religious and inter-ethnic relations. It is revealed that the respondents have different points of view on the promotion of their faith among representatives of other religions. The authors conclude that, on the one hand, the proclamation of the principles of freedom of choice of a religious worldview, on the other - the aim to emphasize the exclusivity of their beliefs with the motivation of its "perfection and correctness" allow to make conclusion about the contradictory nature of the respondents' opinions.

AB Based on hitherto unknown archive documents, the article reconstructs the processes undergoing in Soviet historical higher education in the period of perestroika in the latter half of the 1980s. Geographically, it encompasses the universities and higher education institutions of Siberia. The topic is relevant due to the paramount significance which the system of historical knowledge bears for the basic ideological constructs of the Soviet Union and modern Russia. In the hard and controversial conditions of perestroika higher school historians proved to be at the forefront of ideological, political, organizational and spiritual changes, transforming, once and for all, society and its historical consciousness. The regional specifics of transformations being underway in that period, largely, the seminal ones, are analyzed in the context of unique scientific, academic, social and cultural environments of Siberia. The distinctive features of the Siberian academe shaped the character and formal variety of its response to historic challenges. Due to this the epoch's major trends were reflected through Siberia's realities, destroying the old rules, on the one hand, and opening entirely new prospects, on the other.
   The major "perestroika-driven" changes affected primarily the methodological and historiographical aspects of history education at Siberian universities and higher education institutions. Methodological capacities were considerably expanded and historiographical ones were redefined. This facilitated a fast and fairly painless reintegration of the post-soviet academic community into the global one. The most vivid and substantial changes in higher historical education were demonstrated in the organization and contents of the training of historians. Changes affected the syllabus and methodology of historical education, the teaching staff and student contingent.

Nogmov and Khan-Giray - the Adyghe educators of the first half of the 19th c. - "The History of Adyghe People" and "Sketches on Cherkessia", respectively, in terms of their historiographical significance for the development of Russian Caucasology. The article shows that Nogmov relied on the folklore sources, Kabardian tales and legends in particular, and covered issues of the ethnogenesis of Adyghe people, religious affiliation, social structure and organization of Kabardian society. Khan-Giray has tried to use different types of sources: spoken, folklore, toponymic, linguistic but above all historiographical ones. He not only researched the origin of Adyghe tribes and their ethnonyms, the features of socio-political system and social differences, but also the specific nature of economic, spiritual and moral culture of the Adyghe people. The article also demonstrates the comparative analysis of the texts of the Adyghe educators among themselves as well as with the studies of scientists, travelers and representatives of the Russian administration in the Caucasus that existed at the time.

DT Article
DE Historical souces; demography; Southern Urals; population; birth rate;
   mortality; population change
AB In the study of demographic processes, regional approach is extremely important, as it allows to trace general patterns, as well as peculiarities in vital statistics. The article deals with vital statistics of the South Ural region in the period between official Soviet censuses of 1926 and of 1939; it studies both internal and external factors. General-logical methods of induction and deduction are used to consider vital statistics nationwide and in each subject of the Southern Urals as well. Historical methods (i.e., problem-chronological, historical-comparative) allow to conduct research in accordance with historical sequence and to identify main features of demographic processes in administrative divisions. General scientific and historical methods allow to study year-by-year vital statistics in the Orenburg and Chelyabinsk regions and the Bashkir Autonomous Republic. Inaccessibility of sources on the 20th century demography to most researchers has had its negative impact on the scientific view on Soviet vital statistics. The authors strive to identify features of vital statistics of the Southern Urals in 1920s-1930s. The case-study has proved that Soviet economic and political reforms of the period had a significant impact on the demographic balance in the Southern Urals. Year-by-year comparison of rural and urban population dynamics over 13 years between two censuses suggests compensatory natural movement of the population in the pre-war period. The authors conclude that intra-regional features can be associated with rapid development of industry in the Chelyabinsk region in the days of the pre-war five-year plans. It resulted in predominance of urban population over rural population in the Chelyabinsk region, in a radical departure from the tendency in agricultural areas of the Southern Urals (Bashkiria and the Orenburg region). The results of the study can be used in textbooks and monographs on demography, as well as in special courses on Russian demography or demography of the Southern Urals.

AB Michail N. Tukhachevsky is one of the key figures in the Soviet military leadership in the 1930s, even though contradictory enough. The persisting polarity of historiographic assessments of his role in the development of the Red Army in the period between the two world wars is another justification for this. While holding the top military posts of the head of the Red Army's General Staff and deputy People's Commissar for Military and Maritime Affairs, Tukhachevsky devised a Soviet military theory which laid the foundation for the Red Army's military warfare concept during the Great Patriotic War. This fact is even recognized by his opponents. What is far less known and studied is his contribution to the practical issues of the development of the USSR's armed forces in the pre-war period. Moreover, Tukhachevsky's views and activities in the area of development of specific troops and armaments are subject to him being accused of scheming and even sabotage.
   This article based on a series of archival documents analyses Tukhachevsky's contribution to the development of the Red Army's tank forces in the 1930s: it reconstructs his views concerning the role of tank forces in the future war and reveals his misconception and miscalculations in relation to certain aspects of tank warfare theory and development of tank forces. Particular emphasis is made on Tukhachevsky's vision of the structure of tank forces, tanks' technical characteristics, and the nomenclature of tanks of basic and special types. The dynamics and implementation of Tukhachevsky's views and solutions are examined in the context of the relationships among the country's top military and political officials with J. Stalin at the head.
   The author arrives at the well-grounded conclusion that among the USSR's military leadership in the 1930s Tukhachevsky was a chief expert in the theory of tank warfare. His key theoretical views proved to be correct providing for the employment by the Red Army of tank troops in the course of the Great Patriotic War. At the same time a number of miscalculations and mistakes were made by Tukhachevsky in both theoretical and technical issues.

AB The article examines the current relations between Japan and South Korea in the light of their common historical past. Specific problems rooted in the colonial domination of Japan on the Korean Peninsula in the first half of the 20th century are analyzed. Since the beginning of the 1990s, politicians and officials of both countries trying to solve these problems constantly stressed the need to build "relations oriented to the future" between the two nations. At the turn of the century, Japanese-South Korean relations were characterized by a certain rapprochement between Tokyo and Seoul. Its symbols were the joint holding of the World Cup in 2002, as well as the South Korean boom in Japan. However, this period did not last long, and recently the vector of bilateral relations is increasingly turning into their dramatic past. One of the most dramatic pages in Japan's relations with South Korea dates back to the Pacific War. It is related to the problem of "comfort women" - tens of thousands of young Korean women who were forcibly abducted during the Pacific War to Japanese frontline brothels. Among the problems that complicate relations between Japan and South Korea, the most intractable one is the territorial dispute over two small islands in the Sea of Japan, called Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in South Korea. Serious bilateral problems include Seoul's claims to name the Sea of Japan as the East Sea. In 2018, relations between Japan and South Korea sharply deteriorated due to the incident with the naval flag of Japan, the conflict over the guidance of a combat radar by a South Korean destroyer on a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft. Particular rejection in Japan was caused by the decision of the judicial authorities of South Korea to pay material compensation to its residents for forced labor during the war. The current deterioration of political relations between Japan and South Korea is alarming to the business circles of both countries. The article concludes that the growing tensions between Japan and South Korea are undermining the Japan-US-South Korea trilateral alliance and may lead to a change in the balance of power in Northeast Asia.

AB The article highlights challenges and responses to communication failures in politics and political science. In this context, the word translation refers to an adequate understanding of each other and oneself in political interactions. By its very nature, it is partial and relative. This ambiguity results from unsocial sociability (ungesellige Geselligkeit) as outlined by Kant, and corresponds to the principle of incompleteness of phenomena that triggers evolution (Deacon). Still, people at large associate many typical dysfunctions and losses in translation with ill will or technical errors rather than fundamental relativity of human communication. They readily endorse the illusion of one-to-one correspondence of phenomena, terms, their sense and reference. The authors examine the nature and parameters of translation and transfer providing examples like Parson's translation of Weber's stahlhartes Gehause as iron cage, as well as the interpretation of revolution, Europe and Eurasia, governance, polity, politics, policy, and police. Translation and interpretation expounds within fluid interfaces which embroil online political and communicative processes on the one hand and offline institutional and sign systems on the other. The ensuing relativity of translation, interpretation and transfer techniques allows the issue of variability and equivalence of terms and other tools of our communication and understanding to be reconsidered. Finally, the article outlines the format of the series "Lost in Translation".

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to the problem of forming the narrative on the history of the Don, Kuban and Terek Cossacks during the Civil war in the system of Istparts (Commissions on the history of the October revolution and the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)) of the North Caucasus. The experts had not only the task to write a "different" history of modern times, but also to form a historical narrative, which was to reflect the interpretation of events permitted by the authorities as the basis for a new model of historical memory. Creating the narrative in the operation system of Istparts determined the principles of selecting material and formulating key research issues. Methods and materials. The study is based on the methodology of "new local history". The author analyzes local historical narratives as images of the past created by Istparts of the North Caucasus with the help of discursive analysis. Analysis. The paper analyzes the interpretation of the Cossacks' history in the period of the socio-political crisis. It was found that in the 1920s the attention of researchers was focused on the search for class differentiation and struggle in the Cossacks' history. As a result, local historical narratives present an original interpretation of the Cossack stratification, which demonstrates the authors' desire to present the history of the Cossacks in accordance with the methodological instructions of the Commission on the history of the October Revolution and the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). At the same time, they reflect judgments that are not limited to the ideological paradigm. This is due to the fact that in local historical narratives it was not always possible to combine the peculiarities of the historical process in the region with the proposed scheme and settings of the center. In the 1930s, there was a change in substantial aspects of constructing a new model of historical memory and historical narrative as its basis associated with the assertion of Stalin's sole power. Published works were publicly criticized and banned. The authors of such works were repressed in the era of the Great terror. At this time there appeared new ideological interpretations of the Cossacks' history. Since 1936, the political campaign "for the Soviet Cossacks" had been reflecting in creating the narrative in the system of Istparts. Results. Scientific analysis of sources and coverage of complexity and ambiguity of the historical process in the region were replaced by simple but "correct" ideological statements. With the help of interpreting the past focusing research attention on class stratification and explanation of the Cossacks' place in the history of the Civil war a new image of the Cossacks was formed in public consciousness.

AB The American Committee for Liberation from Bolshevism was established as a public organization in 1951. Its aim was to assist the anti-communist emigration from the Soviet Union in its struggle to overthrow the Bolshevik regime. Americans generously financed anti-Soviet activities among European emigration. Their main "concern" was 250,000 former Soviet citizens living in West Germany in the status of displaced persons. The creators of the Committee deemed the Soviet emigres as one of their most important allies in the Cold War. The Committee intended to neutralize disconnection of the Soviet emigration by creating a central emigre organization in West Germany as the coordinating body in the anti-communist struggle. Such an integrated organization was to receive moral and material support from the Committee. In 1951-1952, the American Committee put a lot of effort into organizing and holding meetings of emigrant political associations that took place with its full financial support in the German cities of Fussen (January 1951), Stuttgart (August 1951), Wiesbaden (November 1951), Starnberg (June 1952). The final goal of creating a single anti-Bolshevik front among the emigration from the USSR was not achieved. However, the experience was significant. The committee gained good knowledge of the structure of emigration, its internal attitudes and problems. After the conference in Starnberg, the center of gravity in the work of the Committee's work with emigration was shifted to New York. Most of the conferences and all activities of emigration were relocated to Munich, where the Munich Institute for the Study of the USSR operated.

AB The subject. The subject. Historiography of the participation of the judicial authorities in mass repressions in Soviet Union in the 1930s-1950s.
   The purpose of the article is to confirm or disprove the hypothesis that the number of studies of the historical involvement of the judiciary in repression in recent years is increasing; researches cover more and more regions of the former USSR and help to create a complete picture of the special procedural law for political cases in Soviet Union in the 1930s-1950s. Methodology. The author uses historical legal method. The author analyses legal and historic literature, written by scientists who live in former USSR. Analysis of judicial statistics is used also.
   Results, scope of application. The history of the Soviet court remains the subject of active research interest at the present time. At the same time, special publications summarizing the entire body of scientific works on the participation of justice in mass repressions are not issued. A number of works on the history of the judicial authorities contain sections on the application of the rules of judicial procedure to political crimes. Currently, PhD theses, covering an increasing number of regions of Russia, are being defended actively. Unfortunately, some regional researchers are not familiar with the modern historiography of the judicial system and, therefore, repeats some of the conclusions that have been made before. Researchers are trying to formulate new approaches to assess the repressive policy of the Soviet state. For example, V.N. Karaman determines the repressions using political crite-rion. Researches that are not directly related to the history of judicial proceedings contain valuable information about the participation of courts in mass repressions often. Also, the group of researchers continues to develop the theme of rehabilitation of victims of political repression. New young researchers are emerging.
   We should also highlight a group of works on the historiography of mass repression. The appearance of such works is justified. A lot of research has accumulated for 70 years, which need to be generalized and systematized. Three of the PhD thesis, dedicated to the repression of the state security organs, five theses on the mass repressions, 14 theses on the camps during the war were defended during 1990-2010 in Siberia.
   The Russian-French seminars "Judicial political processes in the USSR and Communist countries of Europe: a comparative analysis of mechanisms and practices", held in 2009-2011, played an important role in summarizing the main problems of legal proceedings in political cases.
   Modern science continues to study various aspects of the application of criminal procedure for counter-revolutionary crimes. Scientists are exploring in detail the role of the j judicial authorities in conducting mass repressions in Soviet Union the 1930-1950s. Individual problems of political justice are considered in detail: types of political processes, rehabilitation procedures, official forgery, cassation on political affairs, etc. There are separate areas of activity of the judicial authorities, directed against certain groups of the population: military, intellectuals, party-soviet officials, peasants, etc. Regional studies continue to appear, reflecting the role of the judicial authorities in mass repressions.
   Conclusions. The judicial authorities are considered generally in the context of the activities of all repressive bodies in modern legal and historical scientific literature; researches cover more and more regions of the former USSR and may lead to a complete picture of the special procedural law in political cases in Soviet Union in the 1930s-1950s.

AB The presence of a great number of followers of Islam in Western Europe to a certain extent influences traditional values of the Old World. The situation that has been recently observed is a case in point. The migration is a global issue, affecting many regions of the world and most significantly Europe. States of the continent have become trapped by thousands of migrants from Syria, Africa, Afghanistan and Egypt.
   Islam imperceptibly introduces its own changes in the religion and daily activities of European people. Such rapprochement at the religious and social levels cannot but provoke a reaction among the indigenous population of the countries of Western Europe, expressed more often in a negative attitude towards the "newcomers". At the same time, Muslims of the second or third generation, born on the European soil can be considered Europeans on a par with the indigenous people.
   There is a transformation of European identity; Christianity gives way to the position of Islam. The problems arising at the junction of two cultures, two religions affect social and political aspects of life of Western European societies. Facing the choice of multiculturalism, Europe is trying not to lose its own traditions, but as long as the Western rulers, undecided, refuse to pursue an active integration policy, the number of Muslims in Europe increases and the mosques continue to grow in major European cities. This circumstance makes us look at the issues of the spread of Islam in Western Europe more widely. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

DT Article
DE S. I. Turgenev; pragmatics of travelling; Holland during the Napoleonic
   era; Napoleon in Amsterdam in 1811; Russian-Dutch cultural ties at the
   beginning of the 19th century; Russian liberalism; political values in
   the era of global changes
AB The article is the first to introduce into scholarly discourse the unpublished journal of S. I. Turgenev (1792-1827) from the Turgenev brothers' archive at the Institute of Russian Literature of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which is a unique collection of manuscripts related to the history of Russian-European cultural relations in the first half of the 19th century. Turgenev's journal dates back to 1811, when he, a young 'liberal,' a future diplomat, studied at the University of Gottingen and during his vacation travelled to 'French' Holland to see with his own eyes Napoleon, who arrived in Amsterdam almost at the same time as the Russian student. The deciphered text contains a lot of valuable observations about the everyday life of the Dutch people of that time, about the organization of socially important public institutions (hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, etc.), about the practical side of organizing travel for foreigners, and also includes reflections on the nature of political obedience, on optimal forms of government in general and for Holland in particular. Of special interest here is the description of the reception given by the people of Amsterdam to the French Emperor, whom the Russian traveller regards as the greatest conqueror and at the same time the greatest monarch. The journal allows us to trace how his first-hand observations become the basis for creating a personal image of Holland, which is further enriched and modified on the basis of information obtained from books (O. Goldsmith, A. Smith, etc.). The journal shows how all sorts of diverse impressions interact to form a significant intellectual arsenal of a Russian liberal, who is a convinced European. We can see how important this intellectual arsenal becomes for his further individual and professional development, as evidenced by the later journals of S. I. Turgenev, relating to 1815, when he served in Paris, as a member of the Russian expeditionary force, and worked on a draft constitution for Russia.

AB Introducing the concept of values politics (axiopolitics) as a set of methods of political "handling" of values (and their use for political purposes), the author offers his own typology of this phenomenon and outlines the main historical stages of its formation. Considering the values politics of the left-indigenist regime in Bolivia, he reveals its connection with the formation of nation and the incomplete process of modernization in the country. The article gives a description of the ideological and value complex, known as "Suma qamana", which underlies the axiopolitics of the Bolivian state. The concept is the quintessence of the traditional worldview of indigenous peoples of the Andean region. It includes the idea of harmonious coexistence of people with each other and with nature. The "Suma qamana" ideology openly opposes developmentalism as a paradigm of unidirectional development of mankind and consumerism, which orients economy to infinite increase in producing consumer goods. Its appearance was a reaction to the unsuccessful for Latin American countries policy of neoliberalism in the 1990s - early 2000s. The author reveals the content of the "Suma qamana" system of values and the essence of the arguments put forward by its critics. It is shown how the regime used the "Suma qamana" ideology to achieve its political goals.

TI PROBLEMS OF TRANSITION FROM TOTALITARIANISM TO DEMOCRACY IN THE WORKS OF
   THE FRENCH POLITICAL SCIENTIST AND SOCIOLOGIST RAYMOND ARON
SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE

DT Article
DE Raymond Aron; democracy; totalitarianism; problems of transition from
   totalitarianism
AB Many well-known scientists studied totalitarianism. The result of their research was the emergence of a number of global theories, including the creation of a theory of totalitarianism. Within the framework of these theories has been given the typology and characteristics of totalitarian regimes; the origins, formation and practice of one-party regimes have been studied in detail. Most of the researches were limited to the study of varieties of the totalitarian regime, a comparative analysis of modes within a single theory. Raymond Aron was one of the few scientists who studied not only the theory and practice in detail, and as one of the pioneers of the theory of totalitarianism gave a description of these regimes, but also thought about the future of the existing regimes.
   The purpose of the article is to show the view of the famous French sociologist and political scientist Raymond Aron on the problems of transition from totalitarianism to democracy. The sources of research were the works of the French scientist, devoted to the analysis of known regimes. The brightest of them are "Democracy and Totalitarianism", "Class Struggle", "History of the Twentieth Century", "Memoirs", "Stages of Development of Sociological Thought", "Opium of Intellectuals", "Biased Viewer".
   A red thread through all the works of Aaron is the idea of the danger of "slipping into totalitarian" constitutional-pluralistic regimes (like the Western democracies). He admits that this danger is very real, and not a possible alternative. Based on a real threat, the scientist identifies and gives a detailed description of the characteristic features of various modes. Matching and comparing them with each other, he finds the weaknesses of each of them. And he reflects on the possible future of each of them. Speaking about democratic regimes, he states that the likelihood of coming to power, at various stages of its historical development, of one-party governments is very high, but believes that this is only a temporary and necessary step. As for the alternatives of totalitarian regimes, the scientist's forecasts here are not so unambiguous and optimistic. Especially in relation to the Soviet regime.
   R. Aron believes that there are only two versions of the development of events. The first is the forcible overthrow of the existing regime from the outside, as happened with the national-socialist and the second is the changes within the regime itself, not excluding radical, such as revolutions and coups.
   In this way, the French sociologist and political scientist made a solid contribution to the study of various types of regimes, considered various theories and schemes for the transformation of totalitarian regimes. He outlined the main problems of getting out of totalitarianism. Raymond Aron's study represent a significant value to the world of science.

AB In the beginning of the 20th century, China faced the need to look for new ways of development and, like other countries, turned towards the resources provided by social sciences in the attempt to comprehend and interpret this experience. This article reviews and analyzes Chinese sociological thought of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, focusing on management issues. The subject of this work is the genesis of management ideas in sociology in Chinese society. The material for the study comprises the works of thinkers, publicists, and political figures of that time who set themselves the task of applying sociological theories to the development of the country. The main problem discussed in the article is the ratio of Western and native Chinese views and ideas in sociological approaches to the study of managerial processes in China. The analysis of materials from that time shows three different tendencies in the formation of management ideas in sociology ; identifying the prerequisites for a new science to be used in traditional ideas about management, demonstrating the predominance of Western science over Chinese traditional sciences, and the attempts at synthesizing the first two tendencies. The conclusion of the article is that, by the time of the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, the nascent management ideas in sociology in China were a heterogeneous fusion of Western and traditional Chinese concepts, and was closely related to other sciences such as political science, sociology, philosophy, etc. During this period, traditional ideas that were largely distinguished by speculation and ideology bore the function of an ideological "shield" to preserve the integrity of the Chinese nation in the context of the growing influence of Western powers on Chinese society.

AB Introduction. The study of historical memory has recently become one of the most relevant research areas. The Time of Troubles of the early 17th century is one of the most acute socio-political crises in the history of the country which has been arousing the interest of many historians. At the same time, the features of reflecting events and participants of the Time of Troubles in various forms of historical memory are becoming the subject of special studies. Methods and materials. The authors used the institutional approach, general scientific methods of logical analysis, the comparative historical and problem chronological methods, the situational analysis. The article is based on the authors' field observations, historiographic sources and mass media publications. Analysis. Three periods can be distinguished in the memorialization of events and participants of the Time of Troubles: pre-revolutionary, Soviet, and post-Soviet. They are closely related to the periods in the history of the Russian and Soviet states and the policy of memory. In addition, each of them is divided into two stages. Results. In the 17th - 18th centuries, honoring events, heroes and martyrs of the Time of Troubles took religious forms. In the 19th century, the policy of memory was separated from the church and became an independent area of activity. But its dependence on the state was increasing, especially in the era of Nicholas I's reign. This was evidenced by forming the cult of Susanin. The largest ideological campaign of imperial Russia which caused a significant increase in the number of memorial events and objects dedicated to the Time of Troubles was the celebration of the 300th anniversary of the House of Romanov. After the revolution of 1917, a program of monumental propaganda was implemented. It included overthrowing old monuments of the monarchy and establishing new ones, including ones dedicated to popular movements and their leaders, and Bolotnikov was one of them. Closing and destructing temples acquired a massive character. It involved temples dedicated to the Time of Troubles as well. But since the late 1930s, Soviet policy of memory returned to patriotic principles, which led to creating new monuments to Susanin, Minin and Pozharsky. The modern period in the Soviet policy of memory development is characterized by restoring destroyed temples and erecting new monuments to participants of the Time of Troubles, including those who were "omitted figures". National Unity Day gave a significant impetus to creating memorial objects in honor of the events and heroes of the Time of Troubles. Monuments of regional and local significance appeared in many places. They were designed not only to "fit" the fate of a particular locality into the general history of the country, but also to make it more attractive for tourists.

TI Napoleon and Royer-Collard
SO FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL

DT Article
DE Royer-Collard; French spiritualism; Napoleon; "ideologists"; philosophy
   of Enlightenment; the intellectual culture of the first Empire in France
AB The paper explores Napoleon's attitude towards the philosophical controversies of his time and to the spiritualism that was taught at the Imperial University. Napoleon's ideological evolution, and the extent to which he was acquainted with the philosophical ideas of his epoch is also discussed. In light of Napoleon's praise of Royer-Collard's philosophy, the author looks for the object of Napleon's approval in the new system. The author suggests that it was the general orientation against "ideologists" (something Napoleon acknowledged in his communication with Talleyrand). Not only the orientation against "ideologists" was important for the emperor, but also the way in which it was established: flawless, inescapable, refined. It is argued that Napleon could approve of Royer-Collard's arguments about the incompleteness of the knowledge of man that sensualists possessed, the limitations of their theory of the ideas, and their inability to justify virtue with their own principles. Among other possible reasons behind his approval are Royer-Collard's attacks on the lack of clarity, the metaphorical and hypothetical character of many philosophical assumptions of the "ideologists", his appeals for their expulsion from science, the demand to rely only on established facts. Finally, Royer-Collard's ontological scheme - matter, soul, God - was not in opposition to the emperor's worldview. It is remarkable that Royer-Collard, as any other university professor of his time, found it possible to derive the existence of God from the overall collection of the phenomena observed by the man. Napoleon proved to be right in his prediction of the fall of the school of "ideologists" and its replacement by the contemporary spiritualist ideas. However, his political ideas, which the emperor also thought to be important, never became an incentive either for Royer-Collard or for other philosophers, who valued his thinking and were inspired by it. Of course, the philosophy in its development is subject to the influence of social factors, but it can't be completely reduced to a political calculation.

DE National religion of Ossetians; religious mindset; remythologization
AB The article uses current empirical and theoretical data to analyze the phenomenon of contemporary remythologization of national religion of the Ossetians and its transformation into neoethnical one. The work determines the reasons (mainly political ones) of this process, its character and results, as well as possible threats it bears. The processes of ethnoreligious revival currently proceed for many folks in the world, in particular in Western Europe. As a rule, in the revival of Rodnovery (Slavic Native Faith) the disciples see the way to save ethnical identity in the globalizing world. On the other hand, the ethoreligious remythologization is accompanied by aggression against dogmatic world religions. The work implements interdisciplinary approach to make a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon of national religion of the Ossetians and the process of its remythologization under the conditions of globalization. The main characteristics are determined, as well as actors, internal and external factors of the remythologization of the national religion of the Ossetians. The current theoretical and empirical data are used to forecast the potential social, cultural and political risks of remythologization and politicization of ethnical and religious mentality of the Ossetians in the context of conflictogenic ethnopolitical situation on North Caucasus and challenges of globalitarian world.

AB The article explores the socio-economic consequences of the migration boom, which Spain encountered at the beginning of the XXI century. The immigrants inflow from other countries and regions, especially from Latin America, contributed to the emergence of new migration pattern of the country: Spain developed a new characteristic feature, being a recipient of migration. In 2000s, immigration played an important role in boosting economic growth. The mass migration inflow led to the growing rate of new jobs creation and contributed to the development of various sectors of economy. The Spanish case largely confirms the basic patterns of migrants employment typical of the countries with a long migration history. The migratory turbulence has been accompanied by increasing illegal migration. Spain is a border country of the EU, that raises the importance of the southern Maritime borders security and the development of cross-border mobility control systems. Being involved in the Western Mediterranean route of illegal migration, Spain faces the increasing inflow from North and sub-Saharan Africa. The implementation of bilateral and multilateral projects and agreements has contributed to the mobility control at the sea border of the country. However, Spain feels the pressure caused by the European migration crisis comparable to other States of the Mediterranean region.

DE international relations; Nesselrode; Austria; Vienna system; Metternich;

AB The article is devoted to the relations of two distinguished statesmen of the Vienna System period - Austrian Chancellor Metternich and Russian Chancellor Nesselrode. They took the helm of the foreign affairs of the allied states for a long period of time - their cooperation lasted almost 40 years. Russian-Austrian union was based on concurrence in their political views regarding the Concert of Europe, adherence to the principles of legitimacy, conservatism and hostility to revolution and remained until the Crimean War. According to estimates of historians, Nesselrode was just an obedient apprentice of the Austrian Chancellor who orchestrated the whole European policy. Adherence to the principles of conservatism and The Holy Alliance resulted in nothing but misfortunes of Russian foreign policy and its submission to the "European Idea". Austria benefited from this and therefore Nesselrode was called "Russian foreign minister in the service of Austria". However documents witness that Nesselrode being an adept of Metternich's doctrine wasn't just a blindfolded follower of all Austrian initiatives. He could stand his ground in face of difficult European politics. In his way he faithfully served Russia and Nicolas the I.

The latter are traced in accordance with the ten key stages of the Union's development: from the "Introductory", at which the Western European Union (WEU) was established, to the "Heroic", marked by the solemn celebration of the 70th anniversary of the signing of the Rome Treaty, establishing the European Economic Community, which became the basis for EU in its current form. It is argued that the process of self-justification of the European Union as a political association, in its logic, reproduces the search for the justification of science, which received the common name the Munchhausen trilemma.
   It is showed that the desired philosopheme is formed in the process of the dialectic of Existing and Due, germinating in this process historically and acquiring universality and "closeness" as a result of this process. The limits of the effectiveness of this philosopheme have been discovered. It is shown that, in times of crisis, the key determinant of the philosophy of the history of the EU, in order to remain working, have to be constantly subjected to verification, confirmation and correction, to get the "open" character. The article also provides a general description of the history of philosophy as an academic discipline, its main vectors and trends, forming a conceptual methodological platform for the entire body of philosophical and historical research.

DE cultural cooperation; SCO development strategy; Silk Road Economic Belt;

AB The article contains analysis of those sections of the SREB concept and the SCO Development strategy which are devoted to the humanitarian cooperation. The author shows that both program documents presume establishment and application of conununication platforms based on the experience of different civilizations and different cultures in order to form and stimulate various spheres of interaction, and to become an important element of the substantial development of each member State.
   There have been created mechanisms of Ministerial meetings within the SCO framework. These mechanisms seem applicable for the Silk Road Economic Belt as well. They can lead to the synergy' effect, when value of common achievements exceeds the effect of "simply" summarized efforts of all participant parties. Therefore, the results achieved here make a more tangible contribution to the joint construction of a new and just world order. Political leadership of the two countries demonstrates common strive to give the humanitarian cooperation a stable and long-term character of sustainable interaction.
   Chinese Belt and Road Initiative concept includes special sections describing the development of the humanitarian cooperation. Much attention is given to the promotion of mutual understanding and approximation of different civilizations, which can contribute to the creation of called "social basis" of the SREB. The powerful ideological component of the SREB is represented by its cultural and civilizationalbasis. The experience of the Ancient silk road made it possible to unite many States within a single format; even those of them which significantly differ in their political regimes and level of economic development. Therefore, the concept of the SREB may be represented as an economic initiative and cultural-humanitarian integration project as well.
   The author comes to the conclusion that the emphasis on humanitarian ties, which can be traced in the above mentioned program documents, is an independent vector and a manifestation of so called "soft power" in the promotion of SREB and SCO politics aimed at the formation of a positive image of individual member States and integration associations as a whole. The article also identities the integration opportunities arising from the humanitarian cooperation within the framework of the SREB and the SCO.

   Shrine; public opinion; China's image; business environment in China;
   interaction of economics and politics
AB Despite the strong economic gravity between Japan and China, there are still many social factors that pull the countries away from each other. One of such factors is the negative image of the partner, which is largely related to the memory of World War II.
   Perception of China in Japanese society has been changing over the post-war decades. After Japan's surrender and occupation of the country by the Allied Powers, political, economic, and cultural distance between the two countries grew. This led to a "lapse of memory" related to China among the post-war generation of the Japanese. Interest towards China in Japan started growing after some time had passed since the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations (1972) - from late 1980s-early 1990s, as the contacts between the countries on different levels became more and more active.
   The image of China in Japan deteriorated dramatically for the first time after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, which demonstrated that China was an unsafe country with a repressive state machine. The attitude of Japanese society to China has been worsening since then for various reasons. Starting from the 1990s, new problems emerged, including the struggle for geopolitical influence, global competition, pollution of environment and bad quality of Chinese products, problems of communication with Chinese business partners, growing number of Chinese tourists in Japan, etc. As Sino-Japanese relations became more complicated, the problem of historical memory emerged more and more vividly. This problem fits into the whole picture of controversies accumulated in the Sino-Japanese relations and intensifies some of them.
   Despite the unfavorable perception of China by the Japanese society, signs of improvement can be seen in the last few years, especially among the younger generation. Many young Japanese view China and the prospects of developing bilateral relations positively. Contacts with China give more opportunities to understand this country better, and close economic ties make the influence of political factors less obvious.

AB The aim of the study is to form modern scientific views on regional economic security in a multiethnic region, taking into account new political and socio-economic challenges. The peculiarity of the study is that it is conducted at the intersection of theories of economic security, regional economy, ethnopolitical law and is aimed at the development of scientific methods for assessing the regional economic security of a multi-ethnic region.
   The object of the study was the Republic of Kalmykia, which is home to representatives of 100 nationalities, three relatively large ethnic and religious communities (Buddhists, Orthodox, Muslims). Data tomonitoring, the survival of the inhabitants of the Republic suggests favorable ethnic climate in the region.
   The subject of the study is the economic security of a multi-ethnic region. Developed methodological and theoretical methods of assessment of economic security, justified by the specificity of the multi-ethnic regions as objects of regional economic security.
   The evaluation of socio-economic indicators and identified destructive factors that determine the threat to economic security. The economic security of the region should be based on the interests of the population, stability (absence of crisis situations in the economy), security (availability of measures to counter crisis situations in the economy and social sphere).
   An interdisciplinary approach will improve the methodology and provide the opportunity to make management decisions at the regional level in order to ensure economic security and the development of interethnic relations in their relationship.

DT Editorial Material
DE "multidimensional" and "one-dimensional" philosophy; moral; religious
   and political philosophy; problems and prospects of interfaith dialogue
AB This article discusses the contribution of contemporary philosophical discussions into the process of determining the basic forms of philosophy, which are referred to here as the "unidimensional" and the "multidimensional." The unidimensional is a form of philosophy associated with the desire to create a universal philosophy based on a limited number of methods of thinking and behavioral patterns. The multidimensional is a form that assumes the existence of various methods and techniques based on the diversity of the original "cultural substrate," economic and political practices as well as forms of thinking. Multidimensionalism does not reject universalism, but rather views it as an object of research (the universality of human nature, its plasticity and desire for interaction). The article explores the discussions of certain areas of moral, religious and political philosophy. These discussions target the possibility of transcendental sources of ethics, natural theories of law, non-religious rational ethics, the essence of God and the identity of God as God, the problems and prospects of an interconfessional dialogue, tolerance and faith in the context of religious practice of existence. The authors also focus on the comparative use of the metaphors of light and darkness in the West and in the East as well as the role of metaphors in an axiomatic systems. They point at an existing trend to include the achievements of non-Western philosophies into the toolbox of a contemporary researcher (e.g. Garfield, van Norden).

AB In the present work the phenomenon of alienation, accompanied the modern formal social contracts - constitutions, is studied. The constitution, considered a formal social contract, is a legal act of alienation of the civil society and the governmental authority under the certain terms. In the context of methodology of the legal political science (the political science of law), the system comparative analysis of major features of alienation and de-alienation, corresponding to the constitutions of bourgeois - democratic, socialist, post-socialist, theocratic and clerical states, is performed. In the work a historical - materialistic approach, according to which the natural state (the interpretation of primitive living) and the social contract (the act of alienation of people's rights to the benefit of the establishing state), is used - the necessary fictions of anti-feudal natural legal theory, formulated in the Enlightenment. In practice the modern states define the people's rights and the "government's", provide for the opportunities of flexible alienation and de-alienation of all the constituted social relations through the formal social contract - the Constitution. This logical scheme constitutes modus operandi of all the study, in the result of which the author came to the conclusion that different types and forms of alienation are immanent to the social contracts (constitutions) of the countries with various social and political system; the ways of constitutional de-alienation are various as well: modernization of the system of rights and freedoms, social guarantees, state-party and state-religious ideology, etc. This process is relatively unlimited, determined by the civilizational features of societies, but, mainly, by the progress of productive forces and productive relations, the inevitable revolutionizing of which raises new issues of alienation and de-alienation on the way to the common good of humanity.

AB The article is devoted to the formation of the image of such a phenomenon as the "Red Threat" in the literary work of FBI Director John Edgar Hoover. It is affirmed that a special position in the US executive power system, along with a certain popularity in the 30-50s of the 20th century, made Edgar Hoover and his ideas significant both for the internal political life of the United States and, to some extent, for the foreign policy of this country. It is emphasized that the publication "Masters of Deceit: the history of communism in America and how to deal with it" has become for its time an important ideological and political-philosophical basis in the formation of a powerful anti-communist movement in the United States against the backdrop of the Cold War. It is noted that this book is of interest from the point of view of analyzing howAmerica's major anti-communists understood the term communism, the history and essence of classical Marxism, Marxism-Leninism, the revolution in Russia and the changes that occurred in Soviet Russia after it, Stalinism and its consequences. It is indicated that the author of the book not only analyzes the most important moments in the history of world and Russian communism, but also tries to understand how the communist ideology has developed in the USA, who the American communists are, what their goals are, etc.

AB The article analyzes domestic and foreign historiographic sources, examining the concept of inclusion of the Kalmyks into the Russian state. Special attention is paid to the legal status of the Kalmyk Khanate and Kalmyk Steppe in the 17th to 19th centuries in the context of relations between the center and the national periphery throughout the integration of the region into the common Russian political landscape. The case study of Kalmykia provides an insight into the then state policies towards national peripheries, the policies basically including mixed elements of unitarianism and federalism, i.e. no actual autonomies were afforded within the country's borders, national territories - following the traditional framework - being designated with issues of internal self-governance only, the latter to nominally sustain the form of a national-and-territorial autonomy. The paper concludes that the integration of Kalmyk Steppe into Russia during the 19th century can be viewed as an organized acculturation process initiated by the central Government, key means and methods having been developed by regional and local officials.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE I. G. Burtsov; J. Locke; I. Kant; philosophy of war; military science;
   the Decembrist movement
AB The paper studies I. G. Burtsov's philosophical ideas. Burtsov was one of the main representatives of the Decembrist movement and a respected specialist in military theory. In his youth, Burtsov was greatly influenced by the philosophy of the Enlightenment, and especially of J. Locke. This was because the organization of teaching in the Moscow Noble Boarding School, where Burtsov studied, was based on Locke's pedagogy and philosophy. After the Napoleonic wars, Burtsov engaged in active military education and theoretical research in the philosophy of war and military science. His active work occurred in the period for choosing the further development of Russian military science. In continental Europe in the first quarter of the nineteenth century there were two main schools of military thought: the Prussian and the French. The development of Burtsov's ideas would allow Russian military science to develop as an original branch of European military thought. Burtsov wrote his main theoretical work, Thoughts on the theory of military knowledge, in 1819 after private lessons with professors of St. Petersburg University, most of whom were followers of Kant's critical philosophy. Some Kantian ideas we find in Burtsov's works and in letters. Synthesizing the ideas of Locke, Kant, and famous European military thinkers, Burtsov created an original philosophical basis for the development of military science. This foundation was unclaimed because of a radical change in the social and political life of Russia in 1825.

AB The central objective of this paper is to find out the different aspects of Dagestani polities in 7th-10th centuries: the territorial, the ethnic, and the political, thus to enhance and further develop our understanding of the historical geography of Eastern Caucasus. Here in the Middle Ages were located Sarir, Lakz, Filan, Shandan, Masqat, Khayzan, Bab al-Abvab, Khazaria, etc. This paper represents the first attempt at a thorough study of the excerpts from Arabic geographical source Kitab al-Buldan by Ibn al-Faqih on medieval history of Eastern Caucasus through translation, commentary and comparative analysis. This work gives a brief description of different polities: indicating trade routes, distances between towns etc. sort of the administrative directory, and thus considered as the geographical descriptive work, which contains brief information on Dagestan. The paper discusses the main aspects of life and scholarly activities of Ibn al-Faqih, who was an expert in Islamic history and Arabic geography. He mainly outlines the history of Muslims; describes the administrative structure and tax system in the Caliphate; gives detailed the list of routes and distance between polities existed in Eastern Caucasus. In the given research paper the author conducted comparison of the information on Dagestan within the works of Ibn al-Faqih's Kitab al-Buldan and Ibn Khordadbeh's Kitab al-masalik wa-l-mamalik in order to find out whether the origin of the material is the same for both authors. More broadly, a major emphasis of the study is placed on interpretation of the place names cited by both Arab medieval authors, and comparison and critical analysis of the accounts widely used by non-Arabic-speaking authors on Dagestani medieval toponymy. The author's main argument is that the value of corpus of Arabic sources is that it contains important historical information for the studying of medieval Eastern Caucasus (Dagestan) social, political and economic history. The results of the research will greatly enrich researchers' understanding of the peculiarities of the early medieval historical geography of Dagestan. Until now, no significant attention has been given to the study of historical geography of Dagestan in Arabic source Kitab al-Buldan of Ibn al-Faqih.

TI A LEFTIST THEORY OF THE AUTHORITARIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC STATE
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE state; democracy; social-democracy; Karl Marx; Miguel Abensour
AB The article explores the notion of the State: first, as a philosophical concept; second, as a topic in the current socio-political discussion of democratization and globalization; and third, as a possible element of a left wing ideological program. In the prevailing understanding, the State is a regrettable technical necessity that should be kept to a minimum and that will gradually expire by itself. Both the orthodox and the Althusserian Marxists agree with liberals and neo-liberals on this. Their value preferences fuse with their diagnosis of actual tendencies. However, the article claims that, from the current leftist, social-democratic and post-Marxist point of view, the State is becoming stronger but there is nothing bad in that.
   This post-Marxist point of view coincides with the position of Karl Marx himself when he was a young man planning to write a critique of the State. That project was never completed, but what we have of it, A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, shows that a truly democratic state itself constitutes democratic society and thus forms a circle of mutual establishment and mutual authorization. The democratic form becomes the content; and everyone takes part in self-government, while socio-economic institutions in turn acquire a political nature. The article concludes with a brief account of the principles for the constitutional structure of such a state.

TI Stanislav Andreski: Initial Assumptions of Sociology of Ignorance

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Stanislav Andreski; sociology of ignorance; charlatanry in science
AB The name of Stanislav Andreski (1919-2007) is rarely mentioned in Russian works on social philosophy. This is attributed, in part, to his quite critical conceptual assessments of the state of modern social and human sciences. His harsh assessments are based on the direct appeals to the socio-political and humanitarian reality of the 20th century - the fact which explains the main reason for the unpopularity of his criticism. He devoted his life to the critical analysis of ideas of the classics of sociology (M. Weber) in the context of wars, revolutions, dictatorships and other catastrophes of the last century.
   This article attempts to assess the methodological effectiveness of the approach presented in Andreski's works to modern sociology which is built on the reflections of his generation on the social reality of that time. Moreover, the author of the article justifies the idea that historical experience of Andreski's generation and the focus of the conceptual generalizations present also an undoubted existential, research and methodological interest to us living in a not so tragic, but nevertheless quite stormy era.

DE politics of memory; mnemonic actor; official historical narrative;

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the practice of forming and articulating the official historical narrative in contemporary Russia on the basis of three cases that make it possible to trace the interactions between various groups involved in constructing the narrative. The study of the thematic repertoire of the commemorative speeches allows to trace in the speeches of the head of state the result of the collective work of the Presidential Administration. The author shows that the formation of the memory infrastructure supporting the official narrative of the thousand-year Russia became more or less systematic only under Putin's third presidential term. The 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution of 1917 provides an interesting platform for studying the discussions within the ruling elite. The analysis of the preparation process for the commemoration reveals a certain competition of opinions at the decision-making stage and the Presidential Administration's desire to balance them. Given the weak consistency of the official historical narrative, this pattern might be typical for the events, the interpretation of which has not taken shape and/or is not subject to securitization. The transcripts of the meetings of Presidents Putin and Medvedev with the "historical community" - scientists and teachers - give an idea of the nature of the interaction between the authorities and the academic community. The study of these transcripts indicates that the recent years witnessed the development of stable practices of interaction between the state and the historical establishment about the official narrative.

DT Article
DE Eastern Siberia; training of teachers; profession; teacher; commuity
AB In the article, the process of the teachers' community establishment in Eastern Siberia at the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the 20th century is considered. The historiographic analysis shows that the teaching environment as a subject of research is analyzed from different points of view. In the context of the contemporary investigations of the modern historical science, numerous works on both the position of a teacher and social organizations in the system of education are published. The main aim of the article is to analyze the formation of the teachers' community in Eastern Siberia within the framework of the conception of local communities. Using all the approaches of the theory, the author analyzed the consolidation of the teaching environment. The process had its long history. It is emphasized that the teaching environment had a differentiated character in terms of its professional development. On the basis of regulatory legal acts, it was determined that one of the major factors which made the members of the community become closer and friendly was the system of promotion in rank and the inclusion of the profession of a teacher in the system of state service. The regional features of the teachers' community were presented in the state program which concerned teachers of remote regions, including Eastern Siberia. On the basis of the analysis of archive materials first used in science, the appearance and the activity of teachers' social organizations were investigated. It is established that charitable organizations that granted financial support to teachers were widely spread. In the second decade of the 20th century, the targeted charity of organizations transformed into the methodological and professional activities to support young teachers. A considerable attention was paid to the communicative environment and ways of interaction of members of the teachers' community. It is found that the interpersonal communication between teachers was hard because settlements and schools were located at long distances from each other. The basic ways of the interaction between teachers were short-time classes and social organizations. A special way of interaction within the community was the high degree of political activity of primary school teachers. As a result of the investigation, it was concluded that before the revolution in 1917 the teaching environment in Eastern Siberia had characteristic traits of the regional teachers' community.

DE Chechens; attitude; extremism; terrorism; Islam
AB Counteracting efforts of extremism and terrorism remains among priorities of a number of regions of Russia. The article dwells on traditional attitude of the Chechens to a person based on respect for his natural and social rights, the recognition of his highest value, regardless of origin, nationality, religion and other circumstances. The ideology and practice of the attitude of extremists and terrorists towards a person is marked by intolerance towards those who disagree with them. In fact, Islam is distorted by extremists and terrorists themselves, and in this form they use this religion in order to achieve their main goal.
   The traditional attitude of the Chechens to sociocultural, moral and ethical values, to a person, his rights and life has undergone significant deformation during the dominance of religious and political extremism in Chechnya in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which caused the disintegration and division of society, hostility and conflicts between individual people and their groups. A person and his life itself were devalued. Activities and goals of extremists and terrorists are alien to the mentality of the Chechens, their historically established attitude towards a person.
   The article also shows that the traditional attitude of the Chechens towards a person is essentially identical to the Islamic one. Along with other resources to counter extremism and terrorism, it is important to know and consciously use in anti-extremist propaganda the formation of understanding the essence and immunity against these phenomena with their pseudo-romanticism, deception and false promises.

AB The article discusses the crisis around Iran in three different contexts - local, regional and global. It is shown how the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps achieved its current power and determines the foreign and almost all domestic policy of Iran. An explanation is offered of how US actions on the international scene since 2001 contributed to strengthening position of this organization. An assessment is given of the strategy of action of a number of Middle Eastern adversary states of the Islamic Republic through the prism of their domestic political situation and regional situation. A comparative analysis of the actions of B. Obama and D. Trump administrations makes it possible to reveal differences in their approaches to Iran. For the first time the interconnectedness of the ongoing Trade War against China and the systemic pressure of D. Trump administration on Iran in the form of a multi-level non-classical war where these countries are regarded as two target objects is revealed. A scenario approach is presented in predicting the military and political situation around Iran in the near and medium term.

AB The article is devoted to the current process of the Russian educational system modernization. The crucial task of the Russian educational policy is to ensure the modern quality of education based on preserving its fundamental nature and compliance with the current and future needs of the individual, society and the state. Modernization of education is a political and national task; it should not and cannot be carried out as a departmental project. The interests of society and the state in the field of education do not always coincide with the sectoral interests of the educational system itself, and therefore the determination of the educational modernization directions cannot be locked in the framework of the educational community and the educational department. All Russian citizens, the family and the parent community, federal and regional state institutions of power, local governments, the professional and pedagogical community, scientific, cultural, commercial and public institutions should become active subjects of educational policy. The educational modernization goal is to create a mechanism for the sustainable development of the education system.
   To achieve this goal, the following interrelated tasks will be solved as a matter of priority:
   state guarantees of accessibility and equal opportunities for obtaining a full-fledged education;
   achievement of a new modern pre-school, general and vocational education quality;
   formation of legal organizational and economic mechanisms for attracting and using extrabudgetary resources in the education system;
   improving the social status and professionalism of educators, strengthening their state and public support;
   development of education as an open state-public system based on the responsibility distribution between the subjects of educational policy and the increasing role of all participants in the educational process: the student, teacher, parent, educational institution.
   The basis of the modern educational state policy is formed by socially targeted and balanced social interests. The strategic educational modernization goals can be achieved only in the process of constant interaction of the educational system with representatives of the national economy, science, culture, health care, all interested departments and public organizations, with parents and employers. The implementation of the education modernization affects almost every Russian family. The essence of changes in education, their goals, directions, methods should be regularly explained to the population, and the results of public opinion should be closely studied by education authorities and heads of educational institutions and taken into account when modernizing education.

AB In this paper we present a model of dynamics of political preferences considering current economic situation and expected changes. The model is agent-based and represents demographic structure and economy of the Russian Federation. Political system in the model is democratic, consisting of Legislative and Executive. Legislative is multiparty; each party proposes a pre-election program to attract voters. Agents are grouped into clusters that are homogeneous in political preferences. Belonging to the cluster determines issues of pre-election programs that are important for the agent. Agents implement concept of retrospective economic voting, for this they keep a record of their subjective estimates of living standards in previous periods. After elections Legislative and Executive are formed. Legislative proposes laws and approves structure of the state budget. Executive implements measures of state social, monetary and economic policy that affect organizations and population.

DT Article
DE post-war period in Japan; American occupation; Mishima Yukio;
   censorship; Japanese intelligentsia; Japanese writers; Japanese fascism
AB The article is devoted to Mishima Yukio's perception of the transformations of the Japanese state in the early postwar period. There are relatively few studies concerning the peculiarities of the writer's political views in historiography. Basically, the researchers turn to the analysis of the works created by him in the 1960s, when the writer turns to the far-right version of patriotism. In this period, Mishima begins to manifest himself in the political life of Japan. He meets with representatives of student movements who organize large-scale demonstrations in Tokyo, establishes and trains his own military-political organization "Shield Society" in 1968.
   For a comprehensive study of Mishima's early political views, the author chooses the essay "The Reasoning on the New Fascism" (1954). Mishima wrote the essay two years after the end of the occupation of Japan. The essay marked the beginning of political reflections of the writer. In the essay, the writer reflected on the phenomenon of Japanese fascism. Creative intelligentsia of this period actively participated in political discussions. Exponents of leftist ideas quickly gained popularity among the intelligentsia and the public. They resumed the political debate that had faded due to new censorship restrictions introduced under the American occupation, including that on the theme of fascism. In his essay, Mishima Yukio tries to refute the opinion of the Japanese Communists about the possibility of revival of fascist ideas in Japan. The essay "The Reasoning on the New Fascism" is a theoretical work and does not contain the political motives characteristic of the later activities of Mishima. Translation of the essay "The Reasoning on the New Fascism" into Russian language has been made by the author of this article.

In his methodology the author follows models of modern sociology, social psychology and political science.

SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE USA; Weimar Republic; democracy; parliamentarism; separation of powers;
   imperial presidency; Trump; populism
AB The dramatic change in the political climate in the United States after the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential elections sparked a heated debate in the intellectual circles about the nature, historical foundations and the future of the American democracy. The discussion centers on the topic of a "suicide of democracy", with the collapse of the Weimar Republic in Germany being its classic example, and the prospects for the Weimar scenario in the United States.
   From the Political Science viewpoint, the content of this discussion is of interest in at least three respects. First, it captures the truly significant changes in the American political system, indicating qualitative, if not irreversible, shifts. Second, it poses a methodological problem of measuring the degree of deformation of the democratic institutions. Third, it allows one to look at the United States in a comparative perspective, drawing on the experience of other countries.
   The article analyzes why the image of Weimar America is relevant for the political agenda of the United States, considers various interpretations of the meaning of the current changes, contours and basic parameters of the erosion of democracy and the system of separation of powers, polar assessments of the phenomenon of trumpism, as well as the ideas about the possibility of overcoming the political contradictions faced by one of the oldest democracies in the world. In the conclusion, the author examines the question of the Weimar paradigm of the collapse of democracies and demonstrates the extent to which the above discussed problems are specific to the United States, and to which extent they reflect global trends and can be integrated into the general theory of stability of democratic regimes.

DT Article; Book Chapter
DE "Chinese model" of reforms; "Washington consensus"; "Moscow consensus";
   "Beijing consensus"; "Delhi consensus"; "new Chinese consensus"
AB The article examines some topical issues of international significance of the phenomenon of "Chinese model" of socio-economic reforms (the so-called Beijing consensus) terms of its probable feasibil-its' in the economic reforms in the Russian Federation. The issue of the "model"'s role in the general civilizational development is also touched upon. It is emphasized that features, phenomena and concepts of the old "Washington consensus", the old "Moscow consensus", the former "Beijing consensus" and "Delhi (Mumbai) consensus", etc. compose important scientific and methodological experience which may he useful in relevant decision-making.
   The study is conducted in the style of prognostic and analytical assessment.
   The question of theoretical and practical demand in categories "socialist society" and "communist society", which now clearly need qualitative clarification, is also raised. To accomplish this task, the analysis of the applicability of various theories and practices of "meritocracy" appears to be even more useful. 'the analysis can also play a positive role in the future promotion of a new universal and optimal model of social and environmental development which is to take into account interests of joint progress of Russia and China and other advanced world "centers" as well. It is significant that "early" Marx himself believed that "communism is not the limit of human history...".
   It should be borne in mind that, like the "globalization" phenomenon, the current processes of "post-globalization" including "repatriation", "re-sovereignization", etc. are not the "end of history", as it was interpreted by F. Fukuyama and other Western ideologists. Western political science sees the "end of the history" as the "eternal triumph" of liberal-market democracy of the neo-capitalist type. The specific directions, ways, forms and methods of a new global society formation will be determined by the life itself, but the duty of the scientific community is to contribute to the timely identification and prediction of the features of this process. In view of this, it would be advisable to establish under the auspices of the Institute of Far Eastern Studies of the RAS an ad hoc working group on the study of the optimization of models-paradigms of global socio-economic development.

For this goal a bibliometric study was conducted, covering review of articles in the leading Russian business newspapers and academic publications in journals, cited by Russian Science Citation Index (RSCI); educational programs in the top Russian universities. The results indicate small attention to purely economic patterns of cooperation between the countries while exaggerated focus on political and energy issues. In most cases Russians have limited access to data and trusted publications in Russian language which covers topics of intra-EU trade and economic cooperation as well as EU-Russia trade. Some advice on improvement to educational and governmental bodies is suggested.

DT Article
DE Vandana Shiva; globalization; alter-globalism; bioethics; survival
   forest; "green revolution"; biotechnologies; biopiracy; biodiversity;
   patents; seeds; "Navdanya"
AB The article analyzes the views of Vandana Shiva, an Indian researcher, philosopher and prominent social and political figure, who is critical of the modern processes of globalization. Shiva insists that for countries of the Third World, globalization is unfair and contrasts it with alter-globalism. In its analysis of the situation, it relies on a bioethical tradition associated with the name of Van Potter, and widely uses the views of the classics of Indian social and political thought. For Shiva, bioethics is the science of survival, which expresses the interests of the masses and allows one to resist the intervention of global Western capitalism and its immediate agents - transnational corporations. In her scientific works, she shows what forms this intervention takes during history and very critically evaluates international development programs for India and other developing countries. Shiva focuses on the problems of using moist tropical forests, modernizing agriculture, the use of biotechnology. From her point of view, the development programs that are imposed on India by international organizations do not benefit it. They neglect local cultural traditions of using natural resources - forest, land, water, seeds, which, on the contrary, are an example of the developed ecological thinking of the peoples of the Third World. As before, the capitalist West continues to impose India on its economic, technical and cultural backwardness, while at the same time plundering its natural resources and causing irreparable damage to its biodiversity. Recently, this robbery took sophisticated forms related to the use of patents and the sale of genetically modified seeds. Shiva calls them biopiracy. Participating in the fight against this phenomenon, she created the Navdanya Foundation, which became an organizational, educational and resource center for resisting the biopiracy of transnational corporations.

AB The regional history is one of the dominating research directions now and the address to it in the Siberian context only confirms this tendency. The considerable contribution to studying of Siberia in the last third of XIX - the beginning of XX from the natural-science and ethnographical and archaeological point of view was brought by researchers - N.M. Martyanov and D.A. Klements.
   The purpose to this article is on the basis of attraction of big archival material, mainly epistolary heritage of two of these scientists, to reconstruct history of their relationship and to track as their more than twenty years friendship not only influenced formation of their scientific interests, but also in practice with the organization and carrying out direct researches in various corners of Western and Eastern Siberia.
   The analysis of the available extensive massive, both the archival and published sources convincingly shows that during the Minusinsk exile of D.A. Klements, in which N.M. Martyanov has played the most important role in D.A. Klements's formation as traveler and scientist. In turn D.A. Klements during the expeditions on the Minusinsk district, Tyva and other earlier poorly studied areas of Southern Siberia and also writing of the book "Antiquities of the Minusinsk museum. Monuments of metal eras" in no small measure promoted formation of the Minusinsk museum and finding of popularity by it in the European scientific community.
   Close friendly and scientific contacts between N.M. Martyanov and D.A. Klements were not interrupted also after departure of the last to Minusinsk. The analysis of their long-term correspondence shows that in it they gave a lot of place to scientific perspective. D.A. Klements in the expeditions constantly cared not only for replenishment of collections of the Minusinsk museum, but also did no't forget about the scientific interests of N.M. Martyanov in the sphere of botany. And N.M. Martyanov in turn advised D.A. Klements concerning museum business and helped with collecting geological material within its scientific subject. Besides, during the stay of D.A. Klements as at first on a post of the governor Western-Siberian department of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society and as the main collector of the Museum of archeology and ethnography and at last on a post of the manager of Ethnographic department of the Russian Museum, N.M. Martyanov according to the lights and opportunities helped him assembled museum collections.
   Thus, on the basis of the studied material the author came to a conclusion that close companionship of these extraordinary persons mutually enriched them intellectually and in practice helped implementation of their numerous scientific projects. And it has in turn allowed them to play a considerable role not only in geographical, geological, botanical, archaeological and ethnographic studying of Minusinsk hollow and some other Areas of Siberia, but also in formation of museum matter in Russia.

TI HISTORIOGRAPHY OF THE SOVIET TELECOMMUNICATIONS (1945-1980S)
SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE telecommunication; telegraph; telephone; radio communication
AB The author of the article sets a goal - to analyze the literature devoted to the problems of history and the development of Soviet telecommunication (telegraph, telephone and radio communication) from the post-war period to perestroika. The specificity of works on the history of telecommunications is due to the fact that telecommunication as one of the areas of science and technology combines the most diverse areas of knowledge. The post-war period of historiography (1945 - 1980s) was undoubtedly the most fruitful for studying the history of telecommunications and therefore deserves special attention. During this time, considerable experience was gained in covering a wide range of issues of the history and development of communications. The patriotic interest in the history of Russian science and technology as a whole has grown noticeably. It is noted that the common for the authors of the pre-war period of historiography was a pronounced negative attitude to the pre-revolutionary time in the history of communication. At the same time, the attention paid to the problem of low telecommunications and the approach of postal, telegraph and telephone communication to the Russian village is positive.
   The scope of work covering the theory and practice of telecommunications, broadcasting, television, has expanded throughout the entire period. At the same time, the works of the "Svyaz" publishing house occupied a central place in the literary file. A significant part of information on the history of the country's telecommunications and its individual regions was published in specialized periodicals. It should be noted that most of the research concerned the pre-revolutionary period in the history of telecommunications in the scale of the whole country, and the authors' interests were grouped primarily around the main enterprises, laboratories, and communications institutes - in Moscow, Leningrad, and Nizhny Novgorod. Popular was also the topic of the role of party organizations in the development of communication. In general, this period was the time of a surge of interest of researchers to the problems of telecommunications, apparently related to the general rise of historical science. However, despite the growing interest in telecommunication problems throughout the entire period, the main attention was paid to the socio-political, social, and not the historical-technical aspect of the problem.

AB The government constantly fretted over the "cost of empire", which it understood as the expense of possessing any borderlands as part of the state. The Ministry of Finance calculated the cost as the difference between state outlays for the maintenance of its administration and armed forces, the construction of borders and towns, and the installation of railways, as well as other expenses from the treasury, on the one hand, and budget revenue from all taxes and income the treasury received, on the other.The problem of the cost of empire and the empire's unity, however, is not confined to economic gains and losses. From the empire's point of view, the issues that played a huge role were the empire's security, its military, economic, and geopolitical power, messianism, cultural and religious predominance, the resolution of internal political problems, the legitimization of the emperor's rule, the prestige of the supreme authority and the state, and other matters. For their part, the borderlands assessed the cost of empire and also took non-material factors into account: the degree of security, the extent of the center's civilizing mission, the danger of assimilation and of the loss of ethnic identity, the desire for ethno-cultural autonomy, and others. Appraising the intangible factors is much more difficult and, above all, more problematic, because the perspectives of the center and the peripheral regions differ and it is often impossible to find consensus.The relationship between the center and the borderlands of the Russian empire was so varied, multifaceted, and dynamic that to express it through a single formula or scenario is impossible. The field of ethnopolitics offers three several such schemes to describe the nature of relations between the center and the periphery: the concept of hegemony, of internal colonization, and of diffusionian. Analysis of the center's relations with the borderlands in the imperial period shows that at various times and in various regions all three scenarios have been realized, but most often the government followed the concepts of hegemony and diffusion. Occasionally, one encounters elements of colonialism in the early stages of the acquisition of the borderlands. Close administrative, legal, and economic integration on the basis of mutual advantages continuously lies at the center of the government's attention. But the main purpose of the supreme authority and its government consisted of preserving the integrity of the empire. For this reason, they were prepared to make any sacrifices on the part of the Russians. In extreme cases, however, they required that other peoples of the empire also sacrifice their own interests for a time.

TI Barry Buzan and the English School of International Relations

DT Article
DE English School of International Relations; international community;
   world community; Barry Buzan
AB This article is devoted to Barry Buzan and his role in the modern development of the English School of International Relations (the School). The aim of the article is to demonstrate the main aspects and the problems of the School's theory at the turn of the 21st century. The sources for the study were the texts of published works by leading members of the School and by Buzan. The English School of International Relations was formed in the 1950s--1960s. Historians Herbert Butterfield, Martin Wight, Adam Watson, Michael Howard, philosophers Donald McKinnon and Hedley Bull took an active part in the creation of this school. The concept "international society" becomes a symbol and a distinctive mark of this community thanks to Hedley Bull's books of the 1970s--1980s. However, by the end of the 20th century, the development of the School faced with many objective and subjective difficulties. Barry Buzan is a famous and authoritative specialists in international relations in the world science. His research is generally recognized in the United States, China, and many European countries. His books demonstrate his abilities to work in different theoretical directions. At the same time, he is an important figure for understanding the main change in the School during the past 20 years. The results of his involvement in the English School theory are as following. (1) He supposes that the concept "world society" is an important part of the English School theory. Like two other principal elements of the general conception -- "international society" and "system states" - the concept "world society" was key for Wight, Bull and other first members of the community; however, the content of the concept was uncertain. Buzan raises a complex of specific questions which define the content of the concept in the School's research program. (2) Buzan continues to study the history of international relations as an autonomous part of the School's agenda. He adapted the idea of an international system to the epoch before the Peace of Westphalia (1648). He continues the tradition of the School's writers (Wight, Watson), who thought that history was important part of the study of international relations. This position of the English School differs from the American discipline, in which international relations are traditionally considered as a branch of political science. (3) Buzan tries to include economic issues into the agenda of the English School theory. Ignoring economic problems in international relations is a traditional drawback of the international society concept. This part of his work is not complete, but he made first important steps in it. (4) Buzan makes a new organizational format for the School after the British Committee on the Theory of International Politics finished its work. The Committee worked for 25 years (1959--1985) and became the basis for the development of the two first generations of the English School of International Relations. Buzan made the concept of international society more open to discussions in modern science, more popular among specialists in international relations abroad. At same time, he preserved the bases of the English School theory. Thanks to his activity during the past 20 years, the English School of International Relations is considered as an autonomous part of the world theory of international relations today.

AB The article is written with the death of German philosopher Robert Spaemann in mind and is a kind of philosophical obituary summing up some of the results of the philosopher's life relating to his position as a citizen. In Germany, his philosophy was attributed to the so-called Ritter School, although his views were strongly influenced by H.-G. Gadamer, whom he followed while working at the University of Heidelberg. Many of his works were created at the intersection of ethics and political philosophy. Here, one of his favorite themes was human dignity, which was primarily related to the fact that man belongs to the human race and this determines the basic values of existence. Hence, his attitude towards the value of life itself and his negative attitude towards suicide as a conscious withdrawal from life or euthanasia are found. In recent years, before his death, he had been engaged in philosophical analysis and the criticism of the new system of European values which was detached from the peculiarities of national, primarily religious, values. In this regard, he criticized political power for not relying on moral principles.

At the base of the study is the work in the style of "presenteeism" with the texts of documents adopted at the federal government level in 2016-2018, expert assessments of scientists, scientific and technical workers of academic institutions and universities, officials of state bodies and universities that have different views on the original positions and prospects for the scientific, technological and educational development.
   The main result of the research is the presentation of the fact that the Russian example of efforts to develop the scientific and technological sphere has, from our point of view, one peculiarity of principle in the context of globalization, to which we should take a closer look. Today Russia is becoming a country where at a new socio-economic and political stage an active search for state support for various forms of scientific, technological and educational development is taking place in conjunction with private and individual models of influence on this area. It conceals the content of the conflict and the tension between the state bureaucracy and the academic community.

DT Article
DE Orthodox radicalism; Republic of Moldova; Law on Ensuring Equality
AB Based on the case of the Republic of Moldova, the author shows that when the Orthodox Church faces external challenges, its regular and conventional methods of building church-state relations do not promote ecclesiastical interests anymore. Paraecclesiastical political actors represented by radical movements of clergy and laity uncontrolled by the bishops move to the foreground. Such actors renounce conventional methods of political participation and even use low-intensity violence to confront the state. The author concludes that Orthodox radicals are antagonists not so much to the state, but to the Church leadership, eventually splitting from the Church altogether. This conclusion is backed by analysing antagonism between the Orthodox Church of Moldova and the state policy of securing - in accordance with the EU requirements - equal employment rights for the LGBT people. Symbolically, pride parades became the focus of the church-state confrontation. As an alternative to them, the Church has organized its own rallies in support of family and traditional values. The article demonstrates that, by using informal negotiations, the Metropolitanate of Moldova failed to convince the state authorities that the Law on Ensuring Equality should be called back; as a result, it was forced to openly criticize state policy. At the same time, unlike the radicals, the Church is not ready to confront the state. The publication's methodology includes analysing legal documents, mass media materials, and other sources, and on the author's fieldwork in the Republic of Moldova in 2011, 2013, 2019.

AB The issue of immigration management is one of the most complex and relevant both in academic science and practical politics. It polarizes public opinion and provokes fierce debate. One of the most important objective of the domestic policy of countries with a large number of immigrants is effective socio-economic integration of foreign cultural communities and consolidation of the civil society. The article deals with the general issues of integration of Muslim immigrants in the UK and France in the economy; provides data on their number, employment, income and social status compared with the ethnic majority. The information framework of the research includes official statistics, sociological surveys, analytics of government institutions and commissions, reports of well-known research centers and Muslim organizations. Due to the peculiarities of statistics it is impossible to directly compare the situation of British and French Muslims. Moreover, in the UK and France, migrant integration is carried out according to different historical models. The article demonstrates the specific features of each country in migrant resettlement, the position of Muslims in the labor market among various immigrant minorities, the issues of the national policy in fighting against discrimination and Islamophobia. The purpose of the article is to focus on objective quantitative and qualitative indicators of economic activity of Muslim immigrants in the two countries in question to overcome the existing stereotypes and political speculation. Analysis of the economic status of Muslims in the UK and France reveals a significant spread depending on the country of origin, country of birth, belonging to the first or the second generation of immigrants. The article concludes that the UK opens up more opportunities for the economic integration of Muslims than France.

LA Russian
DT Book Review
DE post-Horde studies; Crimean Khanate; tribute; successor states of the
   Golden Horde; Grand Duchy of Moscow; Grand Duchy of Lithuania
AB The development of the post-Horde's research in recent years requires the summarizing of intermediate results and the formulation of new research problems. In his latest monograph "From Vassals to Overlords. The Russian State and the Heirs of the Golden Horde", Roman Pochekaev offered his vision of the solutions to several key problems. The book contains essays on the history of relations between the Moscow State and various Turkic and Mongol states, and then those between the Russian Empire and the Kazakh Khanate. This review is limited to the first part of the monograph and focuses on the relations of the Muscovite State with the Turko-Mongol states in the 15th-17th centuries. This section is divided into three chapters, "The Redistribution of the Inheritance of the Golden Horde", "The Establishment of Inter-state Relations in the New Conditions", and "Political and Legal Realities on the Post-Horde's Space through the Eyes of Foreign Contemporaries". Each chapter consists of several essays on a single problem. However, not all assumptions were equally worked out. The present review focuses on the criticism of the "weak" (in the opinion of the reviewer) areas of the research. To list these "weaknesses" - first, the uneven degree of the study of the source material. Secondly, not all the proposed hypotheses have a solid documentary base. However, the book also contains successful solutions. The author's historical and legal essays are of great interest, although it is regrettable that they are based on limited material. It is possible that an analysis of the legal practices of the post-Horde's states would be more fruitful, especially the development of a methodology for studying legal conflicts in Kasimov and more widely among the Moscow service Tatars: which rules of law were used? Was it the Russian law, the Sharia, or customary law? It is a pity that these questions have found too little space within the book. Despite the serious intention to summarize the accumulated information, the task of creating a holistic generalizing work on the history of the post-Horde's political space was not fulfilled, although a step forward toward that goal has been made.

AB There is an active development and use of the principles and research tools of the institutional approach in modem economic science. It allows establishing the relationships that exist between the economic, political and social elements of the system, expanding the boundaries of economic life. The institutional environment determines the goals, functions and dynamics of interaction in property relations. Thus, it appears the effectiveness of functioning of its various forms, which will depend on the institutional structure of management as a system of norms and rules that determine the configuration of property rights, together with coercive instruments. The article considers the approach from the theory of constructivism, which describes the structural features of property relations, taking as a basis the system of network coordination of relations. Formation of a network structure and a new, non-hierarchical way of coordinating ties reflects new economic realities associated with the strong interdependence of property subjects. Formation of a knowledge economy, development of globalization, integration of property subjects have led to the accelerated development of innovations, to a new quality of property relations. Innovations are supported by a huge agglomeration of social, innovative, intellectual and financial capital, which forms the emergence of "innovations in innovations" and determines the relevance of studying the system of network coordination of relations.

AB Introduction. The purpose of this article is to return the concept of ultra-long military cycles (hereinafter referred to as ULMS) by Russian political scientist, philosopher and philologist Vadim L. Tsymbursky (1957-2009) to the methodological toolkit of modern political science and use it to identify potential key threats to the modern international security system. Methods and materials. The article makes a hypothesis about the early termination of the last of the ULMS selected by V. L. Tsymbursky, which began with the invention of a nuclear weapon in 1945 and was characterized by the predominance of possibilities of destruction over mobilization - the so-called "depressed" ULMS. This type of ULMS is characterized by the absence of large-scale long-lasting wars, the stability of the world political system. Analysis. The author of the article argues that under the influence of scientific and technical discoveries in the field of armaments (high-precision weapons combined with low-yield nuclear warheads, "swarm weapons", cybernetic weapons, biological weapons, the global missile defense system) and socio-political technologies (manipulating flows of refugees, "hybrid war", global weakening of national identities and social stratification of nations with the formation of "international elites"), the great powers are able to overcome the "nuclear impasse" and the world political system may enter the phase of increased risk of developing a full-scale world war. Results. In the coming decades, the world may enter the stage of an "expansive" ULMS, characterized by the return to the rate on mobilization resources as the main factor in the military-political confrontation. According to the author, one of the most effective ways to peacekeeping is the development of public diplomacy, multilateral international contacts at the level of non-state actors.

AB The consideration is given to the role of Natalia Pushkareva in creating and developing gender history and anthropology trends in Russian humanities. In the 1980s, Pushkareva marked the beginning of the study of women's history in Russia. The stages of her professional development and the most important academic achievements in the field of gender studies are shown in the article. The authors reveal the features of research techniques of the scholar. She formed an academic school in gender history by leading the sector of ethno-gender studies in the Institute for Ethnography and Anthropology of Russian Academy of Sciences. She actively introduced new methodological approaches, convincing that gender studies are an integrative direction of modern social and humanitarian knowledge, that borrows approaches and research techniques from sociology, political science, psychology, linguistics, literary criticism, etc. Attention is paid to the activities of the Russian Association of Female History Researchers (RAFHR) founded and headed by Pushkareva. The non-profit organization unites lecturers and researchers in women's history. The article assesses Pushkareva's academic contribution to enhancing the heuristic significance of historical research potential for studying systems of gender relations. Attention is also paid to the international resonance of Pushkareva's activities, whose works were published and republished not only in Russia, but in other countries as well, and were marked by numerous foreign reviews and professional awards, which means the international recognition of her achievements.

DE Kim Jong Il; Kim Ok Kyun; Kapsin Coup; historical science; revolution
AB In January 1999, a previously unknown work by Kim Jong Il titled On Making an Accurate Appraisal to the Kapsin Coup was published. It allegedly presents the contents of Kim's talk with his fellow students in May 1963. The document puts that the coup d'etat Kim Ok Kyun and his followers undertook in 1884 (Kapsin year, by the Chinese traditional calendar) had been a "bourgeois reform". Such views were popular amongst North Korean academic and political circles of the 1950s to 1960s and again in the mid-1980s. The work was reprinted thrice during Kim Jong Il's years in office. Some North Korean accounts first appeared in the 2000s tell that the Kapsin events were a "bourgeois revolution", with using both "reform" and "revolution" and citing Kim's work. Books and articles for the broad audience inside and outside the DPRK portray this coup as a reform, also borrowing heavily from On Making an Accurate Appraisal to the Kapsin Coup. Well-known North Korean experts in modern Korean political history such as Prof. Li Chong Hyon insist on that reforms, not revolution, comprise the essence of Kim Ok Kyun's followers. North Korean leaders' revolutionary outlook leaves no room to evaluate the Kapsin Coup as a "revolution". After the mid-1980s, the DPRK historical science had had no fresh discussions on the matter.

AB This article is devoted to the problem of risks in the activities of political parties. The importance of risk management is growing in conditions of social tension, which are a characteristic of Russia. The study identified the main risk factors for the ruling United Russia party in the Transbaikal Territory. These include: 1) social tension and poor quality of life; 2) internal migration and urbanization; 3) natural disasters; 4) political instability; 5) protest activity of the population; 6) competition from other political parties. A model is proposed as a conceptual basis for managing political risks in the activities of political parties. Its main components are: subjects and objects, goals, objectives and principles, resources, functions and mechanisms, specific technologies and management tools. Each of the components of the model is concretized in the context of managing political risks in the activities of the regional branch of the United Russia party, taking into account the specifics of the Transbaikal Territory. At the end of the article, it is concluded that this model can be considered as universal (for other regions and parties).

DT Article

AB Hybrid society is a "big problem" for civilization and one of the possible defining features of the world order of the 21st century. Policy, economy, culture, war and peace, and other group interactions merge into a sophisticated continuum. Strategic advantage goes to systems able to operate efficiently in complex situations. Socio-cultural gravity (geo-culture) dominates in the world with elastic, liquid architecture. Proactive personality, private enterprises, and partnerships replace rigid, bureaucratic institutions, as well as the uprising of the elite replaces riots of the masses. The heterogeneity of Oecumene is connected not only with different levels of social and technological development. Agricultural, industrial, postindustrial societies differently adapt to critical circumstances. Military conflicts in recent times have taken placed mostly in the Afroasian zone of instability: Syrian maze, so-called "Islamic State", Yemen, turbulent Libya, clashes in a number of states in Black Africa etc. This synthesis of military and civilian practices risks establishing itself as a new socio-political reality and cultural norm. A sophisticated hybrid world undermines the political consensus and the moral imperative of Modernity. Nuclear weapons may become an umbrella for corrupted actions. A glitch in the credibility of the security contracts can lead to the bankruptcy of the organization of the international community.

AB The article analyzes two management paradigms, distinguished by the place that is assigned to it in the social system. Management can be seen as a superstructure, secondary process and as a basic process, which is the cause of social change. It is shown that in the first case, management is taken into account only as an external factor in relation to everyday economic, political, cultural interactions, and therefore its potential for social changes is often underestimated. This is also characteristic of Russian science. In the second case, management is considered as a basic process that assimilates cultural and value models of social development, and therefore it should be studied in the broad context of symbolic-semantic forms. They considered the features of normative and value rationality application to both paradigms. (C) 2019 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.

The methodology of the study comprises the assessment of the political communication of the deputies in social networks based on three factors: coverage, activeness and involvement. In view of the worldwide practice, theoretical premises and the up to date Russian legislation we qualify the online professional behavior of the local authorities representatives as violation of the regulation and the effective public policy. Finally, recommendations how to deal with the low level of the online activity of the politicians in view of the effective public policy making are offered.

Classical myth that have appeared in the piece of fiction in a new, original version, is viewed as an allegory of the events, contemporary with Dracontius, a conflict between the Romans and the Vandals. A view from such perspective gives an opportunity to re-estimate cardinally traditional, widespread in academic research belief about the character system and configuration in this work.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE correspondence; V.A. Zhukovsky; F. von Muller; I.V. Goethe; Romanticism;
   Weimar classicism
AB The article dwells on the correspondence between the Russian poet and the Tsar's mentor and the Weimar Chancellor, poet and prominent cultural figure F. von Muller. Covering twenty years and including more than 60 letters, the correspondence has never been in the academic focus before. The author identifies the main plots in the life-creating epistolary dialogue of the two romanticists, which provide important facts of Zhukovsky's civilizing activity and his connections with the German world. The epistolary dialogue of the two poets and prominent political leaders of Russia and Germany of the first half of the 19th century has already been discussed by scholars, yet it has never been exposed to public as an integral whole. Meanwhile, the epistolary appears to be of paramount importance for understanding the literary and court life of Russia and Europe during the time of their thriving cultures, suffice it to recall the leading role of Chancellor von Miller in the institutional history of Weimar classicism as well as the preservation and enhancement of its heritage and the role of V.A. Zhukovsky as a poet, translator, thinker, patron of the arts and Alexander II's mentor. Among the main topics of the epistolary dialogue were the myth of Goethe, romantic travelogue, religious-romantic discourse about lowliness during life, and the philosophy of memory. The Goethe's figure has always been present in the friendship of the Chancellor and the Russian poet as a constant focus of attention in their letters and a companion of their personal meetings after Zhukovsky's move to Germany. That is why Goethe's name can hardly be found in the letters of the 1840s. For twenty years of their communication, Zhukovsky and Muller have bid farewell to more than a dozen common acquaintances, monarchs, relatives, writers, and friends. Most of the letters contained information about the decease of a dear person or a memorable response on a similar occasion. On the one hand, this constitutive plot cannot be considered only from an artistic and aesthetic perspective, since it is connected with actual extra-epistolary circumstances, yet, on the other hand, its deplorable position is in harmony with the correspondents' romanticism nature: Miller and Zhukovsky intentionally verbalize and recognize the importance of perpetuating the image of a person after his departure, understanding it as a guarantee of immortality in his life-affinity. First, this vector is realized in the corresponding poetic genre of dedication or the literary and journalistic obituary in prose. While Miller dubbed Zhukovsky as "a northern singer", Zhukovsky considers the Chancellor a master of the memorial genre. Their joint work on the obituary of A.I. Turgenev reflects their philosophy of romantic memory. The correspondence between Miller and Zhukovsky epitomizes "progressive universal poetry" ("progressive Universalpoesie") and tireless romantic search for the ideal synthetic form suitable for art to merge with natural life, poetry with philosophy and rhetoric. The Romantic poetry of the epistolary communication between V.A. Zhukovsky and F. von Miller "can be viewed as a mirror of the whole world, a reflection of the era" (F. Schlegel). The commented edition of the correspondence corpus in French and German with a Russian translation will become a new word in modern humanitarian knowledge.

AB During the Cold War, the superpowers used their ideologies as symbolic capital in the struggle for new spheres of influence. The United States emphasized slogans of freedom and democratic values, and the USSR propagated ideas of socialism. One of the key "messages" exploited by Soviet cultural diplomacy in the post-war world was the image of the October Revolution as a benchmark for the struggle for a just socialist system. The ideas of Great October were most intensively vocalized and reinterpreted during round-number anniversaries. In 1947, officially celebrated for the first time not only in the Soviet Union, the thirtieth anniversary of the October Revolution had witnessed the initial efforts of the USSR to sovietize Central and Eastern European countries' cultures and ideologies. By exploring this case, the article surveys the mechanisms and ways the Soviet festive activities and rituals were implanted and adjusted to foreign surroundings. Jubilee celebrations are taken here as part of commemorative practices aimed at developing a "socialist" identity in Central and Eastern Europe and their further integration into the Soviet cultural and political space of influence. Reconstructing the general mode of the holiday and the specifics of its functioning in different countries, the article concludes that, in many respects, the first "common" commemoration of the October Revolution abroad represented a "transitional" stage where Soviet ideological messages were relatively fuzzy and imposed rituals had to be variably adjusted to Eastern European social environments.

AB This article provides insight into the state of the judicial system in post-Soviet Russia within social context. It involves results of a survey of the Russian citizens' attitude towards the judicial system and judiciary. Majority disapproval is determined by the fact that people do not respect or trust courts of law assuming that they are dependent and influenced by other political and economic actors. They believe that the judges are not willing to protect citizens' rights, are corrupt, unfair and inhumane, which determines the accusatory bias of the Russian judicial system. At the same time, Russian judiciary consists mainly of representatives of administrative and bureaucratic professional subculture focused on superior authorities and powers, most court chairpersons have Soviet professional training and experience. The judicial system of post-Soviet Russia has inherited problems of Soviet justice and is incapable of acting in the social system as an impartial arbitrator and conscience of the state.

DT Article
DE bilingualism; diglossia; chancery; Latin; French; N. P. Likhachev
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the use of Latin and vernacular languages in the French royal chancery during the Late Middle Ages. The language played an important role in constructing and strengthening the State. The idea of the unification of language went hand in hand with the idea of political unification. In France, the most important stage in the transition from Latin to the vernacular language was the 14th century. The first examples of the use of the vernacular language in the work of the chancery emerged on the periphery. The transition from Latin to French was not instantaneous, but took place in several phases. It should be noted that the ratio of languages was uneven in various areas of office work, and also depended on the region to which the charter was related. In this regard, many researchers propose to speak not about bilingualism, but about diglossia. Conceding with the validity of this remark, it is possible to complete this picture with several documents. In the collection of Nikolai Petrovich Likhachev (1862-1936) there is the charter of King John II (1352), the protocol and eschatocol of which are written in Latin, and the main part - in French. An analysis of this document shows how closely Latin and French coexisted in the documents of the royal chancery of France in the 14th century. It dissolves the boundaries between the niches occupied by one or the other language. Therefore, it seems not always correct to talk about diglossia.

AB The article is devoted to the comparative analysis of terrorist tactics, in particular to the search for macro-causes of the appeal to the political murders of prominent state and public figures. Examined are the political and social-economic conditions related to political murders committed by terrorists, and conditions associated with the attacks of suicide bombers. In the course of the study. a series of negative binomial regression models were constructed for four periods from 1995 to 2011. As a result, some root causes clearly linked to the use of terrorist tactics of political assassinations were identified. The findings indicate that terrorist tactics stem from various underlying problems in the country.

DT Article
DE Afghanistan; Afghan conflict; regional powers; Pakistan; India; Iran;
   China; the Taliban; terrorism
AB The article represents a range of perspectives of the regional states' politics in the Afghan conflict. Regional powers seek to secure their interests. Many of the security challenges of the region persist. Pakistan tolerates and secretly supports terrorist groups. It has nuclear weapons, weak state institutions, and contentious relations with India. Pro-pakistani groups in Afghanistan poses a direct threat to India, because militancy in Afghanistan, as New Delhi supposes, could spill over into India. The relations of Iran with the Taliban are highly complicated. It is a combination of restrained support and containment. The main goal of Iranians - to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a US political-military bastion. Economic interests of China are expanding, that is why Beijing is deepening its level of engagement in the region. However, a core Chinese security aim is to overcome Uygur separatism. As it is shown in the article, multiple factors are behind regional states' politics towards Afghanistan. All of them should be taken into consideration because Afghan conflict settlement could be reached if supported by a regional diplomatic accord brokered by the United States and Russia.

DT Article
DE administrative reform; involution; administrative-territorial division;
   spatial identity; autonomous districts
AB The article attempts to identify the attitude to the reform of the administrative-territorial division that took place in Russia in the mid-2000s in the affected regions and to trace the reasons for why people perceive the reform in one way or the other. The empirical data for the study come from a series of in-depth interviews with the representatives of the regional government, local government and civil society obtained in the administrative centers of the territories that lost their autonomy as well as the regions that they were united with.
   The study revealed that the reform had not only official goals, such as reducing economic inequality and increasing the efficiency of public administration, but also unofficial goals. The federal center pursued strengthening of centripetal forces within the Russian federalism, while regional elites desired an increase in the regionals budgets and improvement of the status of their regions. As the reform progressed, official goals increasingly gave way to unofficial ones, which led to the suspension of the reform. The regions that obtained new territories advantageously increased their weight in the structure of the Russian federalism and gained complete control over the financial flows and the executive power in the districts, but the price to pay was a compensatory redistribution of budget funds. The territories that were joined to the regions benefited from the implementation of a number of infrastructure projects, the increase in the funds allocated to support the national culture, and the access to krai/oblast programs, but they lost out in terms of their status and having a direct link to Moscow.
   The study showed that psychological factor plays the key role in the perception of the reform. Regardless of the real consequences of the unification for a particular territory, those who have obtained a higher status support the reform, while those who lost their status opposed it. The main reasons for the negative assessment of the reform are the following: (1) the lack of a common institutional model for integration; (2) high expectations; (3) the absence of a clearly defined goal of unification; (4) the status and political-cultural "aberration" that made people blame the reform for their own problems, even those that had nothing to do with the reform.

AB The set of textbooks, written by the lecturers of Department of Oriental Studies, MGIMO-University, is a very useful publication both in terms of research and education. It covers the wide field of key problems of contemporary Islam and fills out some gaps in Russian studies of Islam.
   The first book of the series is focused on processes of globalization and democratization in Islamic world.The authors examine the role of Muslim states in multi-vector development of regional and global politics, analyze the impact of Islamic structures and concepts on present system of international relations. In the second book the authors emphasize the role of Islamic factor in domestic political life of specific countries and regions of the Muslim world. The authors focus on fundamental issues of constitutional law, functioning of supreme state bodies, building of parties and political systems. In the third book of the series the authors review the ideas of contemporary Muslim philosophers, public figures, political writers both of conservative-fundamentalist and liberal-modernist orientation, basing on numerous facts. The authors managed to present the diversity of solutions, proposed by Muslim politicians and thinkers aimed at facing a number of challenges such as modernization and globalization, migration crises, poor ecological conditions, rise of social inequality, erosion and substitution of traditional values of Islam, etc. The textbooks in review may be of special interest not only for teachers and students at universities and high schools, but also for specialists in Oriental studies, political studies, as well as for broad audience of readers.

   Archeology of the Peaceful Atom; Situated Speech; Scale; Ecology of
   Discourse; Nuclear Veterans
ID BRITISH NUCLEAR CULTURE; DISCOURSE; SCIENCE; WORLD
AB This article is devoted to the discursive construction of radiation. Here nuclear archeology coexists with nuclear ethnography, and empirical research on nuclear industry veterans' speech is supplemented by epistemological work to expand the discursive analytics. I consider scientists and engineers, the pioneers of Soviet atomic technoscience, as carriers of pre-Chernobyl discourses about the "peaceful atom." The article focuses on how these people, for whom radiation had not been a subject of public speech for decades, today include it in retrospective narratives about their life and work addressed to researchers, journalists, residents of the atomic city, and readers of nuclear memoirs. In search of procedures for inclusion and conditions of possibility for articulation of radiation, I turn to the analysis of discursive figures, formations, and individual speech situations-that is, I combine in a single study different scales of discursive analytics. In the article, three discursive formations of the "peaceful atom"-grouped around nuclear optimism, radiation damage, and safety-are briefly characterized in an archaeological mode. I suggest that the conditions of possibility for absence of radiation in the nuclear industry veterans' speech are determined by radiation's position in relation to larger atomic discourses. At the same time, the inclusion of radiation in discourse always occurs in a local situation of interaction with its own pragmatic resources for meaning production. The article describes how the stories, circumstances, positions, and affects that belong to competing discursive formations are incorporated into the discourse of nuclear veterans through particular discursive acts and events-comments, euphemisms, remarks, indirect speech, hints, erosion of syntax, stories about the past, and anecdotes. Sometimes these inclusions are incompatible with the views, values, and beliefs of veterans themselves; sometimes they threaten the existence of their life-worlds. One of the main conditions for their incorporation into discourse is the small dosage. I describe the procedures for minimizing and weakening alien elements that support an extended order of discursive production and the interaction of competing discourses as "limiting inclusion" or "discursive dosing." The article suggests complementing the political analytics of discourse, focused on exclusion procedures, with discourse ecology that emphasizes the coexistence of different ( including conflicting) discursive worlds, their hybridization, contact, and inclusion techniques.

AB Video games have long been part of our daily life. They are one of the popular hobbies bringing together millions of people around the world, a booming industry with a total of billion-dollars income, a subject of scientific studies by specialists from different fields of knowledge: philosophy, computer science, psychology, sociology, art history. The participants of other discourses political, pedagogical, journalistic, etc. take the similar interest for them as well. Mass and traditional media (cinema, literature) are also involved in video games discussion, and thus contribute to the constructing and broadcasting of related meanings and representations. Even animated series for pre-school and primary school-age children have not been immune to the topic. Considering the predominantly negative nature of the discussions circulating in the Russian public space, we decided to find out how exactly video games are represented in domestic cartoons. Do these representations correspond to reality, or are they a projection of social fears, typical of video game discourses focused on adults?

DE Eurasian Economic Union; integration; support base; unity; solidarity;

AB This article focuses on the conceptualization of the support base of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) as an indicator of solidarity, unity of the member-state population around the integration concept and condition for the EEU successful development, and also stresses the importance of social-humanitarian aspects in the construction of the EEU. Based on the results of sociological studies (1), the article identifies the dynamics of the social support of integration processes by the member-state population in 2014-2018, and notes its decrease in the majority of member-states, differentiation in integration moods by age, and factors responsible for the decrease of the EEU's support base. The author considers main directions, practices and instruments to enhance the social support for integration, and emphasizes that the concept of solidarity is interconnected with the ideas of social stability and justice. The author refers to the works of contemporary Russian and foreign scholars who developed the methodological grounds for promoting solidarity, and identifies ways to extend the EEU's support base. The article shows that the resource of social solidarity, unity and structural-functional integration of the EEU is in the everyday efforts to strengthen it together with the economic efficiency, and this resource can be ensured by the political and civil discourse of the member states in the field of social-humanitarian cooperation. The development of the support base for integration processes includes such practices and resources that ensure interiorization of symbols, norms, values, and solidarity of the peoples and elites of the Eurasian Economic Union.

AB This article analyses a panoramic spectrum of methodological approaches to the study of political processes and political reality, reacting to the publication of the Handbook "Modern Political Science: Methodology" that incorporates chapters prepared by the thirty three leading Russian political scientists. The authors observe a gradual, but more and more decisive, retreat from the formerly dominating principles 190 of the Marxist methodological paradigm in modem Russian political science. Directions, and the scale of application and implementation within the political science in modem Russia of key methodological paradigms of world political science, include: positivism, behaviorism, structuralism., system analysis, constructivism, etc. A conclusion is made regarding the "mosaic" or composite character of methodological grounds of most of Russian political science schools and books, and the almost complete absence of "pure" methodological lines. The article leads the reader towards the conclusion that political science in Russia is reaching not quite methodological maturity and unity, but at least wide methodological pluralism, enabling researchers to apply in their studies all main worldly spread methodological achievements and paradigms.

AB The March First uprising became a significant event not only in the history of Korea, but also in the history of the Christian church. It became the first national movement with the participation of Christians, as well as representatives of all classes and strata of the Korean society. The Protestant church represented by simple parishioners and Korean preachers sustained with dignity this critical moment of its history, having managed, in spite of all obstacles and cruel repression, to organize the initially spontaneous movement for independence and ensured its legitimate status. The main feature of the March First Uprising was its peaceful, non-violent nature and the religious aspect of the movement, which was caused both by the lack of traditions of European political culture in the country and by unity in the ranks of the Korean national liberation movement.
   Despite its formal defeat, and countless human sacrifices, March 1919 for a long time became a symbol of the spiritual victory of the Korean people. By publicizing the facts of the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations through foreign missionaries in front of the whole world, the "civilizing" image of Japan in Korea was shaken for the first time. The authorities were forced to sit down at the negotiating table, go to a forced dialogue with the Koreans, and subsequently alleviate the conditions of colonial rule.

DE V.N. Lamsdorf; G.A. Planson; A.I. Pavlov; Korean emperor; neutrality;
   Portsmouth Treaty; protectorate treaty; sovereignty; Russia; Korea;
   Japan
AB This article is devoted to the study of the position of the Russian Foreign Ministry led by V.N. Lamsdorf on Korea's independence after signing the Treaty of Protectorate. The work is based on a wide range of sources, mainly archival diplomatic documents, most of which are introduced into the scientific circulation for the first time.
   The author shows that, up to the change in the policy of the Russian government, which occurred after the appointment of A.P. Izvolsky in May 1906, Russia, compelled to recognize Japan's predominant political, military, and economic interests in Korea, invariably adhered to the principle of independence and territorial integrity of Korea, remained committed to the non-recognition of the agreements imposed by Japan on Korea by force, which violated the supreme rights of the Korean emperor, and tried to maintain at least limited sovereignty of Korea by diplomatic means.
   For the first time, the article reveals in detail the efforts of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to nullify the terms of the protectorate agreement and restore the status of the independent Korean state, to strengthen Russia's presence in Korea as the number of Japanese troops in the north of the Peninsula, bordering the Russian Maritime province, was increasing.
   It describes in detail the attempts of Russian diplomacy to resist the claims of the Japanese government to establish complete control over the domestic and foreign policies of Korea, the implementation of the Katsura-Taft agreement regarding the termination of Korean diplomatic relations with all other states.
   In particular, the author of the article draws attention to the Foreign Ministry's message to foreign powers about the protest of the Korean emperor against the Treaty of Protectorate imposed on Korea, in order to encourage them to intervene and protest against the actions of Japan. The article analyzes the attempts of Russian diplomats to raise the fundamental question of the compatibility of the Japanese claims to establish complete control over Korea's domestic and foreign policy with the treaty rights of the Powers, to preserve the form of foreign representation in Korea and to resume the activities of the Russian mission in Seoul, citing Russian-Korean treaties.
   The article clarifies and supplements the official position of Russia on the abolition of the Russo-Korean treaties at the insistence of the Japanese government; on the demotion of the diplomatic mission in Seoul; on what kind of authority should issue the exequatur to foreign consuls in Seoul; and on the abolition of consular jurisdiction - the issue that was considered the cornerstone of relations with Japan. The details of the negotiations between the Russian and Japanese sides, the arguments of Russia in favor of the right of the Russian Consul General in Seoul to receive an exequatur not from the Japanese, but from the Korean emperor (the Japanese government insisted on the former) have been restored. For the first time, the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its representatives abroad tried to draw the attention of Western powers to the fact that Japan's demand for an exequatur to the Consul General in Korea was illegal and contrary to the established practice of international relations, and that Korea as a sovereign state had the right to maintain direct relations with other states, and foreign consuls had to receive exequatur from the territorial sovereign. The Foreign Ministry also proposed the initiative to raise the Korean issue for international discussion in order to achieve non-recognition by the powers of the Japanese protectorate and to condemn the actions of Japan in an international court. However, the initiative of Russia was not supported.
   With the appointment of A.P. Izvolsky, a supporter of a pragmatic course regarding the postwar settlement with Japan, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the line towards rapprochement with Japan prevailed in the Far Eastern policy of Russia. This had direct impact on the policy of the Russian government regarding Korea.

AB Introduction. There is a scientific, theoretical and practical necessity to understand modern phenomena of revolution and modernization. The political analysis of the influence of revolutionary events and modernization changes on the development of the Cossacks, not only as an ethnic community and social group, but as a kind of "world" that is currently undergoing a revival process, is of particular interest. Methods and materials. The paper relies on theoretical conclusions of researchers who specialize in the field of the theory of social change and development, political transitology, global studies, ensuring national and global security. Analysis. This paper presents the scientific analysis of socio-political practices of transformation of the Russian state and society in the historical perspective. The interrelation between the revolutionary events in Russia at the beginning of the 20 th century and the contemporary stage of the national modernization are traced. The author interprets the results of a survey devoted to public opinion of Russians regarding the causes and significance of the revolutionary process of 1917. The paper is focused on the correlation between "revolution" and "modernization" phenomena in the context of setting and achieving goals, tasks, using various technologies of social change. Results. The author characterizes the influence of modernization transformations on life activities of the ethnic community-the Cossacks. The article identifies the problematic aspects of the Cossacks' "revival" at the present stage of the socio-political modernization of Russia. The author proposes the integrative concept of the etatist model of the political modernization of Russia considering the parameters of stable and safe development.

   Organization
AB The article researches the activity of two large international economic and political structures, the Eurasian Economic Union and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, created in the post-Soviet space and includes a huge list of cooperation spheres, not the least - cooperation in education. Politically, Russian-Chinese relations are an important component of the modern system of international relations. The course of political and economic processes, at least within Eurasia, will largely depend on how relations between China and Russia develop. In recent years, bilateral relations between the two countries have been on the rise, which is expressed in the high growth rates of commodity circulation, expansion of investment cooperation, intensification of inter-regional and cross-border ties, and a marked increase in political dialogue and humanitarian interaction. Cooperation with China is crucial for the modernization of the Russian economy, giving it an innovative character and integration into the Asia-Pacific economic space. For Russia, relations with China are a priority in comparison with other Asian countries. In this regard, further development of partnership relations and strategic interaction with China is one of the main and, of course, priority and long-term policies of our country. Cooperation in the field of education is an integral element of strategic cooperation with Russia and China, which determines the relevance of the topic of our research.
   Preparing the article the authors pursued two main goals: to reveal particular qualities of the Russian-Chinese cooperation in the sphere of education and to analyze some characteristic features of the development in educational sphere in the frameworks of Eurasian Economic Union and Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Despite some correlative aspects of these two integrative structures, attitude towards the questions of education has a definite difference. The same thing can be said concerning Russian and Chinese systems of education regardless of the high level of cooperation between our countries.
   The authors used the following scientific methodology: the method of keys, the historic analytical method and the method of political analysis. The first mentioned method helped the authors to research the historical backgrounds of the Russian-Chinese cooperation on the whole and the development of their national educational systems - in particular. The method of keys provided a deep and precise analysis of the Russian and Chinese national educational systems. Finally, the method of political analysis made it possible to analyze the educational agenda in the frameworks of Eurasian Economic Union and Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
   In the final part of the research the authors came to the following conclusions: national system of Chinese education is successive to the Soviet one. At the same time, it is quiet paradoxical, but the Russian system is totally borrowed from the Western Europe. The second conclusion refers to the educational issue in the context of cooperation between the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The authors revealed a number of aspects which complicate the full-scale cooperation between these two institutes due to the crucial difference of the educational systems mentioned above.

AB This piece is a reaction to the series of articles on the state of IR discipline published in the previous issues of this journal. The authors emphasise the problems of IR theory in Russia (insufficient attention to the current IR trends, ideologization of theories and methods, which leads to numerous difficulties of integration of the Russian academic community into the world academic discussion). Particular attention is paid to the specificity of the formation of new theoretical approaches where interdisciplinary character is the key underlying principle. Ignoring it would seriously limit the capabilities and depth of Russian analytics. To illustrate these points, the article addresses the analysis of the EU Global Strategy - 2016 with 'resilience' as the key category. The article demonstrates inevitability of addressing theory for the sake of analysis of this document as well as for the study of EU-Russian relations at large. The first part of the article examines the specificity of how IR theory is addressed by the Russian academic community. The second part is devoted to the main problems of the contemporary discussion on the essence of IR. The third part gives an illustration of how theoretical approaches can be used to analyse one specific document, which is important for EU-Russian relations.

ID ALTERED STATES; CONSCIOUSNESS
AB This article presents the theory and practical application of a promising technique called sensorimotor psychosynthesis, which permits the induction of an altered state of consciousness in a patient. A state termed the entangled state in quantum physics and an empathy state in psychology emerges as the therapist (suggester) and the patient interact. The active dialogue between the suggester and the patient is the major distinctive feature of the sensorimotor psychosynthesis method and the major difference between this method and directive hypnosis. The authors describe a dynamic transformation of the worldviews (or mentality) in a number of patients during psychotherapy. This transformation occurred due to the construction of semantic spaces, a major psychosemantic approach to personality analysis, which involves the construction of a unique reality by the patient in an altered state of consciousness and the patient's existence in this reality, which conforms to the patient's desires and motives. Applications of the method in psychotherapy, sports, and criminal investigations are discussed.

DT Article
DE Renovationist Church; Great Patriotic war; Nazi occupation; Moscow
   Patriarchate; North Caucasus; Kuban; Leningrad
AB The article is devoted to the problem of political preferences of the renovationist episcopate in the USSR in 1941-1945. The author notes that, contrary to the popular opinion about the Pro-Soviet positions of all the bishops-renovationists in the temporarily occupied by the Nazis territory of the RSFSR, many of them were able to successfully return to their ministry, took the previously empty Episcopal chairs and actively carried out anti-Soviet propaganda. It is emphasized that in the territory free from occupation, the Renovationism leaders from the first days of the war stood actively on the Pro-Soviet position, called on believers to fight the enemy. The author proves that initially the Soviet government provided the Church with the same support as the sergians, and only after September 1943 a smooth preponderance of state preferences in favor of the "old churchmen" begins. Attention is paid to the fact that in the conditions of the end of the war many active figures of the Renovationist movement for a long time successfully competed with the Moscow Patriarchate, and then, when it was necessary to reunite with the Russian Orthodox Church, took all possible steps to preserve their own influence. The presented author's development is based on the materials of Russian archives, as well as modern scientific literature devoted to the problems of the history of religion during the Great Patriotic war and the study of divisions within the Russian Orthodoxy.

AB The article studies the effectiveness of Eastern Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia in terms of linking welfare, energy consumption, and sustainable development parameters. The research hypothesis: despite the conditions identity of the economic transformations of Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia, these countries have distanced themselves from maintaining a close correlation of the economic efficiency components and have determined their own optimal combination. The factual basis includes the data of the International Energy Agency, UnitedNations Organization, and national statistical databases. For evaluation of the economic efficiency of the post-Soviet countries, a specific quartet of components "welfare-economic growth-energy consumption-environment" has been analyzed via DEA analysis. It has been proved that, despite the political and historical community, each country has its own strategy, showing the absence of a close correlation between the efficiency components of the countries in the region examined. A typology of subregions of Eastern Europe, Caucasus, and CentralAsia has been developed. The obtained results can be applied as a supplement to the available approaches. They will allow identifying the most significant areas and empowering the unused reserves. The future research will focus on the comparison of the economic efficiency of post-Soviet and former socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe.

DE Bulgarian Anonymous Chronicle; Ottoman conquest of Balkans; Bulgaria;
   Serbia; Byzantium; Balkan history writing in the 15th-16th cc.
AB Introduction. The article analyzes. chronicle in the Slavo-Vallachian miscellany manuscript (mid 16th c.) ( currently in the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine in Kiev, Pochaev Lavra Collection, 116, l. 440a-447b). This text is known in scholarly literature as "Bulgarian anonymous chronicle". Usually it is considered as a wholesome work created in the early 15th c. by an unknown scribe, who followed the traditions of the Tyrnovo literary school and possessed Bulgarian ethnopolitical identity. There were hypotheses that the work was based upon Slavonic translation of a lost work by Byzantine writer John Chortasmenos or upon an early Slavo-Moldavian chronicle. Concentrating their attention on the contents of the chronicle as a historical source or trying to identify its author as one of the contemporary scribes known by name, scholars used to divide the text of the chronicle into parts due to their contents or main persons. The article aims to precisely attribute the chronicle's origin and composition, to separate its components and to connect them with the military and political events, as well as with the sociocultural environment of the orthodox Balkans in the early 15th c. Method. Applying the method of multi-level analytical decomposition of the text, the author reveals the chronicle's structure and considers the revealed parts in three contexts: the military and political situation in the Balkans during the first five decades of the Ottoman conquest (1352-1402); the social and cultural environment of the Southern Slavic and Greek polities and their literary heritage. Analysis. The chronicle is based on three extensive historical narratives concerning the first stage of the Ottoman invasion before the establishment of the Turks' control on crossing of the Gallipoli strait, the battle at Nicopolis in 1396 and the siege of Constantinople by Bayezid I in 1396-1402. They are connected with smaller stories on important episodes of the Ottoman conquest accompanied with historical notes integrated into the main text or left as marginal glosses. Three layers of the text differ with their composition and contents as well as with their language and style features, which allow to suppose that they had been created separately and became parts of the chronicle at its completion. Results. The chronicle was composed in the early 15th c. from several kinds of historical records. Extensive historical narratives reveal their Byzantine origin, while short records lead to Bulgarian and Serbian samples of history writing, and the whole work could be completed in a Slavonic scriptorium of a Vallachian or Mold.vian monastery, where its manuscript was copied for the Pochaev miscellanea in the mid 16th c., and in the early 17th c. used by Michail Moxa to compose his "General history" in Vlacho-Moldovian.

AB Cultural heritage conservation and preservation are at the forefront of the most important UNESCO activities. The World Heritage Convention adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 1972 encourages States Parties to strengthen the appreciation of the public for World Heritage properties and to enhance their protection through educational and information programs. The international student scientific Congress "Problems of cultural heritage preservation in multicultural education" was held on April 19, 2018 at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Financial University and the 100th anniversary of the St. Petersburg University of Culture in the form of a telecommunication session - 'bridge' between Moscow and St. Petersburg. The Congress was attended by the Embassy representatives of several countries. Around 100 students of the Financial University, Peoples ' Friendship University, St. Petersburg University of Culture, Saint-Petersburg Polytechnic University from Russia, representing Mongolia, Vietnam, Montenegro, the USA, Italy, Latvia, China, Kazakhstan, Venezuela took part in the virtual and real dialogue of cultures.
   The main objectives of the article are:
   to prove that the English language plays a truly unifying role, creating a comfortable environment for collaboration in the dialogue of cultures;
   to investigate what is necessary for the effective formation of verbal and non-verbal communication strategies in order to acquire professional linguistic knowledge, skills and abilities implementing a broad worldview culture, organic and tolerant perception of human values;
   to contribute to the students ' awareness of the cultural heritage of different countries and Russia cultivating their citizenship, especially in the current political situation.
   The relevance of the research problem is due to the growing needs of the modern Russian society and, in general, the world community in the development of polycultural education as one of the main factors in the conservation and development of the global cultural heritage and the strengthening of international cultural cooperation. The article considers the ways of solving this problem. We are convinced that the study of world Heritage Sites is an essential strategy for bringing people of different cultures together and for intercultural dialogue. Today we need a new approach to the transformation of cultural heritage into an innovative force that plays a leading role in the establishment of intercultural dialogue and sustainable development. One can conclude on the basis of the given experience results that it is necessary we have an open platform to unite theory and practice and to promote the development of dialogue among cultures within the framework of the main theme of Cultural Heritage on the Planet belonging to all of us.

AB The Constitution of the Russian Federation of 1993 provided the basis and tools for large-scale societal transformations in Russia. Still, the question of whether the results of political and socio-economic reforms are irreversible and in line with constitutional ideas and norms is open to discussion. This study investigates the temporality of the process of the "constitutionalization" of Russian law using the statistics of Federal laws and Federal constitutional laws for the period 1994-2018. The article presents the outcome of the quantitative analysis as well as a discussion of the findings involving the approaches of the legal and political sciences. The research leaves open the question of the relationship between the durability of the democratic constitution and the quality and irreversibility of democratic transformations of the social system. Monitoring the dynamics of the adoption of primary laws and laws on amendments gives evidence that even a "rigid" democratic constitution can become "elastic" with age since its ideas and meanings can often be "stretched" to apply to current cases without the need to make any changes to existing constitutional norms. The authors propose considering the conceptual possibilities of adaptive governance theory to explain the features of modern Russian lawmaking ("adaptive lawmaking," "agile lawmaking").

DT Article
DE radical right populist party; strategy; political space; qualitative
   comparative analysis
AB The article presents the results of a comparative research study aimed at identifying the conditions for victories and defeats of radical right populist parties in modern Europe. First, the author provides theoretical justification for why such victories and defeats depend on the strategy of both radical right populists and their competitors from the traditional party families along three problematic dimensions - economic, cultural and European. After that she elaborates a hypothesis that the success of a radical right populist party is a result of its convergent strategy along the economic dimension in conjunction with the prevalence of divergent strategies among the mainstream parties along the cultural and European dimensions and tests it on the data of 12 right populist parties using the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA).
   The empirical results partially confirm the hypothesis, identifying the link between the success of a radical right populist party and its commitment to a convergent economic strategy combined with the divergent strategies of the mainstream parties along the cultural and/or European dimensions. However, the research did not reveal the conditions for the defeat of such parties and did not explain the cases of Great Britain and France, where the radical right populists achieved notable success despite the fact that most identified conditions were absent. This begs further research with a focus on outliers. Such research may expand the list of success/defeat factors for radical right populists, taking into account the distribution of voters' preferences in various dimensions of the political space.

AB The publication analyzes the events that took place on August 19-21, 1991 in Moscow. It assesses the economic, social and political programme of the state Committee for emergency situations (GKCHP), which has declared itself the highest authority in the country. The planned activities of the GKCHP to stabilize the situation in it are shown. Special attention is paid to the characteristic of the attitude to the Moscow events in KHMAO-Yugra. There is a difference in the reflection on them of the Soviet and party apparatus of power in the North of Western Siberia. It is shown, in particular, on the one hand, the extreme rejection of the "coup attempt" of the Supreme Soviet authorities and their leaders, and, on the other, indicates the neutral, wait-and-see position of the local party elite.

DT Article

AB The article is devoted to studying shifts in the electoral behavior of young people in the USA, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Russia. A comparative analysis of the indicators of youth participation in national elections in four "canonical" Western democracies and the Russian Federation refutes the conventional wisdom that the younger generation has lost their interest in the electoral process, demonstrating the failure of linear predictions of electoral participation based on trends of the previous electoral cycles.
   The data presented in the article indicate that, contrary to the established stereotypes, today the rate of participation of young people in elections is increasing rather than decreasing. According to the author, this shows the flaw in the statement (which is widespread both in the Western and Russian scientific communities) about the erosion of traditional forms of political participation due to the change of generations and alteration in conditions of socialization. The growing popularity of alternative forms of political and civic activism among youth does not mean rejection of electoral procedures. Moreover, the electoral weight of young people is increasing, which makes it more relevant to study the behavior of youth in elections, in particular, applying the multivariate analysis.

TI WESTERN EUROPEAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY IN THE 21ST CENTURY: FROM
   MODERNIZATION TO CRISIS
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY

DT Article
DE social democracy; "Third Way"; global financial and economic crisis;
   globalization; multiculturalism; left traditionalism
AB The response of European social democracy to the crisis of the Keynesian socio-economic model that they created in the 1970s and 1980s was the market-oriented modernization of the social democratic parties. At the end of 20th - early 21st century, social democrats revised a number of principles of democratic socialism, borrowed some neoliberal concepts and almost completely abandoned the utopian elements in their ideology. The most active renewal processes were developed in the Labour Party of the United Kingdom under T.Blair, and in the Social Democratic Party of Germany under G.Schroder. However, the global financial and economic crisis of 2008 showed that social democrats lack a convincing alternative to neoliberalism. As a result, after 2008 social democracy faced new problems and challenges.
   From the point of view of the author, at present, European social democracy is in a state of crisis. There are several reasons for that. First of all, social democracy, which is in general a pro-globalist force, underestimates the negative consequences of globalization for its voters. It advocates a liberal migration policy and turns a blind eye towards the difficulties associated with the integration of immigrants into the European societies. Market-oriented modernization in the social democratic parties provokes resistance of the left-wing traditionalists, which can lead to internal party crises and splits or the success of the "hard left", such as J.Corbyn. The shift of social democracy towards social liberalism strengthens the left-populist parties (Syriza, Podemos, Unbowed France, etc.), which are becoming serious competitors to social democrats. It also contributes to the erosion of social democratic identity. Last but not least - social democracy is in intellectual stagnation and is not able to offer voters any fresh, original ideas. According to the author, European social democracy can achieve a real renewal only if it chooses the path of a creative synthesis of socialist, liberal and conservative ideas.

AB The successful promotion of Russia's social science and humanities journals indexed with international scientometric databases is based on the revised understanding of the quality of scientific publications in view of diverse and comprehensive criteria, with highly structured information as a frontrunner. Thoroughly formatted publication requirements are determined by excessive information flows and information overload in modern society and considered as a primary information-selection criterion highlighting adequate quality levels. The author conducted a study to single out prevailing types of publications among highly cited papers published in reputed journals specialized in international relations and political science. The research also aimed to find out what structuring and formats are typical of such journals and publications. Within the research, the author selected the top 100 most quoted papers in the field of international relations and political science in Scopus database brought out from 2013 to 2018 as well as another 70 articles published in 22 Scopus-indexed journals ranking Q1. The publications empirically proved that the most popular types of journal papers in the field cover original articles (encompassing both conceptual and research articles), and literature reviews. Analyzing 170 papers, the author singled out the typical formats for theoretical and empirical articles, defining the components that historically tend to lack from Russian scientific articles. Their absence often prevents Russian submissions to international established journals from being accepted, as they are required for international readership to rightly percept information. The recommendations by the author may be of use in encouraging Russian journals in the field of international relations and other social sciences to get adapted to the international standards of scientific publications and successfully evolve in pursuit of higher international journal rankings.

DT Article
DE infant mortality; "good governance"; democracy; autocracy; globalization
ID DEMOCRACY; HEALTH; GROWTH
AB The infant mortality rate (IMR) is one of the most important indicators of population health. Although today it has ceased to be a "mirror" of the general socio-economic situation in the country, its importance as an indicator of human development remains. At the same time, the recent years have witnessed the increasingly narrowing gap in IMR between democratic and authoritarian countries.
   Today, many researchers tend to believe that cross-country variation in the level of infant mortality can be explained by the quality of governance rather than the nature of the political regime. Having examined the theoretical arguments in favor of this conclusion, D.Rosenberg and A.Serova test this hypothesis on the extensive empirical data, developing and refining the previous studies along two directions. First, they include the factor of globalization as an additional mechanism that can potentially influence the level of infant mortality, thereby helping authoritarian countries catch up with democratic states. Second, they attempt to solve the problem of endogeneity i.e., to show the causal link between "good governance" and infant mortality. To assess the impact of "good governance" and globalization on infant mortality, they use a time-series cross-national regression analysis, and in order to prove the existence of causality they turn to an instrumental variable.

AB The purpose of the research is to examine the history of the formation in the public consciousness of the myth about Lev Aristidovich Kasso, who held the post of Minister of public education of the Russian Empire from September 1910 until his death in December 1914. In Soviet, Post-Soviet and Western historiography he was considered as a key figure, a symbol of conservative and repressive policy of autocracy in the field of higher education and science in general.
   The research is based on a wide range of historical sources, including political journalism, media, normative acts and official documents. Important for achieving the goals of the study were the memoirs and correspondence of representatives of the scientific community, in particular, the former Minister of public education Ivan Tolstoy, such professors, politicians and publicists as David Grimm, Alexander Izgoev, Konstantin Arsenyev, etc. This allowed authors to identify the stages of the formation of the myth about Lev Kasso in the period from autumn 1910 to the end of 1911.
   During the first months as a Minister, he was incognito to all political forces, including tsar Nicholas II. His first actions were criticized by the right politicians rather than the left. For a long time, Lev Kasso was considered as a "shadow", puppet in the hands of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers Pyotr Stolypin, that is why they did not see him as an independent and strong politician. The situation gradually had been changing during 1911. Hard and consistent repression against the revolutionary students, professors of Moscow and St. Petersburg universities demonized figure of Lev Kasso in the eyes of the liberal community.
   Particular outrage was caused by the Lev Kasso's project of training the professorial staff in foreign scientific centre, the dismissal of the opposition professors and the transfer ideologically closed to him professors from predominantly right-wing provincial universities in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. By that time Lev Kasso had been considered a symbol of the persecutions of tsarist power against traditional corporative subculture of Russian science and scientists. At the same time he became more popular among the right politicians. Significant role in growth of his political weight played the murder of Pyotr Stolypin in September 1911. Despite many rumors, Lev Kasso was not dismissed, but was perceived by some as a potential candidate for the vacant Post of Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE revolutionary waves; geopolitics; ideology; the cold war; communist
   revolutions; velvet revolutions; the level of violence in revolutions;
   the legitimacy of political regimes; post-revolutionary regimes
AB Revolutionary waves that unite successive interrelated revolutions represent macro-political wholes, which, on the one hand, have their own patterns of dynamics; on the other hand, they are included in regional and world processes. The article presents the conceptual framework of the approach, the main hypotheses about the dynamics of the revolutionary waves in these aspects, as well as the reasons for the characteristics of several waves of the second half of the 20th century: in Africa and the Caribbean Gulf approx. 1960, in Southeast Asia, 1950-1960s, in Central Europe in the late 1980s. Waves are influenced by geopolitical tensions, ideological trends, but they themselves change geopolitics, geo-economics, geo-culture on the corresponding continent or even in the whole world. Individual revolutions in each wave and the waves themselves are characterized by very different levels of violence. Sometimes they are affected by civil and/or international wars; sometimes they are rather peaceful. Post-revolutionary regimes are recognized to varying degrees by opposing coalitions of powers as well as by global international organizations. This is always connected with positions in ideological struggle, with political and military support, as well as with the scale of homicide, and (non)justification of the admitted violence. Thus, geopolitics, violence and legitimacy of revolutionary waves constitute a single dynamic complex with regularities that are revealed on the historical data mentioned above.

ID REGULAR STATE; ORIGIN
AB Medieval Europe before the Reformation and Moscow Russia before the Troubles are viewed in an ideally-typical manner as carriers of basic social and mental unities: faith and church organization, sacred empire as the Rome's usccessor, basic social relations. As a result of the Reformation and the religious wars each of the European unities was destroyed, but parts of the former Pax Christiana continued to closely interact and compete with each other, to fight for leadership, that led to intensive modernization of the leading Western European powers with known global consequences. Moscow State after the Time of Trouble restored its unity in all three aspects. The features of the state and society here were significantly transformed as a result of the Schism, the formation of the Russian empire, administrative reforms of the 18-19 centuries, but the basic properties of etatism, centralism, priority of service, and power instrumentalization of the moral and religious sphere remained. The Russian social-political cycles have the phases: successful mobilization, stagnation, crisis, attempts of liberalization, authoritarian scroll-back. The cyclical dynamics is explained by the interrelation of the following factors: 1) the primacy of military-compulsory ("colonial") administration as a means of retaining and managing vast territories; 2) the state priorities of military power, size of the territory, and the volume of export products; 3) the order of military service as a basic model for political and social institutions; the corresponding weakness of autonomous capital and business activity; 4) the mental, cultural and property gap (lack of vertical solidarity) between the elites and the bulk of the population. 5) the monopoly of state religion (or forced atheism). Thus, unity of political power, religious and ideological monopoly can lead a country to military triumphs and even geopolitical success for decades but in the longue duree this unity generates vulnerability.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE psychohistory; psychoideology; Russian idea; political narcissism;
   shadow and latent ideology; internal dialogue; ideological postmodernism
AB The concept of psychoideology is introduced in the context of the psychohistory approach (Lloyd DeMause). Philosophy tends to analyze ideologies primarily as content, that is, in terms of the generation and relationship of ideas, their filiation and constellation. Less often, the psychological complexes and emotional responses associated with ideologies are taken into account. However, in the key moments of creation and influence of ideas, it is personal and collective, mass experiences that can play a decisive role. These aspects are especially important in non-classical situations of latent, shady and diffuse, "penetrating" ideology. In contrast to the notions of ideology exclusively as "consciousness for the Other", the text considers ones own personal psychoideology. In the internal opposition "friend-enemy" are reproduced all the standard functions of ideological work and struggle. Own censorship of the inner dialogue and speech filters what a person can or cannot say to himself/herself. To identify the structures of psychoideology, methods of compiling compositional psychological portraits of entire ideological lines are used, as well as a biographical analysis of the origin and initial design of basic ideas.

ID CONDITIONALITY; ACCESSION; MEMBERSHIP
AB According to many experts, the desire to join the EU has played an important role in the Europeanization and democratization of the countries of the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). According to the external incentives model, which has become widespread among the European integration researchers, these countries succeeded in assimilating the liberal democratic norms due to the credible prospect of joining the EU as well as favorable internal circumstances that ensured low domestic costs of implementing relevant reforms.
   The studies on the EU 2004 enlargement, which affected mainly CEE countries, confirmed that the credible prospect of entering the EU and low domestic costs indeed contribute to the democratic consolidation of the candidate countries. However, the possible effects of the subsequent enlargement are less clear. Although the EU has not abandoned its enlargement policy, its ability to promote democracy further to the East, including the Western Balkan region, is often under question.
   The article attempts to determine whether the model of external incentives can explain more complex cases than the CEE countries. On the basis of the comparative analysis of the current situations in the two Western Balkan countries - Croatia, which entered the European Union in 2013, and Serbia, which is a candidate country, T.Rudneva concludes that the model of external incentives retains its explanatory power for these cases. At the same time, her research indicates that due to the high domestic costs of reforms and a lower prospect of joining the EU, the process of EU accession of the Western Balkan countries will be slower and perhaps less successful than it was in the case of CEE, and its Europeanizing and democratizing influence will be more limited.

DE Ersatz-elite; Russia; North Caucasus; tribalism; region; tensions
AB The elite includes various social groups, depending on the methodological principles and preferences of researchers. One of the main characteristic of an elite is the possession of power resources, authority and mobilization potential. A political elite is a group in a society, relatively homogeneous, making decisions, occupying administrative and managerial positions. Major inherent features of any elite include the presence of scrupulous integrity and aspiration to the growth of public good. Modern political discourse believes that no elites per se are currently present which leads to the proverbial question: is it elite or ersatz-elite? Possessing power for the sake of power, accumulating and augmenting one's own financial and economic resources, opportunism, lack of social responsibility define ersatz-elites rather than elite groups. The elite is replaced by a macrosocial group that only looks like an elite, without innovative guidelines and principles. This work is not aimed at distinguishing integral and universal features of both notions, it is only focused on the description of functioning and the strategy of ersatz-elite activities in the social and cultural environment of North Caucasus. The researchers are also interested in ethnocracy, the tribal structure of elite incorporation, persistency, weak vertical and horizontal mobility. North Caucasus is the area prone to conflicts, ethnic and political tensions, territorial and ethnic disputes and disturbance. The ability of authoritative elites to covertly mimick, circulate and function is critical for its vitality and correlation with the federal political and administrative elites.

DE Komuch; social policy; civil war; political regime; legislation;

AB Social policy was one of the most important components of politics in Komuch, most fully reflecting the specifics of a "third way" in the Civil War. Historiographical analysis shows that, until now, scholarly attention has focused on its individual aspects, and a holistic view has not yet been created. The article reveals specifics of interactions between the authorities and society in Komuch. Inclusion of many heterogeneous associations in the decision-making process led to the formation of a polycentric model for developing social policy, which was implemented as a result of the interaction of different political forces. The main facets of Komuch social policy included regulating property relations, social and labor spheres, assistance to refugees, support for military personnel and their families, social transfers, and education policy. Except for the first two, these policies remained in their infancy. Along with beginning to return property, the Volga government continued seizures, and transferred most of what was nationalized to local governments. Numerous prescriptions in the field of workers' legislation focused on establishing a social compromise, to the achievement of which there were no material and political prerequisites. Komuch sought to minimize social spending, to free up the state apparatus by shifting social obligations to local governments, entrepreneurs, and public organizations. Assistance to socially disadvantaged groups was episodic, mainly at the last stage of the existence of the Komuch authorities and aimed mainly at helping state officials. Regulatory prescriptions were not consistent with declarations and did not correspond to main main groups' ideas about social justice and could not be realized in the current social situation. Local governments, the army, powerful public corporations, such as trade unions, business organizations, neighborhood councils and others, ignored the prescriptions of the authorities and acted on their own interests.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE property rights; political organization; Soviet housing policy; routine
   resistance; Soviet and post-Soviet daily interactions; material
   infrastructure; daily politics
AB In this article, we apply the concepts of 'everyday politics' and 'routine resistance' to explain the transformation of political organization and property relations in housing practices in Soviet and post-Soviet Russia. Specifically, we discuss how property relations were reformed during the Soviet period and how they affected the daily life of ordinary people. We show that Soviet political organization molded a specific ideology in an attempt to change rationality and everyday life. In accordance with Marxist ideology, the control over people's minds led to control over material things. As a result, the ruling party and its members dominated without possessing formal property rights, while the production of the ideology and the molding of a "new Soviet citizen" was conditioned by a number of incoherent, diffuse and omnipresent actions by representatives of the Communist Party, administrative units and ordinary people. Routine resistance prevented the complete disappearance of private property relations. Despite its formal non-existence in the Soviet era, private property did exist, albeit vested in a specific cultural form (e.g. in the practices of pseudo-market selling, exchange and inheritance). Such forms of routine resistance in the Soviet period were one of the factors that contributed to the political reorganization of the early 1990s. The ensuing difficulties in the implementation of private property relations that followed were largely due to the resistance of the `material infrastructure' from the Soviet era. This material infrastructure continues to influence routine resistance, for example, people do not want to own collective property or they evade payment for it. As a result, housing as a material object has become one of the important causes of the unsuccessful market transformation in Russia. Empirically we draw on the descriptions of Soviet housing practices in the academic literature and the data collected during many years of observations in St. Petersburg and Blagoveshchensk, in a village in the Amur Region.

DE China; Venezuela; power crisis; debt crisis; economic cooperation;

AB The article discusses political and economic stance of China on the current crisis of power in Venezuela. The author proceeds from the fact that directions and "supporting pillars- of Chinese interests in Venezuela are due not only to the importance of Venezuelan natural resources for China's economy, but also to the growing significance of Latin America in China's foreign policy as such.
   The article identities Beijing's strive to involve Latin America in the plans of China's Belt and Road Initiative as the latest and most important motive for the enhancement of Chinese policy towards Latin America and Venezuela in particular.
   As for Chinese -Venezuelan practical economic ties, the article argues that their current status is largely determined by the crisis in Venezuelan debt to China. However, the author considers the scale of Venezuelan hydrocarbon reserves and the considerable length of time, necessary for their elaboration, to he powerful long-term factors of China's interest in Venezuela, allowing to maintain the volume of Chinese -Venezuelan economic contacts, and in the future to bring them to a new level. Therefore it seems, that the debt crisis will be alleviated (thanks to the political will of Beijing mostly) because of the high interest of both parties in their further cooperation.
   Nowadays, the peculiarity of Chinese investment in Venezuela is that investment goes not only to projects on the extraction of natural resources, but also most importantly to process basic Venezuelan raw materials and semi -finished items into high value added products. Such investment and production scheme can also be applicable in other countries of Latin America which has better industrial experience than most other regions of the developing world. The author draws attention to the fact that soon the number of China's competitors for the access to Venezuelan natural resources may increase at the expense of India and Turkey, which prefer to buy natural resources for "ready" currency (much needed by Venezuela), rather than to import them against loans and credits previously provided.
   The article stresses the specificity of the PRC's position on the Venezuelan crisis, which consists in supporting the government of N.Maduro along with carrying out consultations with all parties to the conflict in search of peaceful solution to the problem and clarification of the fate of Chinese assets in any development of events. The author notes constructiveness and rationality of such a line.

DE Russia; the North Caucasus; political elites; political process;
   structure; conflicts
AB The North Caucasus is a complex and depressive region of Russia, mainly inhabited by autochthonous peoples who profess Islam and Christianity. A high degree of politicization, ethnicity, clan system, strong tribal connections create the ground for conflict behavior in governing interactions. The main factor in the North Caucasus are the local, regional ethno-political elites, which consist of tajpovost, familnosti, and tukumnost. This article details the process of structuring and behavioral models of elites. The formation of political elites takes place on a closed, guild model, and the incorporation is carried out by entourages on the basis of informal criteria. The authors keep to the reputational approach to the definition of the elite, with its correlation by divisional and altimetric approaches. The presence of real power, formal and latent levers of pressure, influence on decision-making determines the very essence of political elites in the North Caucasus. Such inconsistency and poor quality of elites leads to the emergence of new and escalation of old conflicts, ethnocracies often use for their own mercantile purposes the historical memory of peoples, unresolved territorial disputes, injustice, social differentiation and other problems. The events of 1992 around the disputed suburban area of North Ossetia-Alania, the internal Russian-Chechen conflict of 1994-1996 and 1999-2000, new points of ethno-political tension in Ingushetia, interethnic clashes in Kalmykia, Kabardino-Balkaria indicate the presence of high conflict potential in the region. Archaism, poorly developed institutions of civil society, economic backwardness of the region lead to permanent tension and conflicts. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

DE The North Caucasus; elites; extremism; terrorism; conflicts; separatism
AB Due to historical, sociocultural specifics and geopolitical significance, the North Caucasus is still a zone of ethno-political tension and confrontation of various political systems. Against this background, the display, development and escalation of various conflicts, extremism and Wahhabism is high frequent. The study considers the features of displaying and developing extremism and terrorism in the North Caucasus in the context of the activities of ethno-political elites.
   Political elites are the central actors of the political process in the region. They possess legitimacy, administrative resources and influence. Experts understand that in the conditions of the North Caucasus the ethno-political elites are the subject of preparing, making and implementing strategic and tactical decisions. In the context of this work, it is important to consider the elites' social practices on countering and blocking the factors of terrorism and extremism in the region. The leaders of the of the Russian North Caucasian regions very successfully struggle against the ideology and practice of terrorism and extremism, and the ethnic elites of certain republics of the region cope with this task much better.
   The study offers formulated recommendations that can contribute to blocking extremism and terrorism in the context of the regional political process. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Middle East; Arab nationalism; pan-Arabism; the Nahda; pan-Turkism;
   Palestine; Zionism; the Great Arab Revolt; the First World War
AB The article is dedicated to the emergence of the Arab national movement at the beginning of the 20th century. This topic is still relevant in our days since revealing the origins of political and social processes in the Middle East of the 21st century is necessary for their understanding. The main issues which are considered by the author are the following: which factors had crucial influence on the emergence of Arab nationalism (panarabism as well as regionalism), when exactly it was formed and what were the specifics of its emergence in Palestine.
   The author defines three main periods in the genesis and formation of the Arab national movement at the beginning of the 20th century. The first is the Nahda, the Arab cultural revival of the second half of the 19th century, which became a foundation for the later development of nationalist ideas. However, the author tries to show that the cultural revival itself was not nationalistic. The second key period is the political expression of the Arab national movement in the first decades of the 20th century, with the ottomanist and later pan-Turkist policy of the Ottoman government having the decisive influence. This policy was nationalist in essence. Zionism, as noted in the text, was not such an important issue for the nascent pan-Arab movement before the First World War, although it caused concern among the locals in Palestine. The third key stage, that was decisive in the Arab national development, is the Great Arab Revolt, which, despite the fact that it was not massive and universal, forced the pan-Arab movement enter the international arena for it attracted the attention of the great powers - mainly with the help of McMahon-Hussein correspondence. In result, during the postwar settlement, pan-Arabism became more popular and internationally recognised phenomenon, although eventually it happened to be divided into a multitude of regional movements, in particular - Palestinian nationalism fostered by the Anglo-French division of influence zones in the Middle East.
   In general, the formation of the Arab national movement was a multidimensional and gradual phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors. At the same time, the emergence of the regional groups had its own specifics; originally belonging to the Pan-Arab movement, although with their own features, after the First World War these groups became largely independent.

   text
AB The article is devoted to the discussion of the new issue of Vesti-Kuranty, a large project of the V. V. Vinogradov Russian Language Institute, spanning almost half a century and performed by a whole team of authors. Vesti-Kuranty are Russian foreign press reports, a sort of medieval digests from the most recent publications about the main events in the political life of the 17th century. The content of the seventh volume allows one to trace the development of publishing techniques of this special type of documents compiled by the diplomatic workers of the capital (government officials of the Ambassadorial Order) and intended for the chosen audience - only the Russian government, that is, the Tsar and the Boyars duma. Since the publication of the first volume in 1972, the structure of the work has fundamentally changed, since the Russian digest texts are now published side-by-side with their identified foreign sources; the researchers go to the finest detail to explain all the different methods of message composing, which have been based on a vast amount of information (including that which was missing in the originals, but was well-known by the Russian clerks). Vesti-Kuranty is one of the most valuable sources on the history of Russian foreign policy, the literary and political language of the educated segment of Moscow society, their perceptions and attitudes towards the artifacts of foreign cultures. The author of this review thinks that the methods of publication of Vesti-Kuranty will continue improving. The publishers are forced to test different ways of presenting the text to their readers, because each new issue of Vesti contains more and more material from year to year as new facts are uncovered.

DE Carl Hagenbeck; ethnic exhibition; human zoo; Russia; USSR; colonialism;
   political identity
AB The heyday of ethnic exhibitions in Europe and the USA was from the mid-19th century until the end of the 1930s, when the development of ethnographic cinema, as well as political events related to World War II, the Holocaust, and decolonization made such exhibitions unpopular. In particular, the demonstrations of "savages" in zoos, as if anticipating the reduction of people to an animal state in concentration camps, have become an odious example of the inhumanity of colonialism. In the USSR, such exhibitions were consistently condemned, which was consonant with the general anticolonial rhetoric of the Soviet government since the 1920s. It is all the more surprising that the USSR published books by one of the main organizers of the "human zoos" Carl Hagenbeck. The article discusses the features of representing the activities of Hagenbeck in the USSR by the example of the 1957 publication of his book "On Beasts and Men". Both the Soviet preface to the book and the illustrations show that Hagenbek's activity was interpreted mainly positively, and even more so, as a worthy example for educating the young generation of Soviet citizens. An appeal to the young reader, giving the book a pedagogical character, distinguishes the 1957 edition from both the pre-revolutionary edition of 1912 and the early German editions of the book of Hagenbeck. The fact that a new translation was made for the 1957 edition testifies to the special significance attached to this book. A study of Hagenbeck's reception reveals how, despite the anti-colonial foreign policy rhetoric, elements of colonial culture were reproduced and normalized in Soviet society in the second half of the 1950s through the discourse of popular science, becoming part of the political identity of Soviet people. Attention is also paid to the economic contacts of the USSR with the Hagenbeck company in the interwar period, which made it possible to make export of animals a source of significant foreign exchange earnings, as well as to the importance of Hagenbeck 's approaches for Soviet circus art, which also contributed to a positive perception of the activities of this German businessman.

DE media stereotype; Europe; migration crisis; refugees
AB This article is devoted to the problem of the migration crisis of 2015-2016. in Europe and the reflection of this problem in media texts. The current stage of development of society is characterized by the increasing influence of journalism on all spheres of life and human activity. The greatest influence in this context is television, which for many Russian citizens is the most accessible source of information. Analyzing the state of the participants of the modem migration crisis according to reports in the Russian media, we came to the conclusion that it is necessary to turn to the works of European researchers who see the situation from the inside. We studied media stereotypes about migrants and refugees, presented in a report by the international group of researchers from the Department of Media and Communications of the London School of Economics and Political Science and published in 2017 the report "The European migration crisis and the media. A cross-European press content analysis". Migrants and refugees are a vulnerable minority that can easily suffer from the internal problems of the host country.

AB Even a superficial glance at the current political situation in Western countries is sufficient to understand an ambiguous position of modern liberalism. The liberal ideology advocates for social justice through the priority of individual freedom in society. Moreover, liberalism defines freedom as independence of an individual, which is limited by the very freedom of autonomous individuals and by self-control only. The conception of economics in liberalism depends on the initial formal equality of existing opportunities. Liberalism itself stands for economic equality. All individuals as owners and citizens are vested with equal formal political and legal rights. At the same time, actual economic inequality is unambiguously declared as a legitimate result of an individual's efforts. The conception of social justice of liberalism was a new impetus to a discussion on further development of liberal ideology and political strategies. The consequences of practical implementation of the theory are currently difficult to predict accurately, however liberal practice incontrovertibly lags behind theory. Modern liberalism does not obviously believe in civilization of productivity, but it cannot dispute its hegemony either. This fits the description of the provisions of current liberalism that put forward attractive ideals, which require reforms that are more global in nature.
   The relations between modern liberal theory and traditional liberal politics are becoming obscure. In most aspects, they are not interrelated, although contrary to theories (radical and critical ones), liberalism itself is often referred to as a "dominant" political theory.

AB In the article the analysis of interethnic relations in Kabardino-Balkaria in the context of the sustainable development of the peoples of Kabardino-Balkaria from the point of view of the Russian population is presented. The degree of the national identity development of Russians has been revealed. The article shows that national identity as a political category, allows to fit into the general socio-political structure of Kabardino-Balkaria, uniting Russians into a socio-political group and a political institution. During the study, the degree of hostility in Kabardino-Balkaria to representatives of other nationalities was identified. The important direction in sociology concerning inter-ethnic marriages, which are one of the channels for changing the socio-demographic structure of society, was studied. Analyzing the dynamics and nature of development of interethnic marriages, it seems possible to understand their social nature, the ways of forming local subcultures and the interaction of social and ethnic processes, and to give them a scientific justification for resolving conflicts on interethnic grounds. The revealing thing was the fact that there are no harsh nationalistic judgments in the reasoning of the Russians, and there is no religious antipathy. It is also shown that in conditions of political, legal and social chaos, one of the fundamental values is safety and a sense of legal security. The degree of confidence regarding the future and the guarantee of protection, regardless of nationality, were revealed. Finally, it was concluded that the degree of social resistance and the ethnic conflict potential of the Russian population of Kabardino-Balkaria are low.

AB Nowadays the world economy is on the way to the sixth technological way to which continuous innovative process is peculiar. Each technological period forms a certain set of innovations directed to the sustained economic growth. In the developed countries from 40% to 90% of the growth of the gross domestic product is formed due to high technologies. For Russia, which is in the sphere of political and economic sanctions, one of the main forces in formation of sustainable development there have to be science and technology parks. Their main objective is creation and advance of scientific and technical business. Diversification and new technologies are very important for Russia which is in rather dense technological dependence on a number of foreign countries today. It is on the basis of the retrospective analysis of emergence and development of science and technology parks in country aspect, the qualitative analysis of changes of the comparative characteristic of the technological processes accompanying development of territorial and industrial complexes and creation of the knowledge-intensive competitive production. Having studied the criteria and practice of formation and functional development of territorial and industrial complexes in the developed countries, it is obviously possible to make the conclusion that nowadays Russia has to provide serious breakthrough in the scientific and technical sphere, relying on experience of the developed countries and considering features of the national industry and economy as the scheme "fundamental science - applied science - production" is broken off.

DE E. Chetvergov; story; concept; history; personality; the era of
   collectivization; reflection
AB Introduction: the problem of "a man and history" in modern Mordovian prose requires a multi-aspect scrupulous study, because it allows not only to reveal the original creative preferences and aesthetic concepts, but also to reveal the philosophical meaning of the triad "past - present - future". The problems actualized in the article fit into the context of the analytical field of modern Finno-Ugric literary criticism. The object of the research is the specificity of artistic understanding of history of the state, the construction of the relationship between the world order and a personality in the early 1930s in the story by E. Chetvergov "Sweet Wormwood".
   Objective: to research the individual-author's concept of history and a man, forms of interrelation of reality and personality, alternation of traditional peasant way of life and socio-political changes of the 1930s, the psychological process of self-realization of the personality in the story by E. Chetvergov "Sweet Wormwood".
   Research materials: the story of the modern Erzya writer E. Chetvergov "Sweet Wormwood". We used both traditional literary research methods (structural-descriptive, structural-semantic, cultural-historical, comparative) and modern approaches of the humanitarian profile (axiological, hermeneutical). The article also contains an interdisciplinary approach.
   Results and novelty of the research: in the article the story by E. Chetvergov "Sweet Wormwood" for the first time becomes the object of scientific reflection. In the course of discussions on the research topic, the authors come to the conclusion that the analyzed work contrasts sharply with the canons of socialist realism; the author refuses to differentiate characters according to social characteristics, assesses their psychological state and moral potential, advocates for the revival of the traditional peasant world order.

AB This publication introduces into scientific use and analyzes three documents found in a file in the declassified series in the fond of the Siberian Revolutionary Committee stored in the State Archive of the Novosibirsk Region. These documents are personal letters written by N. Ya. Bykhovsky and I. I. Ignatovich-Bykhovskaya in Irkutsk in summer 1921. They were well-known researchers and social and political figures. N. Ya. Bykhovsky was a professional revolutionary. For nearly twenty years, he was a member of the SR party and one of the party outstanding publicists; he was elected a member of the party Central committee. His wife, I. I. Ignatovich-Bykhovskaya, also a member of the SR party, had by 1921 abandoned political activity and was engaged mainly in teaching and studying the history of Russian peasantry of the 19th century. The letters are addressed to the chairman of the Siberian Revolutionary Committee I. N. Smimov, who was then a candidate member of the Central Committee of the RCP(B) and belonged to the Bolshevist elite. N. Ya. Bykhovsky and I. I. Ignatovich-Bykhovskaya had to write to I. N. Smirnov repeatedly, because mid June 1921 N. Ya. Bykhovsky had been arrested in Irkutsk by the order of the plenipotentiary representative of All-Union Extraordinary Commission for Siberia I. P. Pavlunovsky. The arrest was made despite guarantees that I. N. Smirnov had given shortly before in Omsk, when he had met N. Ya. Bykhovsky twice. The letters were attempts to find out, why N. Ya. Bykhovsky had been arrested, even though he had been no longer involved in party and political work. The Bykhovskys offered several explanations of what had happened. However, the explanation of I. P. Pavlunovsky seems the most likely: as he said cynically to I. I. Ignatovich-Bykhovskaya, in certain moments of political life of the country, active and influential public figures "must be imprisoned." A shrewd historian will also find in the published letters other interesting data on political mentality and culture of the Bolsheviks, Soviet reality, and everyday life in the early 1920s.

TI GIFT-EXCHANGE AS NARRATIVE AND METAPHOR
SO LOGOS
LA English
DT Article
DE rhetoric of economic science; economic anthropology; reciprocity; gift
   exchange
AB The article deals with characteristic features of economic anthropology's rhetoric of reciprocity and analyzes the factors that affected its formation. The authors consider two principal interpretations of reciprocity in economic anthropology that were formed under the influence of its two main founders - Malinowski and Mauss. The characteristic features of their two types of rhetoric are discussed together with the purposes for which they were used. Two different intentions were pivotal for the work of these researchers and their followers: first, to establish economic anthropology as a positivistic science; and second, to use the analysis of archaic societies as evidence for their critique of a capitalistic economy.
   To achieve the first task they actively used rhetoric borrowed from the natural sciences, and especially from biology as well as from economic theories that were another social science also striving for a more rigorous positivism. For the second task they turned to the rhetoric of political economy and used arguments based on a dialectical opposition between commodity exchange and gift exchange. The most prominent example of such dialectical rhetoric is in the works of Chris Gregory and Karl Polanyi in which gift exchange was interpreted as a metaphor for a utopian alternative to capitalistic commodity exchange. Because the rhetoric of economic anthropology from its inception to the present has been profoundly influenced by the language of general economic theory, the article examines the genesis of the rhetoric of economics as a science. This leads to an analysis of how the language of economics was affected by the rhetoric of the natural sciences, then of psychology and finally of law.

AB The secret political organisation known as the Ukrainian Slavic Society of Sts Cyril and Methodius (the Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius) was suppressed in the spring of 1847. The Brotherhood proclaimed that its goal was to create Slavic democratic republics and unite them into an alliance with its centre in Kiev. The methods of achieving this goal remained unclear. The society itself, according to the investigation, consisted of only three people, including N. I. Kostomarov who later became a famous historian. Count A. F. Orlov, head of the Third Department of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery (the secret police of the Russian Empire) did not consider such a small organisation a serious threat. The count named the poet and artist T. G. Shevchenko and the prose writer and folklorist P. A. Kulish the most "important criminals" arrested in the case. At the same time, Orlov did not consider them members of the society but characterised them as "Ukrainophiles" (he might have been the first person to use this term). In their works, Shevchenko and Kulish glorified the Ukrainian past, the Hetmanate, and the freedom of the Cossacks (volnitsa), conveying the possibility and desirability of an independent Ukrainian state to the reader. Similar to the majority of defendants in this case, Kulish was deported to one of the Great Russian provinces. The punishment Shevchenko received was severer: he was sent to Orenburg as a private. Emperor Nicholas I also issued a special order forbidding the poet to write or draw. Shevchenko characterised his ten-year Orenburg exile (1847-1857) as the most painful period of his life. It is a commonly-held opinion that the exile received support from some officers who did not occupy significant posts (Lieutenant A. I. Butakov and Major I. A. Uskov). The paper shows that the patrons of Shevchenko were generals V. A. Obruchev and V. A. Perovsky, the military governors of Orenburg region and commanders of the corps. The poet himself spoke of them negatively.

In the latter half of the 1940s. the state changed its settings and started the fight against "kowtowing to the West". Thus, the Great Patriotic War was a turning point in the history of national science and technology, and changed political implications of Soviet technological projects.

Nikitin [Gaman-Golutvina, Nikitin 2019], prepared by a team of leading Russian political scientists. The book is actually the first in Russia systemic presentation of the main methodological approaches used in modern political science. The methodology of political science for a long time remained a "stepdaughter" in the family of political science publications, and the growing interest in politics and political research was not accompanied by the emergence of large-scale, original works devoted to the analysis of the methodological foundations of political science. Meanwhile, the need for the development of a methodological foundation, which is present in any field of scientific knowledge, becomes especially urgent in dynamically developing research directions. The article presents the characteristics of more than 30 methodological strategies and paradigms prevailing in the world political science. The author examines the structure of the monograph, reveals the principles of the construction of chapters and discusses the heuristic problems that have been solved in this publication.

TI Documents of the Revolutionary Events Participant G. P. Permyakov in the
   Merged Personal Provenance Fond from the State Archive of

DT Article
DE Personal provenance sources; archival documents; October Revolution of
   1917; Civil War; archive
AB The possibility to preserve historical memory by transmitting information from one generation to another in contemporaries' perception of the events does not lose its relevance today. On the basis of personal provenance sources this article demonstrates the evolution G. P. Permyakov's views. G. P. Permyakov was a hero of the Revolution and the Civil War; at first an ardent Bolshevik, he later became more restrained in assessing revolutionary changes. The life of G. P. Permyakov is reflected in his diary notes, correspondence with friends, memoirs, and autobiographical data, which allow both to reconstruct the events with great accuracy and to see how contemporaries' views changed over time, whether their expectations were fulfilled in the Soviet time. Materials of G. Permyakov's personal provenance fond stored in the State Archive of Social and Political History of the Tyumen Region provide an opportunity to enrich the collective memory which presently draws more on institutional, rather than individual experience. The G. P. Permyakov's collection is quite unique, as it includes materials related to different periods of his life. The 1920s documents are permeated with enthusiasm for the success of the revolution and hopes for a better future. There are no materials from 1930s to mid - 1950s in the collection, as during that time he did not carry on his correspondence with friends. The correspondence only resumed during the preparation for the 40th anniversary of the revolution. In late 1950s a new assessment of the revolution and the Civil War appeared in G. Permyakov's manuscripts. It clearly shows his disappointment in the results of the Soviet state construction. Information value of the G. P. Permyakov's collection comes from materials from different periods of his life with theirs varying assessments. This allows researchers to approach understanding of large-scale historical events from the perspective of an individual.

TI POLITICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS OF THEORY OF GIFT
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE theory of gift; aporia of gift; totalitarianism; power; free will;
   predestination; money; alienation; origin of law
AB The theory of gift, used today mainly in Anthropology, has a considerable heuristic potential for other humanities. The article represents an attempt to apply this theory to politics and law.
   In the political sphere, the theory of gift opens up a possibility of novel approaches to understanding the nature of political conflicts, especially in the societies that undergo a crisis, transition etc. The author does not intend to cover all such approaches and focuses only on some of them. In particular, the author draws attention to the enormous energy hidden in those structures, relations, and political instincts that remained from the system of gifts. He proposes a hypothesis that the political cataclysms of the last century can be explained (along with other reasons) by the attempts to restore relations of gift that grew out of the active participation of broad masses in politics, which led to the reduction of state and law into the direct connection between the masses and the leader.
   The author explains the disintegration of the system of gifts by the advent of money, which he views as one of the most large-scale factors of social transformation. Money called into existence a contract of purchase and sale as a negotiation about a price, which laid foundation for the whole system of modem law. Because a binding decision on price is possible only under the condition of free will of parties to a contract, the author considers that buying and selling became a source of free will that went beyond the law.
   In the final part of the article, the author turns to the legal implications of the theory of gift. First, he acknowledges the inability of Legal Science to provide a convincing answer to both the question of the nature of money and genesis of law. After that he shows that the theory of gift allows for a deeper understanding of the basic legal concepts, which in turn can be useful for solving many legal issues that cannot be resolved within the framework of the established doctrines.

AB The subject. At the present stage, the real ideal of legal democracy is ensuring the right of citizens to participate in the management of state affairs, in particular, to elect and be elected to public authorities and to elected public office. The fundamental basis of democracy in a democratic state is free elections. In this regard, the substantive content of the constitutional-legal model of free elections in Russia is considered.
   The purpose of the paper. Recently, it is impossible not to note the tendency to narrow the legal understanding of free elections to "the absence of coercion to vote in elections". At the same time, the real understanding of free elections as a democratic value is much broader. Ensuring the constitutional principle of democracy, the improvement of domestic legislation and electoral law determine the study of the substantive content of the domestic constitutional legal model of free elections.
   The methodology of the study. The achievement of this goal was promoted by the use of both general scientific and special methods of cognition of social and legal phenomena (comparative legal method, method of legal modeling).
   The main results and scope of their application. The position of the author indicated in the work is based on the regulatory legal acts in the field of elections, judicial practice, as well as on the opinions of representatives of legal science in the framework of the problems of real meaningful content of free elections. As a result of the study, a three-part substantive content of the domestic constitutional legal model of free elections is substantiated.
   Conclusions. It is concluded that the free formation of their political behavior by participants in the electoral process (voters, candidates, electoral associations) is an integral element of the meaningful content of free elections and in combination with free and voluntary participation in elections, the free will represents a ternary component rather than a binary component.

AB Jacob (Yakov Yakovlevich) von Staehlin (1709-1785), thanks to his talents, various activities and contacts at the imperial court, was one of the most influential members of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. His correspondence with his son, Petr (Pyotr) Yakovlevich Staehlin (1744-1800), who was a member of the Russian diplomatic service, was preserved in the family archive (Russian National Library, Manuscript Department: about 400 letters in French). The letters of Jacob von Staehlin himself represent a peculiar chronicle of St. Petersburg: the Academy of Sciences, the College of Foreign Affairs, the imperial court, theatre and music, fine arts, etc. His son's letters reflect his daily life and activities of the Russian diplomat in The Hague. Prince D. A. Golitsyn, a naturalist, an honorary member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, was his chief. These personal letters are at the same time scientific, literary and political correspondence, they allow not only to get an idea of their authors, intellectuals of the Enlightenment, but also to identify close ties between the Academy of Sciences and the College of Foreign Affairs. It is known that the Academy of Sciences, consisting largely of foreigners, was closely associated with the West. Scientists from St. Petersburg were elected to many European Academies. Staehlin himself was a member of several foreign scientific communities. Members and employees of the Academy cooperated with diplomats, collected and stored information, and also did translations as well. Some scientists were even officially ranked as diplomatic personnel. In the late 1770s - early 1780s, Staehlin regularly visited Minister Nikita I. Panin and Vice-Chancellor Ivan A. Ostermann. He met Russian envoys at foreign courts and foreign diplomats accredited in St. Petersburg. These contacts allowed him to keep informed of political news. Due to his son's position, Staehlin had links, which were useful for the development of his European communication network (scientists, publishers and booksellers, antique dealers, artists, engravers, etc.). The information received from his father was also useful for Petr (Pyotr) Yakovlevich's career. As a diplomatic official, he was supposed to participate in one of the most important areas of foreign policy of the Russian court, i.e. forming a favourable image of the Russian empire, of which the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences was an integral part.

TI To the Question of the Relationship of Social Philosophy and Ideology
SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
LA Russian
DT Article
DE power; ideology; social philosophy
AB The article analyzes the connection and correlation of social philosophy and ideology. There are a large number of different, sometimes contradictory, and even mutually exclusive, definitions of ideology in the modern science. The author suggests that in order to understand this phenomenon of social life, the most promising is the functional approach. This is due to the fact that ideology is capable of realizing itself in a wide variety of forms. Moreover, it often avoids speaking on its behalf, posing as other spiritual practices (art, science, etc.), and therefore remains unnoticed, invisible social force. At the same time, in the modern world with the development and improvement of the mass communication media, it is becoming more and more "elusive". In this case, the common goal for these various manifestations of ideology will not be their form, structure or content, but the very goal that they pursue. The fundamental system-forming function of ideology is the function of legitimizing the social-economic and social-political system and/or programs for changing it. As a social philosophy as a whole, ideology cognizes and understands the surrounding reality, but does so only to the extent that it helps achieving her own political goals.

LA English
DT Article
DE Ancient Rome; republic; polis; democracy; political discourse;
   historiography; Historian Fergus G.B. Millar
AB This article studies the phenomenon of democracy as part of the discussion on the nature of the political system of the Roman Republic in the 3rd - 1st centuries BC, generated by the works of the British researcher Fergus Millar. The authors of the article believe that the key mistake of the opponents in this discussion is that they take Athenian democracy as the criterion. As a result, the researchers who refuse to consider the Roman Republic as a democracy place on it such demands that modern democratic states cannot meet. In this article, such criticisms of the Roman Republic have been analyzed and compared the current state of affairs.
   In the authors' view, direct democracy in the Roman Republic had the same achievements and the same problems with the implementation of the rights of the people as modern representative democracies. Summing up the conducted analysis, the authors come to the conclusion that as compared with the modern democratic states, the Roman Republic can in full measure be recognized as a democracy (with its natural peculiarities and distinctions). It had a full-fledged civil society that united citizens by mutual interests and goals, the sense of responsibility for the future of their homeland, conscientious performance of their duties to the homeland, and willingness to help an individual citizen. By these indicators Rome was not inferior to modern democracies. The consensus between the ruling elite and society was seen in the harmonious combination of form (recognition of the people as the source of power) and reality, in which this power was in the hands of the elite.
   Ancient Rome's experience proves that it is not direct rule of the people but stringent requirements to the ruling circles that are the foundation of a democratic system in the conditions when because of the size of a state the direct rule by the people (according to the Athenian model) is not possible. Such control, also on the part of most citizens, the search for its effective methods is highly relevant for today's representative democracy as well.

AB This review offers a detailed analysis of the monograph "A terrible tragedy. A new perspective on the war of 1812" written by the famous French historian, Professor of the Sorbonne, Marie-Pierre Rey. The author of the book declares in the introduction that she has written "a global history of the Russian campaign", claiming that historians are not particularly interested in people. It appears that the monograph is not entirely consistent with the stated global scale. Despite a careful analysis of the humanitarian aspects of the war, the book is concise with regard to military-political problems. Assessing the activities of politicians and servicemen, exploring their motives, the author almost always refers exclusively to memoir literature, and sometimes to very dubious pseudo-scholarly arguments, although there is a vast array of simultaneously published papers that give voluminous and truthful picture of the period. It is disappointing that the author who had the opportunity to work in the best archives of France practically didn't introduce new sources to scholarly circulation. Moreover, there are unfortunate inaccuracies casting doubts on the depth of the study. For example, the author confuses the number of regiments with the numbers of divisions and brigades, shows little competence in the matter of armaments, troops and their tactics. Finally, the translation of the book into Russian contains unacceptable errors in terminology, which does not do justice to the ambition of the book to blaze a trail in the historical science.

DE historiography; G. V. Vernadsky; Eurasianism; Alexander Nevsky; N. A.
   Klepinin
AB Within twenty years after the 1917 revolution, the historical memory of Alexander Nevsky had died away in the Soviet Russia due to a strong association between his veneration and the Romanov dynasty. By contrast, scholars of the emigre milieu regularly referred to the prince's historical and spiritual experience. However, even abroad, although the name of the prince occurred in fundamental works and scholarly articles, only one book on his biography was published throughout this period (1927). It is the work by N. Klepinin, whose life happened to be closely connected with the Eurasianist movement. This circumstance determined the rapprochement with the Soviet special services, participation in special operations, homecoming and, eventually, death. The dramatic fate of Klepinin should not diminish the merits of his main and, unfortunately, the only major historical work. The comparison of this work with those of G. Vernadsky and the archives of the scholar, published and introduced by A. Dvornichenko, enable us to trace the ideological connections of two emigre historians. Their contemporaries, in particular, G. Fedotov and I. Il'in, referred to the similarity of the approaches of both historians. Indeed, they had similar views on many developments and historical processes (the interpretation of Mongolian suzerainty, the role of the Orthodox Church in the national history etc). Living in the United States G. Vernadsky suggested inviting Klepinin to contribute to a large collective work on Church history. The fact that Vernadsky also sympathized with the Eurasians, although he objected to their involvement in political processes, can account for the affinity in the interpretation of historical events.

AB Processes of globalization and transnational migration, wider territorial mobility in general enrich cultural diversity of society, provides serious changes in social, political, and ethno-religious configuration of the world. Essence and consequences of changes require the understanding and predicting. European experience proves that a multicultural policy cannot provide the integration of all country residents. Fostering a national identity turned out not as successful as we hoped. Proven methods and traditional modes of explanation of changes are inefficient. Ethnic and religious diversity are the fact and the attribute of Russian history and modernity. Multi-ethnic and multi-religious population structure is a treasure and cultural resource of the country. But under the huge influx of culturally-different people, it could cause a fundamental change in social context, social tension and disintegration. In the post-Soviet period residents from Central Asia countries became the primary source of immigration. Central Asia regions in different periods of time were parts of the Russian Empire and, lately, of the USSR. Distancing from Russian culture along with renewed interest in their own history, religion, traditions, and language attach the special social and cultural nature to Central Asian migrants and call for increased mutual effort for the incorporation into the host society. There has been greater demand from governments for additional funds and mechanisms of maintaining social ties and common civic identity. We believe that, despite varying degrees of success, the return to the pre-revolutionary, heavily differential experience of ethnic and religious State regulation could be productive.

TI STAGING OF POLITICAL REALITY

LA Russian
DT Article
DE staging; symbolic politics; political reality; information space; mass
   media
AB The term 'staging', which appeared in the 1920s and 1930s as part of the theatrical vocabulary, acquired a new meaning with the advent of new media. Today, this concept reflects the invasion of dramaturgical principles, both in the everyday life of each person, and in global political processes. Using methodologies developed by the classics of political sociology and communication science (Baudrillard, Habermas, McLuhan) and modern researchers (Fischer-Lichte, Meyer, Schicha), the author shows how, as a result of the staging, the border between the real and the imagined is blurred. This can later be used for manipulating public opinion. The article discusses historical examples of the 'dramatization of reality' and its features at the present stage, and also analyzes the processes that create conditions for the popularization and widespread use of dramatization as well as its covered mechanisms. The author concludes that, amidst the growth of irrationality and uncertainty in society and the increasing role of the masses in shaping the information agenda, it is they, and not individual actors and ruling elites, who become the main 'customer' of the staged reality. At the same time, it becomes more and more difficult to neutralize the negative effects of the staging, since it has more than a single source and avoids control under current conditions.

   competence-based approach; university programmes of social work
AB In today's globalizing world international migration is on an increase, acquiring new forms and characteristics. While the scope, conditions and intensity of migration differ across the globe, migrants coming to Russia predominantly from the former republics of the USSR are a source of extra labour force and demographic growth. Thus, their adaptation to the new environment and inclusion in the receiving country's society has been growing in importance. In Russia, social support is rendered to migrants by both agencies of federal and local government and non-governmental organisations (NG0s). However, government-run agencies are authorised to provide assistance only to those immigrants who have obtained the legal status -registration or residence permit. Thus, the bulk of work with newly arrived migrants, initially getting informal or illegal employment, is performed by non-commercial, non-governmental organisations or private companies where migrants work. Expert interviews were conducted with workers of the charity foundation PSP-Fund located in St Petersburg and providing assistance to migrants and centres working with them in this city and in the North-West of Russia. The interviews demonstrated that social workers, having to deal with a whole range of diverse challenges that migrants face: linguistic, legal, cultural, health issues, often find themselves unable to effectively respond to them. Some Russian universities offer bachelor's and master's programmes preparing specialists in social work. Their syllabuses contain lists of competencies which students are supposed to develop by the end of their course of study. However, this formal approach is insufficient if we aim to prepare highly effective specialists responsive to the diverse needs and situations of migrants, adopting the view that competence should bring together 'the individual, the context, the different variations in competence, and workplace relationships' [1]. Thus, this study explored the situation and prospects of the application of the competence-based approach to learning at the workplace in the conditions of ever changing environment: political developments, financial decisions, new legal acts and the like.

AB In the article separate episodes from the life of the first female scientists - Doctors of Science in Soviet physics, professors M.A. Bolshanina, V.M. Kudryavtseva, N.A. Prilezhaeva, are highlighted Their professional development took place in Tomsk, the largest cultural center of North Asia. A brief review of the Russian-language historiography of gender studies in the history of science and education is given. At the center of the article is the problem of professional-adaptive practices of the first female scientists in conditions dominance of traditional social values. The context of the gender policy of the Soviet state and the socio-economic and political conditions, against which, in the 1920's, they received higher education in Tomsk (MA. Bolshanina, V.M. Kudryavtseva) and Leningrad (N.A. Prilezhaeva) universities, are considered. Separate episodes from their biographies, that illustrates a situation of prejudices and gender asymmetry in scientific societies of that period, are considered. It is emphasized that Bolshanina, Kudryavtseva and Prilezhaeva achieved significant success both as scientists and as organizers of science, having thus passed the path of gender resocialization and becoming, along with M.A. Levitskaya, the first women-physicists in the USSR, awarded the degree of Doctor of Sciences. Their role models in the images of a scientist, teacher and science leader are reconstructed on the materials of periodicals and memoirs of contemporaries. It is noted that in these hypostases they showed such qualities that in the gender realities of those years were perceived as "masculine". This is austerity, dedication, diligence, orderliness, "iron" principles, etc. It is emphasized that in these models the individual features of their mentors in the scientific world, first of all by Professor V.D. Kuznetsov, were reflected. A conclusion, that the practices of gender socio psychological reformatting became the main professional adaptation mechanism of the first female scientists in Soviet physics, and the main factor of their success in the science of the context dominance of traditional social values was the "masculine" gender behavioral styles in the images of a scientist, teacher and science leader, is made. Attention is drawn to the fact, that the reception of these role models as a method of a gender emancipation influenced the personal life of these women-professors, which reflected, in particular, in their rather ascetic lifestyle.

TI The System of 1955 as a unique historical phenomenon

DT Article
DE Japan; "the 1955 system"; Liberal Democratic Party; dominant party
   model; conservatism; consensus
AB The article discusses the characteristic features of the party system in Japan in 1955-1993, which give the grounds to describe its distinctive nature as a dominant party model that was unique to the global historical experience of democratic countries.
   Special attention is paid to the unique toolkit used by the Liberal Democratic Party to preserve its dominant positions in the Diet. An emphasis is put on the electoral technologies, and, first of all, on the personalistic orientation of Japanese voters, as well as on the lobbying capabilities of influential LDP MPs, which provided them with significant advantages in electoral mobilization. The personality-oriented relationship with electors allowed the LDP to recruit representatives of various social strata. The feedback mechanisms of the ruling party with the society made it possible for the LDP to effectively address increasingly complicated interests and values of individual social groups and strata by means of a consolidated state policy.
   The ruling party created a powerful political planning apparatus and maintained close ties with the bureaucracy. An important role in the system of power of the LDP was played by the mechanisms of inner-party democracy and the pluralism of opinions, ensuring a consensus within the party ranks based on the interfactional balance of power.
   The article gives several reasons for the end of the era of the "1955 system". First of all, due to the collapse of the USSR and the end of the bipolarity era, the dividing line of ideological confrontation between parties disappeared. Another reason was the fact that, by the end of the 1980s, due to the change of the model of economic development, it became impossible to finance numerous infrastructure projects in depressed regions of Japan, resulting in substantially decreased role of political authorities as the subject of redistribution of surplus social product. Electoral psychology had also changed, and the traditional methods of mobilizing votes used by the LDP had lost their effectiveness. Finally, a certain role was played by mass discontent with the ruling party, associated with the rapid expansion of political corruption, in which the entirety of the LDP leadership was involved.

DE "front of the homeland" in Germany in the First World War; children
AB The problem is, the article is particularly relevant, as in domestic science participation of Germany in the First World War was seen almost exclusively from the military and political point of view. The society of Reich had been explored fragmentary, but the German kids life remains a white stain. The article focuses on the examination of the situation and the role of the children at the "front of the homeland" during the First World War.
   The research is based on analyzing in German such scholars as: Flemming Th., Kellerhof S.-F., Meiner A., Ulrich B., Wehler H.-U. These authors had prepared their works to 100-anniversary of the First World War. Internet resources were also used, that were the materials produced by a number of academic and political and educational centers.
   The article shows that in connection with the transfer of all resources to the military industry the society situation deteriorated rapidly and children grew up in conditions of hunger, lack of fuel, lack of basic necessities. Doctors documented deterioration of children's health and increased mortality. The quality of teaching became lower due to the shortage of teachers, premises, reducing the training sessions. The most acute problem of rear during the war was hunger, from which about 700 thousand died. German children in the absence of fathers tried to help mothers in search of food, took care of younger siblings, older relatives. Many unaccompanied teenagers often committed antisocial and criminal acts that resulted in an increase in the number of convicted prisoners among them.
   During the war children were involved in the achievement of major objectives of the development of the society. With the shortage of workforce in Germany children were used in the war economy, were attracted in the campaign for the collection of recyclable materials, because there was deficit due to the British naval blockade. The Government funded the war through domestic borrowings, which involved children.
   The war had a negative impact on children of Germany. They were not aware of normal childhood, their health has been undermined, that was the threat to their future. Many war children became orphans. But after the return of the fathers the situation of many children had not changed radically for the better, as many war veterans returned home disabled, mentally depleted and could not again become heads of families.

AB The article analyzes the results of the sociological study ''The attitude of Russian students to color revolutions, political and legal measures to counter them'' (N = 1652), carried out in 2016-2017 by means of questioning the respondents at their home higher schools. The sampling frame was the quota approach to representation of students of higher schools of the Russian Federation federal districts. The study revealed the correspondence of understanding by the majority of students of the essence of color revolutions to the existing interpretations of this phenomenon in the public information space: ''technologies of coups d'etat'', ''violent change of a legitimate power'', ''foreign interference into the internal political and constitutional processes of countries''. Students underestimate the destructive impact of color revolutions on the society. The level of the protest mood depends on social conditions and unemployment. There are regional differences in the assessment of conditions that might provoke the emergence of a color revolution in modern Russia. Students of the territories, where the material well-being is lower, but the interest in politics and experience of participation in political actions is higher, estimate the risk of a color revolution in the country as more probable. Among the measures to counteract color revolutions, along with the legal mechanisms of protecting the information space, students propose that measures to combat corruption and improve living standards, taking into account the interests of the population, be strengthened.

AB Introduction. In article the analysis of estimates of the American press of the Siege of Leningrad is given. Methods and materials. The authors used the theoretical concepts developed within modern political and historical science. The paper is based on materials of both democratic and republican editions of the U.S. press. Problematic and chronological approach became the methodological basis of the research. Analysis. It is noted that the image of Leningrad passed several stages of development in the American media. Right at the beginning, the American press was more interested in Leningrad front and fights. However, very quickly the attention is reoriented on the city. The heroism of its defenders and ordinary inhabitants is emphasized that influences growth of positive perception of the Red Army. It is noted that the subject of the Siege of Leningrad developed in line with the general growth of interest in the Great Patriotic War in the American media and society. Results. The authors draw conclusions that consecration of the Siege of Leningrad by the American press positively promoted the general growth of trust of Americans to the Soviet Union. Besides, the subject of the Siege of Leningrad and in general "the fighting Russia" became an important link in work of administration of Roosevelt with media for the purpose of strengthening of the American consciousness and patriotism in wartime.

AB The article investigates the activities of the anti-Bolshevik underground in late 1917 - early 1918. After the October upheaval, various opposition groups began to form, all with the aim of organizing an uprising against the Bolsheviks and their allies. In this case, they planned to rely on spare military units of the Petrograd garrison, especially the Preobrazhensky and Semenovsky reserve regiments. In order to increase their influence on them, the conspirators sought to transfer the maximum number of their members to rank-and-file and command staff. Because of this common activity, one group headed by former general B. V. Shulgin established contact for joint actions with the former High Commissioner of the Provisional Government M. M. Filonenko, and through him with the Military Commission of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Despite a very different political orientation, which led to mutual distrust and competition for influence, they gathered forces for joint actions. The demobilization of the Petrograd garrison, opposed by the soldiers, seemed to be an opportunity for the underground. However, sudden pre-emptive actions by the new authorities in mid-March 1918 on the forcible disarmament of military units, which the conspirators planned to use, led to the disintegration of the organization and the removal of the threat of an armed uprising for the time being.

TI IN THE SHADOW OF HIMSELF: OSWALD SPENGLER AND THE HUMANITARIAN THOUGHT

DE Oswald Spengler; Philosophy of history; The "Conservative Revolution"
AB 2018 has special significance, marking the 100th anniversary since publication of the first volume of "The Decline of the West" by the German philosopher of history, cultural studies and political journalist Oswald Spengler. As time has shown, the ideas of this deliberately not academically written work, have become firmly established in the humanitarian thought of the XX century. The paradox of the perception of Spengler's intellectual heritage is that despite the fact that it was rejected by academic science, cultural, historical and political ideas of the thinker in one way or another were spread and further developed in the context of the evolution of humanitarian and sociopolitical thought past century.
   The purpose of the article is to consider the stages of reflection and perception of the Spengler's main philosophical-historical and political ideas in the Western and Russian humanitarian thought. Sources of research were the works of native and foreign humanitarians. Particular emphasis is placed on the analysis of works devoted to the study of Spengler's intellectual heritage.
   The discussion around the Spengler's ideas, mainly related to the cultural-historical concept of "The Decline of the West", began from the moment of its release. Only a few exceptions, the academic thought had rejected the idea of this book. However, even at that stage of perception and criticism of Spengler's ideas, it was obvious that he in the mythologized and polemical form had touched upon many urgent problems of our time. Return to the Spengler's works began after the World War II. Only then two trends of interpretation of his intellectual heritage emerged clearly. The first trend was characterized by the gradual adaptation of his ideas in the academic environment. The beginning of this process was laid by the German philosopher K. Jaspers. The second trend was associated with the perception of the Spengler's political ideas by "new right" movement. Ultimately, these trends have merged and gave rise to a certain extent "Spengler's Renaissance". Among the leading researchers of Spengler should be named: A. Mohler, A.M. Koktanek, E. Felken, J. Merle, J. Herf, and from Russian philosophers of "Silver Age", G.M. Tavrizyan, S.V. Artamoshina, V.V. Afanaseva.
   The perception of Spengler's intellectual heritage in the humanitarian thought of the XX century passed a long and difficult path. Elected by Spengler spiritual and intellectual path of single thinker, in humanitarian thought was transformed into an image of a thinker-mystifier and amateur intellectual who had no idea about history, culture and politics. However, the "spenglerian" evolution shows, that Spengler was able to become one of the leading representatives of German and Western humanitarian thought.

AB The article discusses the issues of syntactic-semantic solutions of fixed collocations translation. A review of collocation samples under study has been performed; and their definition has been given. The authors undertake a comparative analysis of the collocations in the process of their translation from English into Russian. The results of the functioning of the phrases studied in the Englishlanguage political mass media texts have been presented. Particular attention is paid to such word combinations that make up the periphery of phraseology. This approach is the authors development of the topic of the collocations. It is shown that the latter have not yet fully adopted their final form of use. The authors also assume that the collocations under analysis have not yet been recorded in the dictionaries. This is the core point of the authors' development. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that for the first time the presence of the related meaning of one of the components of such collocations is formulated. It is concluded that its direct and figurative meanings cannot but affect the translation solutions. The authors argue that the probability of borrowings and metaphorization among such word combinations is very high. The classification of models of formation of these constructions has been proposed. The relevance of the study can be explained by the difficulties of their rendering. The authors of the article offer their innovative approaches of translation solutions of mass media collocations under study.

   administrative judicial law; administrative procedure; judicial;
   administrative procedural law; proceedings arising from public
   relations; administrative offense
AB The subject. The paper deals with the search for the place of judicial administrative procedural law in the system of Russian law.
   The purpose of the paper is to identify is the judicial administrative procedural law an independent branch of Russian law.
   Methodology. The author uses the methods of analysis and synthesis, as well as dialectic approach. The formal-legal interpretation of the Code of Administrative Proceedings, the Code of Administrative Offences, the Commercial Procedure Code, the Civil Procedure Code of the Russian Federation and is also used.
   The main results and scope of their application. The adoption of the Code of Administrative Proceedings in Russia in 2015 revealed many problems in science and legislation. A legislative decision to adopt the Code of Administrative Proceedings is considered as a political decision taken without a proper scientific basis and contrary to established scientific doctrine. Definitions of such basic concepts as "administrative process", "administrative dispute", "administrative justice", and others have not been developed in the period up to 2015 and to date, There is a mention of "administrative legal proceedings" as one of the types, along with civil, criminal and constitutional types of legal proceedings, in the Constitution of the Russian Federation. But administrative procedural legislation is referred to the joint jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in contrast to other procedural laws, in the Constitution of the Russian Federation. Representatives of the science of civil procedural law, with reference to legal theorists, called judicial administrative procedural law (which is referred to the Code of Administrative Proceedings) the secondary formation, a sub - branch of the fundamental (profiling) branch of civil procedural law. The purpose of judicial administrative procedural law - enforcement of substantive law and conflict resolution in the field of administrative and other public relations. It is noted that the public-legal dispute is not limited to the interaction of the citizen with the executive power. Civil procedural regulation of judicial review of cases arising from public relations is a procedural mechanism of judicial protection of constitutional rights, freedoms and legitimate interests. The Code of Administrative Proceedings lowers the status of cases arising from public legal relations to the status of cases arising from administrative legal relations.
   Representatives of the science of administrative law and procedure, on the contrary, believe that the adoption of the Code of Administrative Proceedings becomes the final act in the formation of a new branch of law - administrative judicial law, although it is a political decision and it's rules are practically copied from the Civil Procedure Code. At the same time, it is recognized that the Code of Administrative Proceedings needs scientific support, which still needs to be created. An alarming factor is the fact that some scientists propose to include cases concerning imposition of administrative sanctions in the this forming branch of law, although it mixes in fact disputes between individuals and a public entity and imposition of administrative sanctions to the offender by the court.
   Conclusions. It is premature to say that judicial administrative procedural law has emerged as an independent branch of Russian law. Prospects for further development of administrative proceedings are very uncertain due to the high proportion of subjective, political factors in the legislative process.

AB There are currently six non-recognized states (NRSs) in the post-Soviet space: the Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic (PMR, 1990), the Republic of South Ossetia (RSO, 1990), the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR, 1991), the Republic of Abkhazia (RA, 1994), the Lugansk People's Republic (LPR, 2014) and the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR, 2014). All of them have been formed as a result of armed conflicts between a state vigorously pursuing the policy of national unification and a minority residing compactly. On the one hand, the legal systems of these states ensure that both the state and the civil society function effectively. In particular, each legal system forms a basis for the state's political system, sets out human rights and their guarantees and provides necessary regulation of commercial activities. On the other hand, these legal systems reflect certain "statehood deficiency" and are subject to a number of serious problems, including being dependent on political agenda as well as on certain foreign legal systems, providing no personal jurisdiction or property guarantees and having significantly underdeveloped commercial law and judicial system. This "statehood deficiency" has two main causes: the community being not ready for state building (weak statehood traditions; lack of qualified personnel, economic resources and industrial base; high level of corruption, etc.) and the state being non-recognized (including the consequences of this status such as inability to participate in international cooperation, dependence on major geopolitical players, existence of an external threat, etc.).

AB The article looks into the origin of a distinctive School of International Relations in Russia in the late 19th - early 20th c. Its emergence can be seen firstly in the rapid development of military strategy and geography in the Russian Empire; and secondly in the turbulent social and political debate about the options for the development of the Russian foreign policy in the period described. It can be assumed that the intersection of these two trends in the first half of the 20th century could create a unique Russian School of International Relations, which would occupy an important place alongside other national traditions - Anglo-Saxon, German, French, etc. However, its natural development was interrupted by the dramatic events of the beginning of the 20th century. Now, one can only guess what facets of world politics such a school could turn its attention to.

AB The subject. The article is devoted to integration of conflictology theory in legal science.
   The purpose of the paper is to confirm or disprove hypothesis that theoretical mechanisms of conflictology may be effectively applied into constitutional legal theory to prevent constitutional legal conflicts.
   The methodology of the study includes general scientific methods (analysis, synthesis, description) and sociological approach.
   The main results and scope of their application. The author describes the genesis of legal conflictology theory in different humanitarian sciences and its periodization, including integration of conflictology theory in legal science. The author substantiates necessity and justification of application of theoretical and methodological bases of science of conflictology in the constitutional and municipal law for the purpose of forecasting, identification and the resolution of the corresponding constitutional and legal conflicts.
   Conflictology of constitutional and municipal law is a research level of legal conflictology. The subject of this kind of conflictology are legal conflicts in constitutional and municipal law, their prediction, identification and resolution. It is necessary to take into account the following postulates of the General theory of conflictology in the study of legal conflicts in constitutional and municipal law:
   - the conflict is natural, objective and acts as an integral property of social life;
   - the social conflict at the same time acts as a stabilizing factor of functioning of social system;
   - social conflict is a complex social phenomenon as well as a process having structural, spatial-temporal and dynamic characteristics;
   - the organic connection of law conflict with the law. The legal conflict arises about legal phenomena, it is realized under the influence and with the application of legal norms, it is resolved on the basis of legal regulation;
   - there is a special kind of political conflict that arises within the existing government, where each of the groups within the ruling class has more private interests and its own vision of the situation.
   Conflictology of constitutional and municipal law bases on the general theoretical postulates of the science of social conflicts. Constitutional conflict is a political type of social conflict - a disagreement between the subjects of constitutional and municipal legal relations over constitutional values, which can be transformed into legally significant conflict and generate legal consequences.
   Conclusions. The object of scientific knowledge of legal conflictology in constitutional and municipal law is a constitutional and legal conflict, the study of which should be based on the above postulates of the general theory of conflictology, and can not be limited to purely legal knowledge.

   crisis of justice; ideal model; Ian Morris; Jon Elster; Paolo Prodi;
   Amartya Sen
AB One of the key features of social sciences and humanities distinguishing them from technical and natural sciences are the frequent intersections of their terminology with everyday discourse. Some social concepts have completely different interpretations in sociological discourse and everyday life, with the words "field" and "panel" as good examples. However, the majority of similar concepts of everyday life and sociological research have quite the same content. The word "justice" and its derivatives stand out in this set of terms, for hardly any other concept in human history is saturated with political connotations, or requires little additional explanation when used in social-economic debates or military conflicts. As a result, the word "justice" is widely used in all "life-worlds" (i.e., according to A. Schutz, justice seems to be both a 'first-order construct' and a 'second-order construct'), which complicates its unambiguous conceptual and empirical interpretations in sociological research. The article was supposed to be a review of two books, A History of Justice: From the Pluralism of Forums to the Modern Dualism of Conscience and Law by P. Prodi, and The Idea of Justice by A. Sen, providing a clearer conceptual definition of justice. However, it turned into reflections with some theoretical and empirical examples on why such searches in sociology are important and inevitable, but are unlikely to end with a satisfying result. This does not make such searches meaningless, but rather utopian in nature, and essential for the self-identification of the discipline through the questioning of its own conceptual foundations.

DT Article
DE Germany; the concept of "regional circles"; Bundeswehr; the regulation
   of armed conflicts
AB The article tries to conceptualize the process of creation by Germany its military-political presence in the world arena. The author explores this process based on the idea of "regional circles". The key principle of it is the step-by-step spread of influence over the nearest regions and only after it over far ones. In this regard. the example of Germany is the most interesting. During the period of "first editions" of the Cold war Germany was led by senior partners in the military-political sphere. In the 1990s Germany had been going to the role of regional power, and from the beginning of the 21st century it has been going to the role of global actor. The statues of regional power was a result of playing a role of constructor of Post-Yugoslavian political landscape and parallel keeping of strong military-political positions in Eastern European countries in the circumstances when regional states was entering NATO and the EU. During the begging of the 21st century Germany tries to create strong military-political positions in the Central Asia (since the beginning of the 2000s), Middle East (since the middle of the decade) and Sahel regions (since beginning of the 2010s). The article also explores the question of exceptions from the concept of "regional circles" in German security policy and the reasons of them. The paper also investigates the problem of zigzag character of strengthening and the loss of German military-political positions on the regional levels first of all since the middle 2010s.

AB The article explores the role of military power factor in foreign policy of German-Prussian state until the modern period. In this regard the article shows the importance of the reforms of the armed forces. Successful reforms allowed Germany to increase rapidly its military and political power and also influence on the world arena. The objects of the article are the military reforms of 1920-s - 1930-s and 1990-s - the beginning of 2020-s. Taking into account the dissimilarity between the political systems of Germany during these periods, the article notes that the military "mechanics" of both reforms have rather similar characteristics. During the first period of each reform by trials and errors method the "platform" of perspective armed forces was created. It meant that in the structure of the armed forces "exemplary" high-mobile shock military units, numerous staffs were created and an incorporation of key technical-technological achievements took place. During the second period of military reform there was the process of rebuilding of the "platform" that meant the dynamic creation of new military units of perspective armed forces. In this regard the author pays special attention to the question of usage of the restrictions that were directed to its armed forces at the begging of each military reform by Germany in its favor.

AB This paper aims to identify the features of the nation-building project of the Crimean Tatar enlightener, educator, journalist, public and political figure Ismail Gasprinskii (1851-1914) based on the analysis of his newspaper "The Perevodchik-Terjiman" (1883-1918). This Bakhchysarai-based newspaper was published for 35 years, during which time it gave a voice to the forward-thinking Russian Muslims and provided an influential platform for public debates. The completion of a comprehensive discourse analysis on the newspaper's articles on a wide range of ethnocultural and sociopolitical issues allowed us not only to examine Gasprinskii's nation-building project from the perspective of his ideas concerning the creation of a common national language, modernization of the religious sphere and inclusion of women in the nation-building process; but also to fit it into the all-Russian sociopolitical context of the turn of the 19th-20th centuries by identifying and analyzing such topics as sociopolitical conditions of Muslim Turks in Russia and Muslim emigration from Russia to the Ottoman Empire (Muhajirism).

AB Development of the Russian economy is accompanied by qualitative changes in the ethnonational sphere, what is manifested in the growth of the scales of integration processes, formation of interethnic and supranational regional civilizational communities and megaethnoses. The objective basis for these changes lies in the material and spiritual culture of peoples, but, as the practice of ethnonational relations shows, they come in a contradictory and painful way, what makes it necessary to take them into account when forming measures for state regulation of the economy. At present, Russian society needs a new scientific paradigm reflecting the positive direction of development of national relations in the country and taking into account the experience of centuries-old cooperation between nations and peoples. The article presents an analysis of the main provisions and conclusions contained in the works of Moussa Akiegetzadeh, the creator of the first major art work in the Tatar language of the last quarter of the 19th century and the founder of the system of economic views, in which the achievements of world and Russian economic science, as well as Islamic traditions were synthesized, and popularizer of these ideas in the Ottoman Empire in the era of Mesrutiat (Parliamentarism) and the following years. The thesis is Isubstantiated, according to which historical and economic knowledge acts as one of the sources for elaboration of the program documents of the Russian state in formation of regional development targets; the possibility of their realization is being determined by complete inclusion of the totality of cultural, historical, social, religious features of territorial entities.

DT Book Review
DE P.N. Savitsky; Eurasianism; Russian studies; Russia; structure; eidos
AB Russian studies are regaining popularity in social science research. However, defining this subject is more problematic than ever. The question "what is Russia?" is not a simple one and involves a whole range of philosophical, geopolitical and cultural debates and it raises further questions about the relationship between mental constructions and reality, about the natural boundaries and the ethnic composition of civilizations. Do Ukraine and Central Asia belong to Russia as a civilization? What unites the various phenomena of Russian civilization? Is Russia a civilization of Russians or of all peoples living on its territory? Russian Eurasianism offers specific answers to these questions, and the scientific aspects of the theories of Eurasians are reflected in the book under review. The book is a collection of articles by Savitsky written in the 1920s and 1930s, and includes not only pieces on Russian studies, but also on Russian history, literature and Stalinist USSR, as well as the correspondence of Savitsky with Pyotr Suvchinsky.
   Savitsky developed a doctrine of the ideal substance of Russia-Eurasia called eidos, i.e. a unity of economic, cultural and political phenomena setting the "natural boundaries" separating Russia-Eurasia from Europe and Asia. The content of Russian civilization can change (for example, in ancient times it was not so much a civilization of Slavs as of nomadic peoples), but its structural features, its ideal basis remains invariant. Later articles by Savitsky with his assessment of the Stalinist "national turn" are of particular interest. Savitsky ironizes the fact that the front pages of "Pravda" started to resemble the publications of Eurasians. He welcomes some weakening of the Euro-centrism in Soviet ideology, the recognition of the significance of classical Russian culture, but at the same time blames Stalin's leadership for a lack of creativity and a reliance on the dogmas of old Russian nationalism. Savitsky further argues that genuine creativity is impossible in an atmosphere of non-freedom and repression, which prevailed in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. Finally, the correspondence between Savitsky and Suvchinsky facilitates the understanding of the relations between members of the Eurasian movement, their theoretical fusion and disagreements, and thus completes the image of Eurasianism as an intellectual movement. The collection is preceded by a thorough introductory article by a prominent scholar of Russian Eurasianism K.B. Yermishina, who also owns the credit for compiling the book.

DT Article
DE Historical sources; Mongolia; Comintern; RGASPI; anti-religious policy;
   Buddhist church; repressions
AB The article addresses a tragic period in the history of Mongolia: the 1920-30s were characterized by repressions against the Buddhist Church that led to its destruction. The anti-religious campaign in the country was carried out by the Mongolian government and the MPRP under the control of the party and state bodies of the USSR via the Comintern. The article attempts to identify and characterize stages and methods of the fight against Buddhism, Buddhist Church and monks who threatened political and economic security of the MPR; it draws on published archival documents of the Comintern kept in the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History (RGASPI), most of which have been classified. It has been revealed that the struggle was multi-staged, gradually growing fiercer, and started with campaign aimed at destroying economic independence and welfare of the monasteries. Various methods and techniques were used, but primarily imposing of exorbitant taxes on property of lamas and monasteries, introducing a split up between lamas by dividing them into three social groups, eliminating the institute of reincarnations, limiting the number of new novices, encouraging lamas to defrock, confiscating the property of higher monks. These measures were carried out by members of the Party and the Revsomol, poor herdsmen, and lower Buddhist clergy; in result armed rebellions began in many regions of Mongolia, but were severely suppressed. These uprisings gave a formal pretext for total repressive campaign against the Buddhist clergy which ended in mass repression and complete destruction of the monasteries. Nevertheless, thanks to the surviving lamas, the Buddhist tradition continued secretly among the population, which contributed to rapid revival and restoration of the Buddhism in Mongolia, when democratic reforms began in the country.

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to reflecting the ideas of Turkish philosopher, sociologist, culture expert Ziya Gyokalp in the concepts of Kemalism, to the problem of reasonable mutual influence of the East and West, to the attempts of the first President of the Republic of Turkey Mustafa Kemal Atatyurk to introduce turkish society in the Westernized civilization in the 1920-1930s. The first Turkish president interpreted the ideas of Ziya Gyokalp, who fought for the synthesis of national traditions and European civilization achievements. The president defined such milestones in the political life of Turkey as europeanization, nationalism, laicism, etatism, revolutionism, nationality, republicanism. The article shows the struggle of westernists and traditionists; calls of nationalists to preserve national traditions, study the history of Muslim peoples and state institutions to make their adapting to new conditions of life in modernity easier. Only the balance between traditionalism and modernism can correspond to the realities of a particular society and era, while the westerners called for the transfer of European values to the national soil. Methods. The historical-typological and historical-system research methods used in the article allowed to analyze the typology and transformation of Turkish culture in the first two decades of the republic's existence. Analysis. The article shows the struggle of Westerners and Traditionalists, the appeals of nationalists to preserve national traditions, to study the history of Muslim peoples and state institutions in order to adapt them for modern life more easily, because only the relationship between traditionalism and modernism can correspond to the realities of a particular society and to the modern epoch, while Westerners wanted to bind European values and national soil. Results. The article draws the conclusion that fundamental principles of Kemalism were formulated by M.K. Atatyurk and implemented by him and his supporters not immediately, but step by step, beginning with 1918. The ideology of Kemalism is in tune with the ideas of Ziya Gyokalp to a great extent. The paper emphasizes that during the decades since the first attempts to modernize Turkey the state has taken unprecedented steps to import Western culture. Undoubtedly, transformations in Turkish society in the field of government, culture, and everyday life were of progressive importance. It contributed to national strengthening of Turkey and its transition from feudal to bourgeois forms of social life.

DE South Asia; China; India; Pakistan; regional security; geopolitics
AB The article analyzes main directions of China's policy in South Asia, examines bilateral relations of China with Pakistan and India and studies the most important directions of the PRC's foreign policy in the short term.
   The article acknowledges that modern China intends to take leading positions not only in the field of trade and economy, but also seeks to promote its political-economic initiatives, to play an active role in the "reformatting" of the world order and to become one of the global leaders in the implementation of newest technological techniques.
   In the course of the analysis, the author concludes, that currently the most serious threat to China is the proclamation by the new US administration of a policy of tough rivalry with China in the international arena, as well as Washington's actions to destabilize the situation in the Middle East and Central Asia. Washington clearly reminds Beijing of the possible blocking of China's geopolitical interests both in the South-West (Indian Ocean) and in the South-East (South China and East China seas).
   The article also notes that the United States are reinforcing their naval presence in the Pacific Ocean, strengthening cooperation in the military sphere with traditional and potential competitors of the PRC, in particular with South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and other Asia-Pacific countries. The deployment at the initiative and with the help of the US of anti-ballistic missile (ABM) and theater defense missile (Evil)) systems in the territories ofIapan, South Korea and Taiwan is considered by Beijing to he actions damaging Chinese interests in the sphere of military security.
   The article states that the basis for purposeful opposition to China by part of the West sterns from concerns of the latter associated with serious competitive opportunities and constant growth of the PRC's potential. The article also notes that main threats and challenges to the stability and security of China arise due to the existence of those significant population groups in almost all States of South and Central Asia, that adhere to ideas of separatism, Islamic extremism and use methods and tactics of terrorist struggle in the achievement of their goals.

DE subethnos; ethnographic group; ethnic (national) minority; Central and
   Eastern Europe; ethnic identity
AB The article presents the results of the study of ethno-political processes unfolding in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), with the focus on the three largest local communities that succeeded in obtaining recognition as ethnic or national minorities -Ruthenians, Kashubians and Silesians. Having considered the meaning of the term "subethnos" and its equivalents established in the CEE countries, O.Vasyukov describes the legal status of these communities and analyzes in detail the discourse they produce (aimed at securing the status of individual peoples) and strategies that are used to solve this task, emphasizing the role of the language "building".
   The study shows that the concept of subethnos/ethnographic group formed within the framework of academic science was actively involved in challenging ethnic communities' claims for recognition. The definition of such communities as subethnos should be qualified as a deliberate strategy aimed at symbolically homogenizing the ethnic picture of a country and simplifying the political process by excluding actors claiming to represent the relevant groups. However, with the collapse of the non-democratic regimes in the region, the ideal of ethnic homogeneity as the basis for the stability of the national state proved not viable. Over the past decades, the region witnessed a decent number of organizations that are fighting to improve the social and legal status of their groups. At present, the interaction between activists acting on behalf of these groups and the state authorities can be viewed as bargaining, where activists decide which strategies will help them to achieve their goals in the most optimal way, and state authorities weigh pros and cons of possible concessions that will allow them to preserve integrity and cohesion of the state-forming nations.

AB The article is devoted to the 10th anniversary of the publication of one of the fundamental works of Chinese nationalists - the book "China is dissatisfied." The author examines the extent to which the ideas of the book influenced the current mood in Chinese society and how they are reflected in the current policy of the current Chinese leadership.
   In 2006, in an article devoted to the main trends of Chinese public thought, which was published in the Russian media, one of the ideologists of the Chinese nationalists - Deputy Director Of the Institute of political science of the PRC AON Fan Ning - wrote that the most promising direction in terms of turning into a dominant ideology is of the "new left" (in the center of their ideology was the fight against corruption and inequality in society). The subsequent development of China showed that the Chinese leadership managed to integrate into the political mainstream not only the views of the "new left", but also the ideas of Chinese nationalists. And the latter gradually become the basis of China's foreign policy and initiatives of the current Chinese leadership led by Xi Jinping. This point is noted in the recently published book by one of the ideologists of the US-Chinese rapprochement Michael Pilsbury "Centenary marathon. China's secret strategy to replace America as a global superpower." Moreover, Pilsbury emphasizes that the insistence of the representatives of the Chinese establishment that the views of the nationalists are marginal and do not reflect the position of the official Chinese leadership is nothing more than a manifestation of China's stratagem behavior in the spirit of the period of "fighting kingdoms" ("zhango"), the desire to disguise the true views that lie at the heart of China's foreign policy constructions, to mislead third-party observers. The well-known formula of Deng Xiaoping, put forward in the early 1990's "keep your head down" was aimed at the same.
   It seems that the above-mentioned article by Fan Nin also pursued this goal - to convince the Russian public that the views of Chinese nationalists are marginal and do not pose a danger to the interests of the Russian Federation. Because the pathos of Chinese nationalism is directed against the United States, not against Russia. This is also quite common in Chinese political practice, designed to mislead the partner. The Chinese assessments of the current state of Russian-Chinese relations as "the best period in the history of relations between the two countries", as well as arguments about the desirability of a closer union between Russia and China, are aimed at the same.
   According to the author, underestimating the influence of Chinese nationalists on the formation of China's modern foreign policy is a serious mistake that can lead to unexpected results.

DT Article
DE Arctic; Yakutia; social history; indigenous peoples; reindeer husbandry;
   traditional economy
AB The article considers the dynamics of the lifestyle of nomads-reindeer herders of Yakutia under the influence of transformation processes that took place during the 20th century. It is shown that changes in political and socio-economic realities have changed the environment of nomadic life twice. It is noted that in the 1930-1960-ies reindeer herding in the Republic was influenced by the policy of mass collectivization of farms and transfer to settlement residence. It is indicated that the Soviet modernization of the village has become a significant challenge for the nomads: direct administrative pressure was exerted both in the socialization and in the transfer to a sedentary lifestyle. Particularly long-term preservation of nomadism in Yakutia as a way of life determined by the peculiarities of traditional reindeer husbandry in the Republic is highlighted. The authors states that the position of the official authorities in relation to the traditional economy of nomads only as to commodity sector of the agricultural sector devalued the cultural values of nomadic communities. It is emphasized that the transformation of lifestyle caused the crisis of the nomadic family, interrupted the continuity of generations in the nomadic communities, contributed to the discrimination of the culture of nomadic ethnic groups. It is indicated that the return of nomadic tribal communities in the 1990-ies was a form of ethnic self-organization of Yakutia reindeer herders.

DT Article
DE social history; everyday life; women; public organizations; indigenous
   peoples of the North; gender; Yakutia
AB The article presents a pioneer attempt to analyze the role and place of women's organizations and associations in the daily life of female residents of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The relevance of the article is due to both the presence of a historiographical lacuna on the topic and the existing public demand for coverage of regional women's history and gender history. Special attention is paid to the chronological period from the turn of 20th-21st century to the present time. As a historical excursus the subjects of 1970-1980-ies were used as an example of active involvement of the Soviet women's councils in the daily life of the Northern settlements. For a comparative analysis of changes in the women's movement, the results of historical and sociological studies conducted in Yakutia almost 20 years ago were used. The alarming stability of some factors within women's organizations is revealed, in particular, the age gap in the group of leaders that threatens the continuity of the women's movement; there is also no tangible dynamics in the estimates of the female population of their own prospects for professional and career growth. The author dwells on the preserved traditions in the activities of the Union of women's organizations as the successor of the women's councils of Yakutia, she also reveals new trends in the development of the women's movement. It is noted that with the quantitative growth of women's organizations and the expansion of the palette of their work, there are few political associations among them. The article uses the materials of the project of the Union of women's organizations of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) "Women of the North: realization of social potential."

DE Komi-Zyryan; Old Belief; mentors; religious community; religious

AB The history of the spread of Old Belief among Finno-Ugric peoples, its role in the formation of local ethno-confessional groups had drew attention of researchers for several decades. Special attention is paid to studying of the mechanisms of self-preservation of Old Believer's communities, in particular such institutions as the Old Believer community and religious leadership (nastavnichestvo). The Old Belief, which became widespread among the Komi-Zyryans at the end of the XVIIIth century, significantly influenced their culture and way of life. By the end of the XIX century three ethno-confessional groups of Komi Old Believers were formed: Udora, Upper Vychegda and Upper Pechora. Socio-political and economic transformations of the Soviet period had a strong influence on their development. The purpose of the article is to present and analyze the changes that occurred in the late 1990s - early 2000s with the most important institutions of the Old Belief: the religious community and religious leadership. The study is based on field materials collected during ethnographic expeditions in 1999-2014.
   The collected materials allow us to talk about significant changes in the socio-religious life of the Komi-Zyryan's Old-Believer communities. The author shows several variants of changes of studied religious institutions: their preservation (with a simplification of the structure); disappearance; gradual secularization (blurring of intra- and inter-confessional borders). The main problems of all Komi Old-Believer communities of this period are: small numbers, predominance of older women and the absence of youth. The author demonstrates the role of Old-Believers leaders in determining of the religious communities future fate.

ID KEY COMPETENCES
AB Sustainable development is a worldwide recognized social and political goal, discussed in both academic and political discourse and with much research on the topic related to sustainable development in higher education. Since mental models are formed more effectively at school age, we propose a new way of thinking that will help achieve this goal. The authors undertook this study in the context of Russia, where the topic of sustainable development in education has been yet poorly developed. The authors used the classical methodology of the case analysis. The analysis and interpretation of the results employed the framework of the institutional theory. Presented is the case of Ural Federal University, which has been working for several years on the creation of a device for the purification of industrial sewer water in the framework of an initiative student group. Schoolchildren recently joined the program, and such projects have been called university-to-school projects. Successful solutions for inventive tasks contribute to the formation of mental models. This case has been analyzed in terms of institutionalism, and the authors argue for the primacy of mental institutions over normative ones during sustainable society construction. This case study is the first to analyze a partnership between a Federal University and local schools regarding sustainable education and proposes a new way of thinking.

The proposals concerning the celebration the 10th anniversary of October, published in 1927 in the Soviet press, are compared with the corresponding motifs of the works of one of the greatest Russian writers Andrei Platonov, primarily with his satirical story "Proper Measures". The parodic image of Soviet ritual practice presented in Platonov's works makes possible to clarify not only the historical situation of the 1920s, but the dominating state's strategies and mass consciousness tendencies of that time.

AB The article presents how the Crimea Crisis of 2014, which heightened tensions between Russia and the West, has influenced the views of Russians on Western society and its values Basing on the analysis of the results of the sociological researches. It has been revealed that the young generation of Russians has been least affected by the current periods of a chill in relations between Russia and the West. Young people may be more likely than representatives of the elder generations to give more positive estimations of the Western countries. The exceptions are the short periods of the highest confrontation between Russia and the West during the Russian-Georgian (2008) and the Russian-Ukrainian (2014) conflicts. It is noteworthy that the Russian youth considers itself more as a part of the Western (European) cultural and historical tradition. The data of the research conducted by the author long before the events in Ukraine also showed a fairly balanced and tolerant attitude of young people toward Western civilization. Most of the post-Soviet young people are not confrontation-oriented. They consider the current complexity of interactions between Russia and Western countries to be temporary. This makes a new generation of Russians the force that can build a meaningful dialogue with the Western countries in future. Today, when there is a noticeable fatigue within the Russian society from the confrontation with the West and the peak of the political crisis has passed, this becomes particularly important.

AB The article is devoted to the evolution of the polemic of the soul between Buddhist supporters and its opponents, which were reflected in Chinese writing compositions written in the period of its distribution and expansion in China. The aim of this article is the opening of the essence of this polemic and its meaningfulness in the history of Buddhist expansion in China. In this connection, there are several tasks put forward : firstly, to analyze the religious situation that unfolded in China before Buddhist expansion; secondly, to consider the ideas about the soul, ascending to its ancient history; thirdly, to show the reasons for the evolution of the polemic concerning the soul; then, to show the polemic reflection in the compositions from the first collection of written monuments of "Hunminji," which was composed prior to the formation of Buddhist schools in China. Scientific methods such as textual critical analysis and comparative, culture logical and historical approaches are used. As a result of this article, we have obtained the the reflection of Buddhist adaptation to the Chinese religious base and its transformation in this country, rich with its own spiritual and cultural traditions. The fundamental meaningfulness and content aspects are exposed between the Buddhist opponents and its supporters, mainly, between the Confucians coming from the bureaucratic circles and well-educated Buddhists. The gradual transition of the Buddhist soteriology to the canonical course is shown in the article. In conclusion, the results of the scientific research are summarized. The polemic of the soul concluded with the appearance of the works presented by Buddhist schools formed in China. Meanwhile, the idea of the soul as the ontological basis for rebirth continues to be popular in the doctrine of Buddhism.

The United Nations indicates that the United States ranks third in the world in the number of divorces: 4.34 cases per 1,000 people, about 40 percent of first marriages and 60 percent of remarriages break up [H. F. Lewis. 9/10/2019]. Statistics in Russia is no better. In 2017, according to the Federal State Statistics Service (FSSS), there were 4.2 divorces per 1,000 people, and the first half of 2019 it was 4.0. Meantime, it should be noted that the number of marriages in Russia is falling. According to the FSSS, the number of marriages decreased from 1,049,735 in 2017 to 893,039 in 2018. [Data of the Federal State Statistics Service]. Indeed, the complex economic, political and social processes taking place in the world do not contribute to the strengthening of marriage. Modern realities require the creation of a comprehensive system to protect the interests of the most vulnerable from the negative consequences of the breakdown of a family - children, including the creation of a detailed mechanism of child support obligations. As the United States Children's Support Council (CSEC) pointed out, a growing number of parents who deliberately avoid fulfilling their responsibilities to their children has become a national problem. Today, more than 106 billion dollars for child benefits remain disbursed. [GAO Report; 2019]
   The study analyzes the laws of the United States and the Russian Federation to determine the critical points of protecting the interests of minor children during the divorce of their parents. This study is of interest not only from the theoretical point of view but also practical. Numerous marriages between the citizens of Russia and the USA and, as a consequence, many divorces require a specific synchronization of the legal and social systems for the protection of minor children.
   The purpose of this study is a comparative study of theoretical and practical problems, gaps in legal regulation, doctrinal definition, and practical implementation of child duty of supports in Russia and the United States.
   In conducting the study, the authors used a set of philosophical, general scientific, specific scientific methods of understanding of theoretical and empirical material. The implication of the dialectical materialist method allows to analyze the norms of the family, civil, and procedural law in their interconnection, interdependence, and contradiction. Using the method of comparative legal research, the authors studied the system of measures to protect the interests of children during a divorce, taking into account the need to preserve the level of well-being of children in the new conditions of interaction between parents in their upbringing and maintenance, the dynamics of changing approaches to determining the amount of child support obligations. The authors also applied general scientific (analysis, synthesis, deduction, induction, systemic) and specific scientific (historical, comparative-legal, formal-legal, technically legal, social modeling of research) methods of cognition which allowed to ensure a comprehensive study of existing methods in maintaining the wellbeing of minors.

AB The review of the materials of the international conference (september 23-24, 2019) on the role of the Renaissance Italian historiography in the development of the modern historical science. The conference was timed to the jubilee dates connected with the writings of two great historians and political thinkers of the Renaissance - Niccolo Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini, as well as the publication of the translation into Russian of "History of Italy" written by Guicciardini. Both Florentines created profound and original historical writings that have kept their significance and been republished on different languages to present day. At the conference there were discussed issues of the transition from medieval to renaissance paradigms at different regions of Europe, especially in Italy, the development of historiography from local to national, political ideas of Machiavelli and Guicciardini in their historical interpretation, some aspects of literary works, and political philosophy of Niccolo Machiavelli.

AB In this article, we study the political and legal model currently used by Norway in its Northern counties. This work is a part of comprehensive research supported by the Russian Science Foundation. Our study aims to provide a historical perspective to the model of Norway's national ethnic policy in the Northern counties by identifying the operational capabilities and assessing the efficiency of these models amid increasing migration flows and changes in the country's socio-economic environment. The methods we use in this multidisciplinary study are situated at the interface of national and international law, political science, history, and sociology. They include the comparative historical method (the dynamics of ethno-political processes), the systemic method (ethic policy in the framework of target-based programme management), the comparative law method (a comparison of national legal systems and international contractual standards), the value and norm-driven method (ethnic policy viewed through the prism of public good), institutional method (the role of political institutions), and the secondary analysis of sociological data. We also rely on qualitative methods, namely, the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data on ethnic diasporas living in the North of Norway. As a result, we establish that the Kingdom of Norway has a unified approach to national ethnic policy, which rests on self-confessed multiculturalism. However, different ethnic political models are applied in the case of certain ethnic groups. Today, against the background of declared state multiculturalism and integration, the models of acculturation and non-violent assimilation are both operational in Norway. There are sporadic expressions of nationalism and voluntary segregation. We conclude that, despite a unified approach to ethnic policy and despite Norway's political and legal achievements in the protection of indigenous peoples' rights, the country's government carries out a differentiated 'hybrid' ethnic policy towards ethnic groups living on its territory. The growing infighting between the right and the left parties in the Storting translates into unpopular and spur-of-the-moment political decisions as regards inter-ethnic relations.

The author explores the civil expectations in Czech Republic from joining the European Union, on the one hand, and political realities following the elections to the lower house of the Czech parliament - the Chamber of Deputies in 2017 and to the European Parliament in 2019 - on another. Special attention is paid to the evolution of a position of the movement ANO 2011. It is specially noted that caution is a determining feature of foreign policy expectations of electorate not only in the Czech Republic, but also in other countries of the Visegrad Group. The 15-year history of relations between the Czech Republic and the EU is interesting not only in itself It is a detector of the degree of "entry into Europe" in almost all countries of the region.

AB 2018 saw a resumption of inter-Korean dialog becoming unprecedented in intensity and including 3 highest level meetings. The declarations signed by the two leaders in April and September had special clauses devoted to economic cooperation projects which each side places their hopes in. The article analyzes directions and possibilities of implementing inter-Korean economic cooperation in the current situation and its prospects under the influence of internal and external factors.
   In 2018 North and South Korea agreed to promote economic cooperation in a number of areas, such as the connection and modernization of railways and highways on the eastern and western coasts of the peninsula, ecology, forestry, health care, as well as the resumption of the Kaeson industrial complex and the Kumgansan tourist project (if the necessary conditions were created). Despite some progress in the inter-Korean economic dialog, there are serious obstacles for developing economic relations between North and South at the current stage. They include strict economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council and the USA against the DPRK, as well as unilateral sanctions of the ROK declared on 24 May 2010. After the next presidential elections in South Korea the political will of a new government will be one more variable defining future of inter-Korean economic relations.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE jihad; Islam; liminality; re-Islamization; Arab Spring
AB This article discusses evolution of the interpretations of jihad from the angle of two worldview platforms represented in the system of views of intellectuals in the Islamic world - minimalist and maximalist. These platforms differ in their perception of social reality, as well as concepts of truth and justice, which are basic for Islam. Minimalism in general allows critical attitude to the surrounding reality, even in Islamic states, as well as local interpretation of the concepts of truth and justice. Maximalism endorses critical attitude towards reality only in the states where Islamic laws do not apply, and only if approved by the highest religious authorities. Maximalism interprets concepts of truth and justice as universal. In accordance with Islamic moral and ethical norms, both platforms have the right to exist, and the choice between them is an individual matter of every Muslim. As a result, the Islamic communities witness stratification not only of the elite, but also of the Ummah, which is divided into a "systemic" opposition that is ready for a dialogue with the government, and a "non-systemic" opposition that a priori excludes the possibility of a dialogue with the government.
   According to the authors, the events of the Arab Spring were caused by the spread of the elite's split into the entire Ummah, which created the basis for intra-Islamic tension, which, in its turn, pushed a poorly organized mass of believers into the streets of Arab cities. The authors describe the current stage in the development of the Islamic community as a period of liminality i.e., a structural crisis associated with political and social instability, a change in group and individual forms of self-identification and sharp cognitive dissonance among ordinary believers, coupled with an increasing trend towards re-Islamization in countries of non-canonical Islam.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE poetology; lyricology; literary reflection; Russian poetry; Russian
   poets; poetic activity; lyrical genres
AB The beginning of the 21st century is associated with the feeling of exhaustion of different ways inherited from the tradition of imagining the range of meanings associated with poetry as a special phenomenon of culture. The purpose of this article is to identify a system of similarities and differences in the interpretation of the poet and poetry in modern poets such as A. Skidan and M. Stepanova. The analytical techniques used in the work are reduced to the identification of author's poetic concepts, the characteristic of associated semantic contexts, and a comparative typological analysis of the solutions offered by the of information exchange in culture, with the increasing role of the media, with the change in the principles of interaction between the poet and his audience. The actualization of relation to the transcendent, archaic sacrifice and waste rituals is the way to resist the world devaluation. Going beyond the limits of the coordinate system, which is universal for the modern culture, is carried out with the help of "poetics of disruption" and "poetics of refusal", by emphasizing "negativity" and "opacity" in the poetic speech. Genre polymorphism, collage composition, stylistic polyphony, poetic polyphony, destruction of the image integrity, subjectivity destruction are means of its creation. Modern "poetry without properties" involves the creation of"text-ruins", which meaning arises at the moment of its destruction. This poetry involves a high degree of reflection, attention to various ways of creating aesthetic conventionality. Within the framework of poetic concepts of A. Skidan and M. Stepanova, the novelty effect is associated with the exit into "someone's" space, with the intentional "interruption of aesthetic illusion'. At the same time, the "end" of poetry or its "death" is considered as an extreme case, which in modern artistic practice is replaced by the questioning of the usual signs of poetry. The reflexivity of"poetry without properties" does not exclude attention to the irrational mechanisms of creativity uncontrollable to the subject. In case of studied poetic concepts, they correlate with the concept of "literary machines" capable of producing meanings beyond the control of the subject and even in spite of him. The ultimate goal of the "negativity" of modern lyricism is to create a new sociality and a new political understanding.

DE state; society; reforms; modernization; systemic crisis; Peter the
   Great; history of Russia
AB The publication presents the authors' interpretation of the origins, character and crisis potential of Peter the Great's reforms in the context of the formation of Russia as a European power and Empire. Interest in such theme is caused by the fact that over the past two centuries, these reforms have been interpreted very ambiguously by domestic and foreign researchers: the range of opinions contains both unambiguously positive and unambiguously negative assessments of Peter's activities. The authors pay special attention to the historical, political and social context and prerequisites of Peter's transformations. The article substantiates the approach according to which by the end of the XVII century Russian society was experiencing a systemic crisis that affected not only the institutions of state power and management (archaic Boyar Duma and clumsy system of prikazy), but also the economy, education, science, religion, military affairs and, as an inevitable consequence foreign policy and the prestige of the country. No less important aspects, from the point of view of the purpose of the study, is the attempt made by the authors of the article to substantiate the reasons and the factor that led to the inconsistency and conflict potential of Peter's modernization, carried out in the conditions of catching up (mobilization) type of development of Russian society.

AB The study contributes to the ongoing scientific discussion on the issue of the residence of Buryats in Northern Manchuria in the 17th - first third of the 18th centuries. The novelty of the study is that, based on the analysis of the names of the Buryats, Bargu-Buryat and some other ethnic terms, an updated history of the Mongol-speaking ethnic groups of northeast China at the indicated time is presented. It is established that the word Buryat (from Mong. Buraa 'forrest') is the archetype of the ethnonym Buryat. It was the name of a tribal association, located west of Lake Baikal in the middle of the XVI-XVII centuries, on the basis of which, with the coverage of Transbaikalia, by the end of the XVIII century a Buryat nation was formed. It has been proved that the Buryat community was given the byname Bargu-Buryat living south of the Mongolian steppes. It was especially emphasized that at the beginning of the 20th century in the local history literature on the population of the right bank of the Argun the byname Bargu-Buryat was transferred to the two ethnic communities of the old Barguts and new Barguts that lived in the region, who did not participate in meso-ethnogenesis, and therefore never called themselves Buryats. It was found that the researchers were misled by the word Bargu(t) in the names. There was a distorted opinion that has a definite effect on modern authors, that the Buryats during the period of the Manchu rulers from Nurhatsi to Yongzheng were residents of Northeast China.

AB Public statements of U.S. and the Russian Federation presidents for the purpose of fixing time modes in them - past, present and future are investigated in the article. Lingvo-temporal analysis as the diagnosis of time ciphered in the text, gives new opportunities for research discourse. Based on the narrative analysis of texts, authors find specifics of representating specific modes in J. Bush, B. Obama, D. Thrump, V.V. Putin and D.A. Medvedev's performances. The conclusion is drawn about existence of common positions in temporal content of inauguration speeches of the American and Russian political leaders, universal models of reflecting on the present, future and past. Specifics of the presentation of time are following: semantic associations, quotations, use of images of heroes and the broad ideological priorities. Features of the images of time presentation by leaders of the USA express interest in a mythologization of the past, the idea of dialectics of a providentsialism and man-made creation of the past, communication of the future with universal and global prospect, metaphoricalness, figurativeness, symbolical character and active use of the past-hints performing function of supporting semantic frameworks, background function of representating the present. In speeches of the Russian heads of state there are: a distance from the recent past (overcoming in the present of recent years problems), a positive image of the present, strengthening of democratization of the political rhetoric appealing to national tradition and "the ordinary person".

TI Soviet Researchers on the Middle East: Ahead of Their Time
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian

   revolutionary democrats; non-capitalist way of development; conflicts
AB In the mid-1950s-1960s the Soviet Orientalists were facing serious challenges. The collapse of the colonial system, the growth of national liberation movements, the entry of new forces that did not fit into the rigid framework of the Communist ideas about the revolutionary process, demanded realistic explanations of what was happening. The article attempts to consider some breakthrough ideas and assessments of historical events in the Middle East put forward by the Soviet experts. The review is primarily based on the publications of Soviet specialists published in the 1970's. Among those who studied the new trends and tried to explain their further development were Soviet Arabists. At that time their circle was small. Among those who were engaged in political problems of the Arab world, one can name I. P. Belyaev, E.M. Primakov, G.I. Mirsky, A.M. Vasilyev. They had different backgrounds, but all had managed to form in their studies a fairly complete picture of political trends and state-building in the Arab world. Despite the domination of the official dogmas the leading Soviet researchers were able to present a realistic picture of the region, although their "untimely meditations" were presented in a form acceptable to the Communist ideology. The primitive division of society into the bourgeoisie, the proletariat, peasantry and landlords and the hopes for eventual development of communist parties worldwide both did not reflect the realities in the Third World countries and did not leave room for the Soviet Union there. Due to ideological reasons the USSR could not support nationalist movements abroad. Nevertheless, the Soviet leadership passed the first test for the ability to reassess their ideological stereotypes in the early 1950s, when the leaders of the Egyptian revolution turned to the USSR for military assistance. In order to justify the pragmatic choice in favor of supporting the new Arab nationalist leaders, the Soviet scholars developed the concept of three consecutive and co-dependent revolutionary flows: first, the national liberation movement overthrowing the colonial system; second, the world labor movement overthrowing the capitalist system politically; and, third, the world communist movement overthrowing the capitalist system in economic terms.
   It was also important for the Soviet leaders to explain the orientation of the young decolonized nationalist regimes towards the USSR, without using the argument of just political expediency. Such an explanation was the theory of the non-capitalist path of development or socialist orientation. It posed that capitalism cannot solve any of the problems of developing countries. Their interest in rapid overcoming of backwardness and maintaining national sovereignty cannot be combined with the choice of a capitalist development model. The theory of socialist orientation was based on original ideas of Marxism founders and further developed by Lenin who insisted that economically underdeveloped countries can with the help of the proletariat from advanced countries go directly to socialism bypassing capitalism.
   The reality of revolutions without the proletariat and the desire to take advantage of the anti-colonial struggle to establish full-scale presence of the USSR in the Middle Eats made the Soviet leadership more tolerant of scientists' attempts to realistically analyze regional trends and developments.
   For instance, in the Soviet era, politicians were tempted to explain all conflicts in the regions of the Third world, and particularly in the Middle East exclusively by the workings of imperialism. However, Soviet scholars, E.M. Primakov among them, warned in their studies of the dangers of such simplified estimates. Still relevant today also is G. Mirsky's explanation of the major role the army plays in the politics of the Middle East. He argued that in the traditional societies of the region the army was the only modern, nationwide institution.
   The works of the Soviet scholars can help better understand contemporary trends. Their studies of driving forces of the revolutions in the Arab world, of the nationalistic regimes, of regional conflicts have not lost their relevance today. They warn the modern generation of researchers against simplistic conclusions, a temptation of politicized assessments and of ignoring the complexity of regional issues.
