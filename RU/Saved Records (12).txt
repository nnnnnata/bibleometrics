AB The last decade has witnessed growing interest among political scientists and economists in nondemocratic politics. This trend has been reflected in increasingly rigorous game-theoretic modeling of its various aspects: regime persistence and breakdown, ruling-coalition formation and leadership change, protests and repression, formal institutions and elections, and censorship and media control. We review this research agenda, focusing on the foundational assumptions and political intuition behind key models. Our survey reveals a field populated by disparate models of particular mechanisms that nonetheless share two major analytical themes: asymmetries of information and commitment problems. We propose that future models move toward a genuinely comparative study of authoritarian institutions.

AB There is a rich body of theorizing on the diffusion of democracy across space and time. There is also an emerging scholarship on authoritarian diffusion. The dynamics of the interaction between external democratic and autocratic diffusion processes and their effects on national and sub-national political regime outcomes have received scant attention in the literature. Do democratic diffusion processes help counter external authoritarian influences? And, in contexts where external diffusion of democratic influences is weak, do we observe greater susceptibility to diffusion from regional autocracies that might in turn reinforce authoritarian practices and institutions in recipient states? To address these questions, we perform analysis of data from two original under-utilized data setsa data set on the European Union (EU) aid to Russia's regions and a data set with statistics on trade among post-Soviet states. We find that EU aid has the effect of countering external authoritarian influences that work through Soviet-era inter-regional economic ties.

AB Since the collapse of Communism, Russia and some other post-Soviet states have attempted to pursue socioeconomic reforms while relying upon the political institutions of neopatrimonialism. This politico-economic order was established to serve the interests of ruling groups and establish the major features of states, political regimes, and market economies. It provided numerous negative incentives for governing the economy and the state due to the unconstrained rent-seeking behavior of major actors. Policy reform programs revealed these institutions to be incompatible with the priorities of modernization, and efforts to resolve these contradictions through a number of partial and compromise solutions often worsened the situation vis-a-vis preservation of the status quo. The ruling groups lack incentives for institutional changes, which could undermine their political and economic dominance, and are caught in a vicious circle: reforms often result in minor returns or cause unintended and undesired consequences. What are the possible domestic and international incentives to reject the political institutions of neopatrimonialism in post-Soviet states and replace them with inclusive economic and political ones?

AB Why do authoritarian regimes permit elections in some settings but not in others? Focusing on the decision to hold subnational elections, we argue that autocrats can use local elections to assuage powerful subnational elites. When subnational elites control significant political resources, such as local political machines, leaders may need to co-opt them to govern cost-effectively. Elections are an effective tool of co-optation because they provide elites with autonomy and the opportunity to cultivate their own power bases. We test this argument by analyzing variation in the decision to hold mayoral elections in Russia's 207 largest cities between 2001 and 2012. Our findings suggest that Russian mayoral elections were more likely to be retained in cities where elected mayors sat atop strong political machines. Our findings also illustrate how subnational elections may actually serve to perpetuate authoritarianism by helping to ensure elite loyalty and putting the resources of powerful elites to work for the regime.

AB The concept of the Russian world (Russkii mir) re-entered geopolitical discourse after the end of the Soviet Union. Though it has long historical roots, the practical definition and geopolitical framing of the term has been debated and refined in Russian political and cultural circles during the years of the Putin presidency. Having both linguistic-cultural and geopolitical meanings, the concept of the Russian world remains controversial, and outside Russia it is often associated with Russian foreign policy actions. Examination of official texts from Vladimir Putin and articles from three Russian newspapers indicate complicated and multifaceted views of the significance and usage of the Russkii mir concept. Surveys in December 2014 in five sites on the fringes of Russia - in southeastern Ukraine, Crimea, and three Russian-supported de facto states (Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria) show significant differences between the Ukrainian sample points and the other locations about whether respondents believe that they live in the Russian world. In Ukraine, nationality (Russian vs. Ukrainian) is aligned with the answers, while overall, attitudes toward Russian foreign policy, level of trust in the Russian president, trust of Vladimir Putin, and liking Russians are positively related to beliefs about living in the Russian world. In Ukraine, the negative reactions to geopolitical speech acts and suspicions about Russian government actions overlap with and confuse historical linguistic-cultural linkages with Russia, but in the other settings, close security and economic ties reinforce a sense of being in the Russian "world."

AB We derive a simple rule for a nearly optimal carbon tax that can be implemented and tested in a decentralized market economy. Our simple rule depends on the effect of the pure rate of time preference, growth, and intergenerational inequality aversion and basic parameters of the carbon cycle, but also on any adverse effects of global warming on economic growth and mean reversion in climate damages. The performance of the simple rule is excellent and yields only negligible welfare losses compared with the true welfare optimum under a wide range of perturbations including some extreme runs designed to severely road test the rule. Our IAM allows for scarce fossil fuel and endogenous energy transitions and generates cumulative carbon emissions and stranded assets which are also well predicted by our rule.

AB Voters commonly face a choice between competent candidates and those with policy preferences similar to their own. This article explores how electoral rules, such as district magnitude, mediate this trade-off and affect the composition of representative bodies and the quality of policy outcomes. We show formally that anticipation of bargaining over policy causes voters in elections with multiple single-member districts to prefer candidates with polarized policy positions over more competent candidates. Results from a unique field experiment in Afghanistan are consistent with these predictions. Specifically, representatives selected by elections with a single multi-member district are better educated and exhibit less extreme policy preferences.

ID ELECTORAL SYSTEMS; DECENTRALIZATION; COMPETITION; NUMBER; DEVOLUTION
AB This article uses a representative sample of elections held in 80 countries (1992-2012) for a statistical analysis of societal and institutional factors of party system nationalization. The analysis demonstrates that high degrees of political decentralization, such as in federations and devolved states, exert a strong negative effect on party system nationalization. However, in the long-term federalism can accommodate highly nationalized party systems. Another factor that strongly contributes to party system nationalization is a high quality of democracy. The degrees to which different varieties of electoral rules support party system nationalization are associated with a lack of incentives for cultivating the personal vote. Countries with large populations and societies divided along linguistic and/or religious lines tend to have party systems that are less nationalized, but these factors are not as important as institutional determinants. The impact of some of the factors is mitigated by party system fragmentation.

AB This article contributes to current discussions on state capacity, quality of institutions, and political regimes. Our analysis demonstrates that the J-curve argument ("good institutions" in autocracies as compared to hybrid and transitional regimes) may not be generic and is not well supported by empirical evidence from the sample of post-Soviet countries. An explanatory model of the "King of the Mountain" is instead provided. Its focus is on the monopoly of political rent as a precondition for extraction of economic rent. It demonstrates an inverse correlation between the quality of institutions and the extraction of political and economic rent, and explains why an autocrat may not have an incentive to improve institutions that may make his/her monopoly vulnerable, and rather would prefer to preserve a low quality of institutions and "bad enough governance." An analysis of a variety of external and domestic factors that may endanger this monopoly is provided. Finally, the autocrat's alternative strategic choices are analyzed. It is argued that better payoffs for the autocrat - paradoxically - may result from partial reforms and improvement of the quality of institutions. However, for various reasons, this is not occurring in post-Soviet autocracies.

AB Diversionary war theory holds that insecure leaders are more likely to pursue aggressive foreign policies than their more secure counterparts. This hypothesis rests on the premise that interstate dispute involvement helps leaders deter potential challenges against their rule. We offer strong support for this premise by looking at coup attempts. Cross-national time-series evidence from interstate dispute participation over the period 1960-2000 indicates that a country in a militarized confrontation with another state is about 60% less likely to experience a coup attempt in the subsequent year. Consistent with our hypothesis, we establish that it is mainly militarized involvement in disputes, rather than non-militarized involvement, that is associated with lower coup likelihood. The results are robust to controlling for a wide set of potential correlates of coups and remain qualitatively intact when we focus entirely on within-country variations in coup attempts and interstate disputes.

AB Identity politics are a key sphere of public policy. The paper focuses on the changes in the politics of identity pursued by the contemporary nation-state, its agenda and its possibilities, limits and risks. The transformations in the mechanisms of civic identity formation on the nation-state level are conditioned by a wave of "new nationalism" in countries with a strong civic tradition and a relatively high level of social welfare. Federalization, decentralization and devolution currently under way in Europe reflect the ethnic dimension of contemporary politics promoting language, religious, economic or cultural issues. Nation-building trajectories tend to vary as they fail to comply with the "universal" nation-state model, and the essence of the nation itself is questioned in the changing social environment. Today a key priority of identity politics pursued by the state is managing diversity in multicultural and, more often than not - divided societies. A comparative study of three cases of interethnic tensions regulation in European countries with ethnic minorities enjoying a different political, economic and cultural status indicates that the contemporary model of civic consensus supported by the nation-state is undergoing a deep transformation. These changes are due to the formation of new multilevel political spaces and to the growing demand for regulating interethnic conflict in a world of rapidly increasing migration inflows and reaffirming ethnic identities. Welfare, cultural policies and political and economic levels of autonomy (devolution) are key spheres of contention in countries with sustainable democratic political institutions. Alongside with the innovative development of territories, including those where minority groups are present, effective instruments for lowering the level of interethnic tension appear to be, as this study indicates, a common view of development priorities shared by the territorial (local) community and a positive alignment of civic and ethnic identities in day-to-day communications. "Active citizenship" constitutes an important part of civic identity. The consolidating basis of the modern nation, the foundation of civic concord is public commitment to the development of the national community.

AB Why do some political parties join popular protests, whereas others abstain or even oppose them? Using a paired case-study comparison between the Russian regions, we examine political parties' strategies towards the "For Fair Elections" movement in 2011-2012 and explain these choices through two jointly operating mechanisms: level of party institutionalisation; and co-optation. We show that despite the symbiosis of the state and political parties and overall parties' loyalty to the regime, they differ in strategy and degree of involvement in social movements on an organisational level. We argue that the mechanism of party institutionalisation explains the switch between involvement and abstention, while co-optation does a better job in explaining the "support/counteract" choice.

AB This study empirically evaluates the scope of formal gubernatorial powers in Russia, compares the current state of affairs with the situation registered in 2002, and explains the outcomes and the dynamics of institutional development in the regions by means of statistical analysis. The analysis demonstrates that during the period under observation, the scope of gubernatorial powers increased as a result, to a significant extent, of the federal center's strategy, which combined centralization with the cooptation of subnational elites. Several intra-regional factors, including electoral systems, the political composition of regional legislative assemblies, and the overall balance of power on the assembly floor, resisted this trend.

TI Factors Associated with Breastfeeding Initiation: A Comparison between

DT Article
ID MOTHER-CHILD COHORT; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; DURATION
AB Background
   Breastfeeding is associated with multiple domains of health for both mothers and children. Nevertheless, breastfeeding initiation is low within certain developed countries. Furthermore, comparative studies of initiation rates using harmonised data across multiple regions is scarce.
   Objective
   The aim of the present study was to investigate and compare individual-level determinants of breastfeeding initiation using two French-speaking cohorts.
   Methods
   Participants included similar to 3,900 mothers enrolled in two cohort studies in Canada and France. Interviews, questionnaires, and medical records were utilised to collect information on maternal, family, and medical factors associated with breastfeeding initiation.
   Results
   Rates of breastfeeding initiation were similar across cohorts, slightly above 70%. Women in both Canada and France who had higher levels of maternal education, were born outside of their respective countries and who did not smoke during pregnancy were more likely to initiate breastfeeding with the cohort infant. Notably, cohort effects of maternal education at the university level were found, whereby having 'some university' was not statistically significant for mothers in France. Further, younger mothers in Canada, who delivered by caesarean section and who had previous children, had reduced odds of breastfeeding initiation. These results were not found for mothers in France.
   Conclusions and Implications for Practice
   While some similar determinants were observed, programming efforts to increase breastfeeding initiation should be tailored to the characteristics of specific geographical regions which may be heavily impacted by the social, cultural and political climate of the region, in addition to individual and family level factors.

AB Given limited resources and economic realities, how do politicians distribute monetary transfers in order to retain office? Previous work has largely focused on two models - a core model of rewarding loyal supporters and a swing model of purchasing the support of easily swayed voters. Empirical results have proven mixed, however. In this article, we argue that these mixed results are due to economic factors, which condition politicians' distributive strategies. In our model, we consider that politician and voters are involved in a repeated game, where past expectations condition future strategy. Current (core) supporters who receive few benefits and perceive themselves worse off than other, less loyal, groups are likely to be less loyal themselves tomorrow. In our model, politicians avoid this by providing their supporters consumption benefits directly, in the form of transfers, or indirectly, via strong economic growth. Where economic growth is good, politicians can distribute less to core supporters, who benefit from the rising economy. Where economic growth is weak, however, politicians make transfers to their core supporters to ensure future loyalty. We test our theory using data on federal transfers from the Russian Federal government to 78 Russian Regions from 2000-2008.

AB This study uses a nearly comprehensive set of the world's electoral democracies and authoritarian regimes, comprising 185 country-level observations, in order to examine the effects of electoral institutions upon party system nationalisation. Party system nationalisation is defined as the achievement of substantial electoral support for major political parties on a national basis. I hypothesise that while largely inconsequential from the perspective of alternation in power, authoritarian electoral institutions are highly consequential in that they affect party system properties in consistent, theoretically predictable ways. The empirical test confirms this hypothesis by demonstrating that in democracies and authoritarian regimes, the effects of electoral systems on party system nationalisation are similar in strength and direction. These findings imply that conventional electoral engineering can be used to enable the survival of modern autocracies.

ID INCOME; CONFLICT; VIOLENCE; TASTE; WAR
AB The study suggests that the relationship between per capita GDP and intensity of antigovernment demonstrations is not negative as tends to be believed; we are rather dealing with an inverted U-shaped relationship: the highest levels of antigovernment demonstration intensity are typical for countries with neither the lowest nor the highest values of GDP per capita, but rather with intermediate values of this indicator. Thus, for higher values of per capita GDP we observe a negative correlation between GDP per capita and the antigovernment demonstration intensity, and for lower values it is positive. This correlation is partly explained by the following points: (1) GDP growth in authoritarian regimes leads to increased pro-democracy movement, and hence to intensifi cation of the anti-government demonstrations. And since in our database (as well as in reality) authoritarian states constitute a very high percentage of the number of states with the lowest values of per capita income, the effect of the growth of internal pressure on authoritarian regimes towards democracy with economic growth to some extent (but no not completely) explains a strong correlation between GDP per capita and the intensity of antigovernment demonstrations for low and middle income countries. (2) In the range of per capita GDP up to $20000, the increase in per capita GDP is quite strongly correlated with a decrease in the proportion of authoritarian regimes and the increasing share of non-authoritarian regimes (democratic and intermediate). The presence of non-authoritarian regimes in this range is significantly positively correlated with the higher intensity of anti-government demonstrations. This is another mechanism that contributes to the presence of a strong positive correlation between GDP per capita and the intensity of anti-government demonstrations in the range of interest to us. At the same time we have done a further analysis that has shown that both of the above mechanisms do not explain the correlation in question to the full, which means the need to find additional mechanisms and factors.

DT Article
DE trust; sociological operationalization; conceptualization;
   institutionally-lexical context; corpus linguistics
AB Sociology poses the problem of quantitative interpretation of qualitative research. The article deals with institutional and lexical context method based on corpus linguistics considered as one of the solution tools. Based on "Grounded theory" methodology (Strauss A., Corbin J.) and partly conceptual analysis (Sartory G., Goertz G.), we propose to start the definition of the concept with quantitative research. The authors identified useful areas of corpus linguistics in analysis of social management phenomenon and distinguish between methods of corpus linguistics and sociological content analysis: direct appeal to everyday use of the language increases objectivity of the research; a corpus provides large representative data; possibility of diachronic and synchronic comparative studies; the method itself is not time consuming and expensive. We chose the concept "trust" to demonstrate the cooperation possibilities between corpus linguistics and sociological research methodology. The data for the study comes from Russian National Corpus (Russian). As a result of research we conclude that concept "trust" is used in the context of political institution and that the personal features are less important than formal status. Moreover, we have found new contexts, for example, a "telephone of trust" (telephone hotline), which is used to report crimes.

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE museum science; museum; study of Siberia; G.N. Potanin
AB Scientific heritage of G.N. Potanin includes museology works, and, we believe, they require a special study. Potanin's interest in museums grew on the basis of his interest in the investigation of nature and the historical past. Preparation of herbaria, reading N.M. Karamzin's works, dealing with P.P. Semenov-Tyan-Shansky, and then the big expeditions through China and Mongolia led him to the museum science. G.N. Potanin understood that museums preserve commemorative subjects of nature and history, give an opportunity to study and popularize them. Potanin sent his expedition materials to many museums in Siberia: in Irkutsk, Omsk, Tomsk, Kyakhta and Minusinsk. Some results of his collections are still preserved in these museums. As a staff member of the Irkutsk museum, he developed programs of museum material collecting, participated in the preparation and publication of catalogs. He organized an exhibition of Buddhist culture subjects, first in the history of the Irkutsk museum. The exhibition had a great success among visitors. As a fellow-curator in the Museum of Applied Knowledge at the Charity Society for Elementary Education in Tomsk, Potanin managed to obtain funding from the Tomsk City Council and renewed the museum's equipment and collections. Thanks to G.N. Potanin, the Tomsk museum opened its doors to visitors and worked for about three years. The Museum of Applied Knowledge stopped its work in 1906 because the authorities banned the activities of the Charity Society for Elementary Education. Nevertheless, G.N. Potanin worked on describing a collection of Buddhist culture in the Archaeological Museum of the Imperial Tomsk University. However, in 1910, his work was forbidden for political reasons. G.N. Potanin was involved in the establishment of the Siberian Science and Art Museum in Tomsk in 1911. He participated in the planning of museum construction, arranging for the collection and storage of museum objects. Still, the provincial authorities dismissed him from the Museum. G.N. Potanin did not lose interest in the museum science until the last months of his life. He thought about giving his private collections to public custody. As a matter of fact, his scientific heritage was scattered over Siberian museums and libraries. Now it is time to clarify the structure and placing of Potanin's collections. Inventory of his museum heritage can provide new knowledge about Siberian museums and museums of Russia in whole. It will show Potanin's contribution to Siberian culture on a large scale.

   Bureaucracy: the Content and the Outcomes
SO MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE public sector reform; higher education; education services;
   quasi-markets; new public management; institutional projects; political
   and bureaucratic markets
AB This article shows that the outcomes of the higher education reforms in Russia were not only determined by design, but by the unintentional quality of the institutional project as a whole in which the interests of different stakeholders had to be harmonized.
   The conceptual framework of the reform relied on the recent approaches in public administration and management, which basically mimic the approaches in the private sector that foster efficiency. These approaches were explicitly neoliberal in nature and involved the creation of quasi-market conditions in public sector institutions. It is shown, however, that the negative effects of applying these new approaches to higher education in Russia were far stronger than in most other countries. This is explained by the specifics of the institutional reform developed by the expert community and officials at the Ministry of Education and Science and the peculiarities of its implementation. By analysing regulatory documents and data from surveys of Russian university lecturers the implicit and explicit goals of the reform are revealed, as are the changes in internal institutional relationships, socioeconomic standing of lecturers and other stakeholders, and the motives that shaped the reform as a whole.
   It is shown that the violation of the partnership principle in designing higher education reform in Russia was due to the specific political and bureaucratic context which has developed in Russia. Agency relationships in the system of public sector management (i.e. interactions between voters, policymakers, administrators and public institutions) were replaced by subordination relationships (from politicized bureaucrats to universities as producers of educational services and lecturers as the 'cogs' of this production). As a result, rather than being immersed in the quasi-market structures inspired by the reform's design, the system of higher education was put under tight bureaucratic control. The bureaucrats were put in charge of setting the goals for higher education institutions and monitoring their performance and achievements, whereas universities and university lecturers had only a passive role in the reform process. In reality, however, the new rules were rejected within universities, and the existing academic structures began to erode leaving space for the further individualization of academic activities and increased university managerialism.

DT Article
DE national minorities; multicultural education; Tatar language; Tatarstan
   republic; Russian Federation
AB This article explores the development of language and education policies in the Republic of Tatarstan, a constituent of the Russian Federation, in the context of continued decline in minorities' political nationalism between 2000 and the 2010s. The new "model of Tatarstan" relies on a close partnership with Moscow reaffirmed by an exclusive treaty on the division of powers. However, this formality does not eliminate Tatars' cultural contention for recognition and autonomy. The case of Tatarstan speaks to both the potential and the constraints of autonomous territories that are incapable of satisfying the needs of co-nationals living beyond their administrative borders. Language policies and education practices have become a relatively autonomous area for claim-making in defense of Tatar culture as well as bilingualism and multicultural education in the region. This study reveals the interrelationship between the two components, Tatar ethno-culturalism and "pluri-culturalism," and the encouragement of the region's diversity in the public domain of Tatarstan. Valuable in itself, the latter in a wider context appears to be a necessary condition for protecting minority groups in multinational Russia. Thus while promoting the interests of the "titular" nationality - ethnic Tatars - Tatarstan also serves the advancement of multicultural values in present-day Russia.

DT Article
DE identity policy; identity politics; macro political (national) identity;
   memory politics; symbolic politics; official historical narrative;
   collective memory; myth; usable past; governing elite
AB The article explores a particular aspect of the identity policy of the Russian state - an evolution of the official historical narrative describing a genealogy of the nation. It is highly important for legitimization of the political regime as an "explanation" of continuity between collective past, present and future. The research is based on the theoretical frame that conceptualizes a historical component of identity politics and reveals factors that influence its structure in the contemporary Russian context. The author argues that there were two large periods in the development of the official narrative based on different conceptions - that of "the new Russia" and of "the thousand-years-long Russia". These periods roughly coincide with presidency of Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin - Drain Medvedev. The construction of the new narrative maintaining the Russian identity was complicated by a necessity to match two principally different cultural models of political work at the past - that of "coping with a difficult past / collective trauma" and aimed at consolidation of the nation / nation-building. There were different approaches to this political task in different periods. In the 1990s the official narrative had integrated discourse about "trauma and crime" as a part of legitimization of the post-Soviet transformation, but it could not manage to consolidate the nation. In the 2000s the choice was made for apologetic principle of work with collective past which resulted in the eclectic construction that marginalizes the topic of "trauma and crime". In the 2010s we can see some attempts to make the official narrative more consistent which bring ambivalent results. On the one hand, in the context of the current international conflict the apologetic conception of the national past is securitized as a "weapon" against the foreign and domestic enemies. On the other hand, a new round of discussions about the national history opens some windows of opportunities for actors struggling for "coping with difficult past" agenda.

ID MILITOCRACY; BUSINESS
AB The article presents the results of a study of channels of recruitment and career paths of members of the administrative elite of the Russian Federation, conducted in 2013-2014. Federal administrative elite was understood as a set of persons occupying key positions in the structures of Russian presidential and executive power. The source of empirical data is a biographical database which contains information about 575 senior administrators, including the president and key officials of his administration; government members, deputy ministers, heads of federal services and agencies and their deputies, as well as principal officials of government apparatus. The analysis led to a number of major conclusions. First, with all the variety of career paths, the dominant trends are internal recruitment and professionalization of high officials: administrative structures, primarily federal, are the main source of elite cadres. Second, the militarization of the administrative elite is essential, but outside the force structures themselves it is not the prevailing trend of recruitment, being more pronounced in the presidential administration than among governmental and ministerial elite. Third, the management of economic structures is a significant, but usually indirect source of recruitment of elite administrators, and plutocratization is most typical for the ministries responsible for the regulation of the branches of the economy. Although some administrators are from the economic elite of the federal level, in general, to judge by the composition of the higher officialdom, inter-factional elite mobility is not high. Finally, the federal Parliament (and in general, representative bodies of various levels) plays a secondary role as a supplier of not only administrative elite in general, but even members of the government, which in many advanced capitalist democracies have traditionally been recruited from the deputies. Relatively weak incidence of parliamentary careers among the government elite reflects the specificity of the political system of modern Russia, characterized by weakness of parliamentary institutions.

AB A business enterprise interested in influencing the design, adoption or enforcement of a particular law, rule or regulation often confronts a choice. Does it lobby officials directly? Or does it do so indirectly, using a collective action group as an intermediary? We draw on data from a large, 2010 survey of enterprises across the Russian Federation to demonstrate that the propensity to engage in intermediated lobbying increases with region-level political competition. Our explanation builds on recent evidence confirming Mancur Olson's claim (1982) that less encompassing actors tend to lobby for more distortionary policies. We hypothesize that with greater political competition government officials become more responsive to encompassing voices (i.e. associations of businesses as opposed to single firms), since the electoral costs of being captured by narrower interests becomes greater. Evidence from a complementary survey of regional business association managers points in the same direction; the relative attention paid by officials to lobbying efforts by encompassing associations increases with political competition.

ID GEOPHYSICS
AB International geoscientific unions (geounions) have been coordinating and promoting international efforts in Earth and space sciences since the beginning of the 20th century. Thousands of scientists from many nations and specific scientific disciplines have developed ways of cooperation through international unions and learned how to work together to promote basic geosciences. The unions have been initiating, developing, and implementing international cooperative programmes, setting scientific standards, developing research tools, educating and building capacity, and contributing to science for policy. This paper analyses the role of geounions in and their added value to the promotion of geoscience internationally in the arena of the existing and emerging professional societies of geoscientists. The history of the geounions and the development of international cooperation in geosciences are reviewed in the paper in the context of scientific and political changes over the last century. History is considered here to be a key element in understanding and shaping the future of geounions. Scientific and organisational aspects of their activities, including cooperation with international and intergovernmental institutions, are analysed using the example of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG). The geounions' activities are compared to those of professional societies. Future development of scientific unions and their role in the changing global landscape of geosciences are discussed.

AB Over the past couple of years, our knowledge about diffusion processes has increased greatly. So far, the focus has been on public policies, political institutions, and civil society repertories. Our paper breaks new ground by exploring value diffusion at the societal level. Using the World Values Survey data, we are interested in the diffusion of emancipative values in different regime types, building a bridge between research on the micro foundations and macro political expressions of democratization and political regimes. In particular, we wish to understand whether the psychological bedrock of a pro-democratic mass culture - emancipative values - is diffusing between countries and, if yes, to what extent this diffusion is limited to democracies or also makes inroads into autocratically governed societies.

   frontier; network frontier; network public policy
AB In the article, the authors have integrated the network approach and the Frontier Theory, proving the heuristic potential of such a synthesis in discovering of the network society flexible borders development logic. The conceptual ideas of the Frontier Theory were revealed by the American historian F.J. Turner and his followers, later this approach was borrowed and adopted in other branches of social sciences and humanities. The authors disclose the potential of this theory with regard to the social space, including the network space. In this research, the network frontier is defined as a mobile space border of contact and mutual interpenetration between the network society social/cultural practices and those of previous times. The main stages of its development are justified and described according to several criteria. These are availability and variety of interfaces; specific technological platforms that create conditions for the networks and communities formation; centering of frontier zones around the "gravitational fields" (which are different network leaders and innovative practices in the network structures); the role of a state in implementation of control, regulatory and coordinating functions in the public network space. The researchers have identified and discussed some of the network frontier markers, such as the mobility of network border, specific features of governing system, "abuse of administrative power" and arbitrariness. The frontier demonstrates numerous examples of transgressions, first of all, in the identities formation. The directions of future research are outlined in the article: the network frontier myths and heroes, the evolution of the frontier type of personality in different social spaces, and other. Modern political processes, the growth of the developmental non-linearity and uncertainty actualize the frontier discourse in political studies.

DE Wellbeing; modern society
AB The topic of the well-being of human and society has always interested the great thinkers of the humankind. However, conceptually, as a problem of the state and public, this topic fully emerged only in the aftermath of the Second World War in the past century, and it became especially topical in the mid-60s, when a special organization was founded on the basis of the United Nations Organization, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP, 1965). Well-being became a popular topic for various socio-political, socio-economic, cultural, and historical theoretical research and applied programmes. However, there is no unanimously agreed definition of this category or a unanimously agreed approach to its research and evaluation of its value and importance to the human and the society. The present article continues a cycle of the author's articles devoted to the research of human well-being in nowadays conditions. It looks into the basic concepts, conceptual grounds, and contradictions shaping the key aspects of this broad topic, as well as the fundamental causes and possible methodological misconceptions influencing both their development and the attitude to them of a human, society, state. The article provides extensive statistical data which illustrate the enormous, egregious ill-being of a large part of human society in the modern world. Also, in the article we have undertaken an attempt to define well-being as a multiple-aspect concept and presented a detailed analysis of fundamental causes of the modern ill-being on a massive scale.

AB The objective of this paper is to analyze the scope for improving the empirical and methodological foundation of global value chains (GVCs) research and for making relevant political decisions, primarily through applying Foresight methodology. The authors review the major trends of global value chains' development, specific features of Russia's participation in them, and the necessary steps to increase the quality and efficiency of this participation, in particular in the changing geopolitical context. Special attention was paid to the theoretical, methodological, and empirical aspects of GVC research which are far from adequate (we primarily mean international databases such as TiVA and WIOD developed with the participation of the OECD and the WTO): they need to be supplemented with advanced tools to improve their forecasting potential, as well as their practical and strategic orientation. To this end, approaches which would make it possible to research the interconnections between global processes and trends with regional and national innovation-based development tendencies become of crucial importance. The application of Foresight methodology may significantly contribute to researching the GVC phenomenon, being a major logical step towards creating advanced research and policy tools to mobilise available resources and coordinate stakeholders' actions to increase global competitiveness. The paper presents several case studies which describe the practical application of Foresight methodology to analyze Russian participation in various GVCs, giving examples of specific product and service groups. The authors conclude that both full-scale Foresight studies and specific components thereof could be applied for the purposes of GVC analysis, strategic planning, and political decision making.

AB The evolution of the Afroeurasian world-system which in the 'long 16th century' was transformed into the global World System comprised both economic and political components, some of which are discussed in the present article. Earlier research has identified four major zones of instability which can be designated as the Central Asian (including Afghanistan and Pakistan), the Middle East, North Africa, and the Sahel region. We suggest considering these four zones as a single Afrasian macrozone of instability. We show that this zone correlates rather closely with the zone of traditional prevalence of the parallel cousin marriage, as well as with the zone of very low female labor force participation rate, and the territory of the Umayyad Califate. The article demonstrates that this correlation is not coincidental and also discusses the factors and mechanisms that have produced it.

AB This paper challenges the central claim of Natalia Forrat's article that university support programs under Putin targeted the suppression of anti-regime student mobilization. Empirical evidence, both on the national-policy level and on the level of higher education institutions, suggests that the government introduced support programs in order to establish a research capacity at Russian flagship universities and to develop a more competitive national science system. The low level of students' political engagement can rather be attributed to the outdated structures of student representation, inherited from the Soviet period.

AB This article investigates the complex relationship between federalism and electoral authoritarianism by making an empirical inquiry into the structure of incentives that shaped the reform of Russia's regional election laws in 2004-2009. The idea behind the reform was to make the incumbent governors more manageable and more dependent on the federal authorities. However, the process of its practical implementation largely coincided with Russia's transition to electoral authoritarianism, as a result of which this original intention was reversed by endowing regional authorities with an unrestricted effective power to determine the course of the reform. The main hypothesis of this study is that bounded only by the reform framework, the governors exerted their influence to maximize one of their main assets, the loyalty of the regional assembles. In order to substantiate this hypothesis empirically, a model formalizing the governors' optimization problem is constructed, its possible implications are discussed and their statistical support is examined. The results obtained support the theory according to which electoral authoritarianism, rather than simply suppressing the autonomy of most powerful subnational actors, incorporates them by expanding their effective control over the regional political arenas. The previously existing federal arrangements are instrumental in pursuing this goal.

TI THE BALTIC SEA REGION AND INCREASING INTERNATIONAL TENSION

DE Baltic Sea Region; Russia; European Union; NATO; regional cooperation
AB For many years, the Baltic Sea region stood out for its remarkable stability. The dramatic changes following the end of the Cold War did not have a profound effect on the territory. However, Russia's cooperation with other states in the Baltic Sea region began to lose momentum. This paper discusses the negative effects of the Ukrainian and Syrian crises and the increasing tension between Russia and other countries in the Baltic Sea region. In the short term, these trends are unlikely to reverse. Of the two possible scenarios - suspending relations until a solution to the political and military problems is found or trying to make use of every opportunity in economy, culture, science, education, etc., - the latter is preferable. A breakdown in regional cooperation will weaken Russia's position. However, gaining positive momentum may prove instrumental in overcoming the confrontation between Russia and the West in the future.

AB The authors assess the theoretical and methodological problems arising in the definition and in the study of ethnic conflicts in the contemporary transforming world order, and give their definition of ethnic (ethnopolitical) conflict with a focus on the political mobilization of ethnic identity. Building on a qualitative analysis of 27 cases of ethnic contention in different countries and regions of the world chosen by expert evaluation, they elaborate an analytical model for studying ethnic conflict using a factor-based approach. The key factors that drive ethnic contention are detected, considered and compared: these include collective memory and claims for language and cultural autonomy, religious and confessional differences, economic and social disparities, clan and tribal interests overruling the common interest, as well as external influence and the political accommodation of ethnic interests. The comparative study brings to light, as the article arguments, three types of ethnic conflict: territorial, institutional and policy-oriented. Three cases are presented to illustrate these findings, with special attention to contention in the post-Soviet political space. The study brings forward arguments to support middle range theory: it can be adapted to evaluate ethnic conflict as a driver of political change in the contemporary world, whereas "grand theory" has in this case considerable limitations which are due both to the complex nature of these conflicts and of the transformations of the world order, and to the highly contested contemporary theoretical discourse on conflict and ethnicity. This does not, however, overrule prospects for further steps towards elaborating a broad theoretical framework for conflict assessment and regulation. The authors see the transformation of identity conflicts into conflicts of interests and the formation of appropriate institutions for their reconciliation as an effective instrument for incorporating ethnic identities into the identity politics agenda on the national level. Depoliticizing ethnicity is a marker of effective conflict regulation and prevention. This can be achieved by promoting public policies in the social sphere, with special attention to education, and by a positive convergence of civic and ethnic identities over a national "accord on development". To achieve a positive outcome, it has to be sustained by thriving community activities in various spheres where different identities meet.

AB The paper reveals essence and contents of the life world notion in terms of sociology of life. Life world is analyzed as a combination of core meanings of life, taking into account the underlying fundamentals of human existence. Data of the national survey in 2014 and the all-Union research of public consciousness in the late 1980s permitted to explore trends in the development of the life world, its meanings, defining the major life goals that are of highest value to humans. Its main meanings are characterized especially in the activities of the contemporary Russians as economic, social, political and spiritually-cultural persons. On this basis the meanings of sustainable value orientations, ideological principles that people are guided by and which they exercise in their relationships with society and the state are analyzed. It is shown that in reality there are diverse life worlds, filled with different semantic content.

AB The article is devoted to the establishing of permanent gendarme supervision on private gold mines in Siberia in 1841-1842. This subject has not been yet studied in historiography. The article reconstructs main stages of the formation of gendarmerie units in Siberia in the 1830s, as well as basic legislative acts which regulated the system of police surveillance in the mines. The article touches upon main discussions in government circles on how to enhance policing in the gold mines in the spread of various forms of social protest. Special attention is paid to the duties of gendarme officers in the mines which were set out in special secret instructions. Almost all Siberian mines were privately owned production. Exiles made up the bulk of workers in the private gold mines of Siberia in 1830-1840-ies. The authors conclude that the situation in the Siberian gold mines, the accumulation of large masses of exiles and first labor unrest drew the attention of the political police before the establishment of a permanent supervision of gendarmerie. Thus, already in the 1830s it became clear that special measures to maintain order in the gold mines in Siberia were needed. Strengthening of police activities should be also linked with the widespread of illegal mining and sale of gold. In this regard it is not surprising that the post of the gendarmerie officer in the gold mines of Eastern Siberia was set against the opinion of the East Siberian governor-general. The initiator of the establishing of a gendarmerie officer post to oversee the Siberian gold mines was the governor-general of Western Siberia P.D. Gorchakov. He was supported by the chief of gendarmes A.Kh.Benckendorff. On the 9th of May 1841 the post of gendarmerie officer in the goldfields of Western Siberia was established. In May 1842 a special secret instructions for this officer was prepared at the headquarters of the Corps of gendarmes. It assumed that the gendarme would not be vested with police powers, but watch the execution of the "Regulations on private gold mimes" of 1838. Gendarme staff officer in the mines of Eastern Siberia received additional police powers. The establishment of the gendarmerie control in the mines was prepared by the logic of the organizational development of the Russian political police and gendarmerie in general, the tendency to expand the scope of the gendarmerie and, more broadly, government control. Gendarmerie officers acted in the role of government agents and gendarmes surveillance system was conceived to ensure a high credibility in solving conflicts, their independence from the gold miners and higher administration of Siberia.

AB This article is devoted to the study of the phenomenon of political perception in Russia which the researchers of the Department of Political Sociology and Psychology, Faculty of Political Science, Lomonosov Moscow State University have been carrying out for more than 15 years. Authors focus on images of politicians, authorities and political parties formed in the mass consciousness of Russian citizens. Analysis of the empirical data of 2013-2014s, as well as of previous years revealed some trends and patterns in political perception in the new political context that emerged during the third presidential term of Vladimir Putin. Results of the study confirm that the mass consciousness in Russia, though complex and multidimensional, is becoming increasingly homogeneous. The events of 2014 opened the window for a long-needed public consensus on national values that has replaced the fragmented mosaics of the 2000s. Economic problems and aggravation of the global situation don't destabilize the country, but lead to social consolidation and a return to traditional values of Russian political culture such as justice and patriotism. People also think that for successful development of the country Russian authorities should create a strong state that will be able to determine its own path, including the form of democratic system. Our study also showed a tendency of growing need for security (the need for stability and order) among citizens.

ID ANTI-CORRUPTION; CIVIL-SOCIETY; IMPACT; TIME
AB Do radical anticorruption measures such as lustration reduce corruption by systematically limiting the political participation of former authoritarian actors? While research has largely overlooked the role of transitional justice in addressing corruption, some scholars claim that lustration may increase corruption by reducing bureaucratic expertise. Analyzing original panel data from 30 post-communist states from 1996 to 2011, we find that lustration is effective in lowering corruption. Lustration disrupts the political, economic, and administrative malpractice of the preceding regimes by limiting opportunities for corruption of former communist elites. To illuminate the causal mechanism, we examine the cases of Estonia, which has adopted lustration and lowered corruption; Georgia, which has reduced corruption since first considering lustration; and Russia, which has not adopted lustration and maintains high levels of corruption. This study breaks new ground with a novel system-level explanation and an integrative approach to causation for the entire post-communist world.

ID RIGHTS
AB At the peak of the anti-religious campaigns under Nikita Khrushchev, communist propaganda depicted women believers as either naive dupes, tricked by the clergy, or as depraved fanatics; the Protestant sektantka (female sectarian) was a particularly prominent folk-devil. In fact, as this article shows, women's position within Protestant communities was far more complex than either of these mythical figures would have one believe. The authors explore four important, but contested, female roles: women as leaders of worship, particularly in remote congregations where female believers vastly outnumbered their male counterparts; women as unofficial prophetesses, primarily within Pentecostal groups; women as mothers, replenishing congregations through high birth rates and commitment to their children's religious upbringing; and women as political actors in the defence of religious rights. Using a wide range of sources, which include reports written by state officials, articles in the church journal, letters from church members to their ecclesiastical leaders in Moscow, samizdat texts, and oral history accounts, the authors probe women's relationship with authority, in terms of both the authority of the (male) ministry within the church, and the authority of the Soviet state.

AB The paper aims at revealing factors influencing the development of e-government in the Russian regions. Based mainly on the innovation diffusion concept we run quantitative analysis, testing the significance of political, technological, socio-economic and administrative variables. Our study shows that the diffusion of e-government itself was to a large extent the result of a vertical influence of the federal government, however, disproportions of e-government performance can better be explained by internal characteristics of the regions. We argue that the key predictors for a more mature e-government are relatively democratic political regime, technological advancement, bureaucracy effectiveness and investment in ICT. The explanatory model could best be expanded by case studies focused on agency rather than the structure.

AB The history of the Chinese Eastern Railway goes back for more than 100 years. Today we must objectively assess its historical significance and its place in the history of sociocultural relations between the peoples of Russia and China. Recently, in both Chinese and Russian science we can see the withdrawing from the study of the political history of relations between Russia and China in late 19 - early 20 centuries in favor of the study of the history of cultural interaction between the two nations. No matter how modern Chinese and Russian scientist evaluate the role of CER in the history of Sino-Russian relations, the majority of them agree that the railway itself together with the city of Harbin represent a unique sociocultural phenomenon. Historians of St. Petersburg University in cooperation with Chinese colleagues from Harbin Institute of Technology are working on the following aspects: the role of the Chinese Eastern Railway in creation of the image of China in Russia, the Railway status after the Russo-Japanese war, economic policy on the Chinese Eastern Railway line, the Chinese labor migration in Russia during the First World war, engineering and construction solutions.

LA Russian
DT Article

   Belt, One Road" concept
AB In this article, the most significant factors of 2015 - early 2016 are identified and analyzed, which define new trends in the political and economic development of China. Firstly, it is the domestic political situation evolvement, including military reform and new ideological answers of Xi Jinping to the criticism against his course on the part of the Conservative party elite. Secondly, - the economic results of the past year, indicating the continued slowdown, and the new strategy for the Chinese economy development. Thirdly, it is the change in the demographic situation in China after the end of the "one-child policy". And fourthly, - the continuation of a new China's foreign policy formation, active in content, with a focus on the European Union, Eastern Europe, the SCO, the Middle East and Africa. In conclusion, the main challenges that China will face in 2016 are identified. The primary challenge is the strengthening of opposition to Xi's anti-corruption campaign amongst the part of the Party and military elite, which have suffered from this campaign. In response, Xi Jinping will go for reinforcement of the party discipline and for establishment of strict control over intra- and, especially, non-systemic dissidents. Another challenge is the entry of China's economy into a new stage of development, characterized by increased uncertainty. The consequence of this will be Beijing's greater need for new control mechanisms that the government is not quite ready for. One more challenge is the transition to a new active foreign policy toward the "Silk Road", in regional conflicts, particularly in the Middle East, and proactive participation in global governance. In that sphere, the main problem will be lack of preparedness among the Chinese foreign policy authorities (in terms of conceptual and practical politics) to work in the spirit of "activity" and promotion of constructive, understandable ideas acceptable to world leaders. The consequence of such "lack of preparedness" could be a slowdown in development and implementation of the Chinese leaders' foreign policy initiatives. China is still not fully ready for the world leader role.

ID VAGUENESS
AB The paper deals with following issues. In his seminal work "Concept of Law" H.L.A. Hart famously claimed that both the law and legal language are open-textured. It is known that Hart borrowed the term "open texture" from his Oxford colleague Friedrich Waismann, whom he duly acknowledged as the inspiration for the conclusion that law as well as language is open-textured, but it is worth noting how the term changed meaning in the borrowing. According to Hart, legal concepts are not necessarily endowed with some uncertain meaning: indeed, it is not even possible to fully establish the meaning of some legal terms. In analyzing the operation of legal rules, H.L.A. Hart purported to adopt Friedrich Waismann's idea of "open texture" and adapt it to law. 1) Hart claimed that rules necessarily possess "a fringe of vagueness or 'open texture'", and he attributed the idea to Waismann. But it is not obvious that Hart and Waismann were talking about the same thing. Is the open texture of law more than the open texture of its language? 2) One problem is that Hart's language is ambiguous as between the view that vagueness and open texture are distinct, as Waismann argued, and the view that "open texture" is for Hart simply a synonym for "vagueness". But is Hart's claim correct? 3) Hart argued that language is consistently open-textured, but is there an open-texture of law distinct from, or at least going beyond, the open texture of the language in which legal rules are written? Hart seemed to believe so, but it is not at all clear that Hart was right in so believing. I will try to answer the main question for the purposes of my research project " Is the legal language or the language in which legal rules are written open-textured?" I will carefully consider main arguments against or for this question. I will attempt to argue that for Hart's theory of legal language the connection between "open texture" and vagueness is necessarily.

AB The article presents the General Fractal Model of Transit (GFMT) designed to apply modeling in the sociopolitical disciplines. For the purposes of conducting computer experiments with the model, a Modernofractal 5.1 program was created. Constructing procedures for algebraic fractals enables to simulate social evolutions in the phase space, mainly their starting and end points. The GFMT formula iteration simulated interaction of a series of abstract governing factors, which may be treated as the most significant for different social systems under the stage of transformation. The GFMT has the potential tuned, made more specific, for studying various social phenomena. The authors examined the heuristic opportunities of this analysis tool as applied to the fields of historical and political science research (the object of study was rapid modernization of institutions with informal game rules). The article contains descriptions of several GFMT computer experiments demonstrating the analysis tools and interpretability of outcome data.

AB The concept of social capital is gaining certain stability in the social studies. The heuristic potential of the concept is confirmed by numerous studies which prove the positive impact of levels and types of social capital on a wide range of social phenomena. Approaches to theoretical justification of social capital empirical appraisal are being formed, which is particularly relevant amid of general economic and structural crisis. However, science still lacks a generally accepted definition of social capital and the agreement on the ways to measure it. The article aims to theoretically justify the building of an indicator model for empirical measurement of social capital, which implies a set of indicators generated for a particular conceptual framework and helping obtain organized information about the phenomenon under study in order to identify the correlation between its components. The article is intended to foreground the need for social capital empirical measurement and comparison. The article contains analysis of theoretical approaches to the definition of social capital, notes its multi-aspect nature and productive ideas about the triadic nature of social capital lying at the interface between sociology, political science and economics. On the basis of generalization of positions concerning the types of social capital presented in scientific literature, the authors make a conclusion about the fundamental importance of distinguishing bridging and bonding social capital; of the necessity to identify special indicators for these types of social capital and their formal and informal components. The article presents the authors' approach to building a social capital indicator model, including cognitive (readiness to join, responsibility for the state of affairs) and structural elements (degree of participation in public activity, degree of participation in political activity, ability to influence the state of affairs), which helps obtain a set of generalized and systematized components and measurements of social capital of a region structured by both institutional form (formal-informal) and location. The authors emphasize their position regarding the relevance of regional aspects of social capital.

AB The text dedicated to the 60th anniversary of Russian Political Science Association is devoted to the genesis, mission and role of this organization in the context of political development of the past decades and current trends in the evolution of modern politics. The key threats the modern political science is facing are divided into two main sets. The first one includes relations of political science and political practice, or how global and local challenges shape the modern social knowledge. The second set includes development issues of the discipline: correlation of the world science mainstream with the agenda and configuration of Russian political science; dichotomy of the foundations of political science - theoretic, conceptual and imperatively pluralistic; conjugation of fundamental and applied areas and their thematic content; comparative analysis of the effectiveness of research strategies and methods; the relevance of the applied performance evaluation system of scientific activity in political science. The importance of political science today is determined, in the author's opinion, by the fact that the dominant feature of the current era (post-modern in its essence) has become the compound symbiosis of politics and economics. Ideas, ideals, interests and technologies of their conjugation constitute the subject of political science. In terms of the second law of thermodynamics, political science is an institutional tool against irreversible dissipation of social energy. The complexity of political science in this case is that is operates with patterns of probability character, most of which are applicable only in a short time perspective. This, in the author's opinion, determines the need for constant self-reflection of the discipline, which does represent the mission of RPSA and its social function - to create the formats and provide for stability of professional communication. The author examines the formats and technologies of implementation of RPSA's social function as a significant civil society institution which continues to form its identity in the context of qualitative increase in complexity of social changes and domination of nonlinear processes.

The collapse of the Soviet empire in 1991 has not led to the restoration of the Empire in a new guise; the result was a bifurcation of the paths of nation building. This is, on the one hand, the way of the former imperial metropole, and on the other hand - divergent political practices of the former Soviet republics, who have fallen away from the metropole. Particular attention is paid to the fact that almost all post-Soviet states (including Russia) were de facto formed on the basis of multi-ethnic communities existing at the time of the Soviet collapse. Formal inter-republic borders of a unified Union inherited by the post-Soviet states have become a factor which considerably complicates implementation of the tasks of nation-building. This legacy activates all sorts of separatist movements and stimulates the emergence of territorially detached internationally unrecognized political regimes and "frozen conflicts". The former imperial metropolis went through the building of a new "vertical of power" and disciplining the elite in the institutional framework of a personalistic regime. At the same time, it has become a point of attraction for all the separatist political forces of post-Soviet space which were unsatisfied with the conditions of existence in the new "ethnic democracies". The article analyzes the post-Soviet phenomenon of "special separatism" which rejects ethnic nationalism and xenophobia and sets the goal to merge with another state - Russia, rather than building an independent national state. The Ukrainian case (after its political turn in 2014) demonstrates an alternative scenario. The motivation for this turn is pragmatic, and resources of ethnic and national consolidation and politicization of ethnicity along with the instrumental imitation of ethnic conflict in Ukraine are used to promote political interests. This represents a potential threat for the future of Ukranian statehood.

AB In today's Russia the ethics of virtue becomes more widespread and it supplants Kantian ethics of principles in public discourse. The article argues that this transformation of political morality in Russia is determined ontologically by fragmentation of social structure that is based on citizenship and citizens' morality. To eliminate social conflict the groups are not compares in one and the same moral and legal space, so particular citizens become unequal without sufficient moral grounds within a nation-state. Thus estates particular morals start to become more autonomous.

AB This paper develops the previous publication of the author ("Polis. Political Studies". No. 6. 2015. P. 157-172) where he presented a theory of transformation of political regimes, analyzed the concepts of political regime, political relations, political cooperation, routine and conflict strategies, described the conditions of regimes' crises and the nature of neopatrimonialism. Here the author's attention is focused on the structural typology of neopatrimonial regimes which is built on the basis of different relations between the regime's core (the patronage network) and the periphery (groups and individuals outside of the network). Thus partial democracy, harsh authoritarianism and totalitarianism are distinguished, each with its own specifics of neopatrimonial relations. The diversity of neopatrimonial regimes in Africa, Latin America and post-Soviet space is considered in these terms. The factors of stability and turbulence, the reasons for choosing a particular vector of regime's transformation are analyzed. The post-Soviet regimes changes are considered in three dimensions: democracy - authoritarianism - totalitarianism, the level of bureaucratization, and stability - turbulence - crisis. The known factors of state breakdowns and regime transformations are refined for neopatrimonialism,

AB Germany (the basis of its national economy remains the industrial sector) is on the verge of the Fourth industrial revolution. It involves the integration of Cyber Physical Systems in factory processes by connecting the machines, tools, warehouses Internet, among which will have independent data exchange. They will initiate certain actions and control each other independently. In order to prepare economic agents for such a revolution, in 2011 the concept "Industry 4.0" was worked out. Since 2014 it has been implemented in practice, primarily in the engineering industry, automotive industry, transport and logistics sector. The state actively supports this initiative as part of the digitization of the economy and is involved in its implementation, along with big business, small and medium-sized companies. At the same time it uses it to enhance the attractiveness and competitiveness of the German economic and political space.
   One important part of the German 'Standort' policy is the development of international cooperation in the framework of "Industry 4.0", together with the United States, France, Japan (in the context of similar national initiatives).
   The article analyzes the content of the concept, the role of various actors in its implementation, the effectiveness of undertaken measures, especially in 2015-2016. The chances of "Industry 4.0" as a guarantor of the world leadership of Germany in the industrial sector are considered.

   Treaty Organization; regional organizations; conflicts; conflict
   resolution; preventive diplomacy; use of force principles; mediation
AB The article describes and debates main points and recommendations of the Report-2015 of the Independent High Level Group on the UN Peace Operations. The author analyses doctrinal innovations and practical guidelines suggested by the Group and debates consequences of the recommended "politicizing" of the UN operations (assuring the leading role for the UN in any political peace process supported by UN peacekeepers, and avoiding operations where the UN role is limited to passive disengagement of conflict sides). Necessity for and limits of reconsidering traditional principles of peacekeeping, such as impartiality, consent of conflict parties, and use of force for self-defence are questioned. Trends in UN operations are compared with trends in operations related to conflicts in the Post-Soviet space (South Ossetia/Georgia, Abkhazia/Georgia, Tajikistan, Transnistria/Moldova, etc.). The author advocates timeliness for an extended interpretation of the "defence of the mandate" formula instead of the classical "self-defence of the contingent". It is suggested to practically erase the dividing line between operations of the "peacekeeping" type under the UN DPKO, and "political missions" under the UN Political Department. The arsenal of the UN instruments for conflict resolution must be widened from non-intrusive observation missions, conflict prevention and mediation, through support of ceasefire agreements and implementation of peace accords, down to coercive peace enforcement, offensive elements, and UN Charter Chapter VII-based collective operations against aggressive regimes and states. Poorly defined functions and insufficiently clarified use of force limits for the SC-mandated "UN Intervention Brigade" in Democratic Republic of Congo lead to unnecessary involvement of the UN into coercive actions. The experience of the UN "infrastructural hubs" establishing, like the one in Entebbe (Uganda) used for supplying eight African UN operations, is described. New technology for peacekeeping, like the use of unpiloted flying drones, opens new opportunities, but creates legal and practical problems. A distinction of functions between "blue helmets" (specially trained multinational UN contingents) and "green helmets" (regular national armies used by states in foreign conflicts) is recommended, including avoidance of counter-terrorism tasks and strong coercive tasks for the UN peacekeepers. Parallel and interfaced " partnerships" between the limited UN operations and more forceful national/coalition operations in the same areas are suggested instead.

DT Article
DE Russia; soft power; values; image of Russia; post-human civilization;
   political manipulation; technologies; historical project
AB The article considers the controversial question of the applicability of the concept of "soft power" in respect to contemporary Russia and its foreign policy. Under this angle of view, the author undertakes logical and methodological analysis of the concept. Such an analysis is necessary for its transformation from a metaphorical concept into an operational analytical term. There are some semantic constraints in the current use of this concept, so the author suggests it's wider interpretation, which allows introducing some important factors of political influence that are usually not taken into account in publications devoted to the analysis of "soft" impacts. The author emphasizes the need to investigate "reverse effects" of political and ideological influence that can be stretched with changing their modality. The author argues that soft power is built in the form of a certain contextually determined structure with a variable configuration. The key element of this structure, defining its unique profile and internal coherence, is the ability to "establish the meaning". From this perspective, the article considers the question of the presence / absence of "soft power" in Russian politics. The author answers in the broad context opening alternative options of socio-historical development. In this connection, the author dwells on the prospects of the so-called post-human civilization actively discussed in some expert circles, but also on the dehumanizing tendencies inherent in the latest political technologies. The article supposes that Russia now stands objectively as a factor keeping the history on "human path."

AB Key ideas associated with Eurasianism were developed in the 19th century. The narrative of classical Eurasianism in the 1920s was developed to explain that Western civilisation was not superior to other civilisations. Eurasia is the middle continent between other parts of Europe and Asia. There are historical, geographical, and cultural impetuses here which push nations to different forms of association. However, the dissolution of the USSR gave birth to new ideologies and political theories of Eurasianism. The most positive one was extensively developed by the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbaev. Today, we witness the fourth stage of the development of Eurasianism.

AB Complex and ambiguous relations between state officials and civilians in Russia in general, and in Tatarstan in particular, are best reflected by daily communications between traffic police officers and motorists and pedestrians. These short interactions bring up issues of violence and minority discrimination, bribing, and dominant political values. In this paper based on my field research, I explore the practice of ethnic profiling employed by police officers and analyze its effects. I focus on identity construction and its "quality measurement." Unlike a standardized system of weights or "brute facts," law enforcement involves the creation of identities, including selective and sanctioned usage of, and manipulation by, ethnic traits. I conclude that ethnic profiling exists in Tatarstan, but stems not from nationalist inspirations of the controlling agents, but rather as an effect of rational economic decision-making. I also argue that despite its haphazard nature, ethnic minorities in Tatarstan are able to interact with controlling agencies more effectively than the majority, partially due to their alleged ability to employ collective action and partially because of the specific ethnic policy of the Republic.

DE Grand Duchy of Finland; Russian threat; the Russian-Norwegian frontier;

AB The article is devoted to the little-known pages of the "Northern Frontier" history - the Russian-Norwegian border zone, namely the role of the Grand Duchy of Finland in the border policy of the Russian Empire and the Swedish-Norwegian in the border area in 1809-1855. The authors demonstrate that in 1809 the entry of Finland into the Russian Empire strengthened its ability to defend national interests in the far north of Europe. At the same time, the growing influence of the Grand Duchy on the Russian home and foreign policy contributed to the total indoctrination of the Russian-Swedish/Norwegian border and the image of the "Russian threat", which was distributed among the political elite of the Swedish-Norwegian state in the 1820-1850s.
   Distribution of russophobian sentiments in the United Kingdom of Sweden and Norway accelerated the urgency of the Northern Frontier formal delimitation for the Russian-Swedish diplomatic relations in the first half of the 1820s. The "Russian threat" also served the ideological basis for gradual securitization and politicization of the Russian-Norwegian border area.
   Thus, the United Kingdom of Sweden and Norway viewed the whole range of cross-border relations between the population of Finnmark (Sweden-Norway), Ulea borg province (Grand Duchy of Finland) and the Arkhangelsk province (Russian Empire) as one of the potential threats to national security in the second half of the 19th century. The closure of the Finnish-Norwegian section of the Russian-Swedish/Norwegian border in 1852 and joining the anti-Russian coalition with Britain and France, formally enshrined in the so-called the November Treaty of 1855, become the culmination of this process.

AB Internet as a new a new public participation practice. The author sees political participation as an activity that aims to influence authorities' actions. Such an influence may be direct (an accomplishment of certain policy) or indirect (an influence on a selection of people who will accomplish this policy). Due to growing importance of the Internet, we observe new forms of political participation over recent years. On the one hand, the Internet is able to mobilize politically inactive population by reducing differences in knowledge of social and political problems among citizens who belong to different social groups. Nevertheless, on the other hand, digital inequality (ability to access the Internet) reduces possibilities for political participation in the Internet. A gathering of signatures for online petitions takes a special place among new forms of political participation. Online petitions are used in order to draw attention to particular problems, to provide a support for declared goals, and to influence decisions of authorities. The author depicts specific features of environmental issues in online petitions and the main environmental issues that disturb citizens. Additionally, the author discusses whether signing of petitions is a form of such a behavior as slacktivism when organizers and participants restricted themselves only with petition signing or additionally the employed the other forms of activities in order to reach their goals. The study shows that a significant part of online petitions composes of environmental petitions. At the same time, participants most of petitions receive small rate of support. The main variables that influence this form of political participation are sharpness of environmental problems, availability of the Internet, and a level of public activities in the region. The analysis does not found a significant correlation between levels of petitions' support and solutions of environmental problems. The organizers of petition gatherings used the other forms of political participation only in half of their initiatives; and only an absolute minority of participants in these gatherings employed Internet resources for mobilization of potential supporters. That is why one may assume that such a form of political participation is just slacktivism.

TI SUPRANATIONALITY AND THE SUBSIDIARITY PRINCIPLE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
   AND BEYOND
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA English
DT Article
DE European Union; Eurasian Economic Union; supranationality; subsidiarity;
   multilevel governance
AB Decisions of international institutions are not always based exclusively on intergovernmental concord. Their decision-making processes can be supranational as well, while the realization of all decisions still remains predominantly in the hands of participating states. This article is an exploration of regional governance institutions, endowed with supranational quality or traits, from viewpoint of formally sovereign states taking part in them. Political institutionalism is serving as a theoretical basis for this research. It allows focusing on institutions which structure the activity, going beyond national realm. Particular attention is paid to the practices of the EU as the most advanced supranational organization in the world. A supranational quality cab only be acquired by a multilevel political organization. Institutions of the EU are compared in this article to those of the African Union and the Eurasian Economic Union with an aim to make a judgment as concerns their adequacy to the requirements of normative and/or decisional supranationalism. The subsidiarity principle emerges as of central importance in regulating the sharing of competences between supranational institutions and national governments. Two conclusions are deemed most important in this respect. First, it seems unjustified to believe, as in the past, that supranationality always develops linearly, beginning with a decentralized system which then starts to gain in its centralization. Today we can speak of a possibility of bidirectional transformations of multilevel systems, involving supranational institutions and national governments. Second, under the influence of politicization the multilevel governance in the EU in particular is changing its outlines - it becomes postfunctionalist and is being democratized. For such a system, with its newly emerging outlook, rigorous control of the observance of subsidiarity is relatively losing in importance, while supporting its throughput legitimacy (procedural transparency and accountability) becomes a more prominent task.

TI GERMANY, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE SANCTION POLICY TOWARDS RUSSIA
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Germany; European Union; European Parliament; Russia; sanctions;
   political parties
AB The FRG is one of the most important apologists of sanction policy towards Russia within the European Union. This fact was a painful surprise for the Russian political elite. This article is dedicated to investigation of the following questions. Why does German government uphold the sanction policy? Why was the lobbying of the German business weaker than positions of the human-rights-wing in Germany's politics? Is German business lobby really for the "business as usual" policy towards Russia? What is the difference between Germany's stance on human rights and political development in Russia and China? Why should not Russian decisionmakers stake only on economy, military power and others categories of the political realism in their relations with the West? How may the ideological and essential basis of various German political parties change? A personality factor and distrust to the Russian political elite on the part of the German establishment is essential to the sanction policy. Many Russian political observers underestimate the role of values in politics. However, values and prestige as political factors were the key reasons for initiating of the sanction policy. And the significance of values will gradually grow in German political life. Russia's policy towards Ukraine contradicts the principle of multilateralism, which is one of the most important reference points for Germany. The support of the European unity and coordinated interaction between political parties in Germany smooths party differences in relation to the policy towards Russia. But each political power in the FRG has its own original views towards Russia and sanctions. These differences are investigated in full in this article. As shown in sociological researches, the German society is not concerned about the sanction war with Russia. The initiative of sanctions had no goal to transform the political situation in Russia and was only a demonstration of Germany's and the EU position in the Ukrainian crisis. But at the same time, EU-sanctions against Russia were directed on Russian political and economical elite. The factor of values will be more significant in German policy towards Russia than pragmatism. The party system of the EU is similar to that of FRG (a 2.5-party system). Like in Bundestag, those parties which are opposed to sanctions are small and marginalized in the European Parliament as well. The sanctions revocation is connected with negotiations for Donbass.

AB The author offers a partial summary of the results obtained by the laboratory The World during the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars (Institute of Universal History of Russian Academy of Sciences) in the realization of a long-term research project Social mechanisms of mass protest movements in the era of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Empire. A comprehensive study of the various types of mass movements makes to treat with great caution the widespread assertion that the French Revolution was made by the people, by which it is usually meant the peasantry and the urban plebs. Even the plebs mass protests, normally associated with the Revolution, did not usually pursue far-reaching political goals; they were merely a direct response to the information events that caused a surge of collective fear in a situation of general dissatisfaction with the current economic difficulties. However, even these relatively revolutionary events bear no comparison in their scope and duration with the mass popular movements directed against values and ideas of the French Revolution; such movements as the French Vendee, Italian Insorgenze, Egyptian Jihad and others seized entire regions and continued for years.

DE spatial development; Arctic; Barents-Euro region; modelling
AB The paper presents a model of spatial development of the Russian Barents region based on institutional and functional approach. While constructing models of territorial development we describe the socio-economic area development from the point of view of institutional environment. Institutional environment in the model is characterized by the situation in social, economic, industrial and environmental spheres of human activity in the region. The model describes the quality of the institutional environment, including (1) the process of interaction between organizations and actors; (2) the process of interaction between organizations and environment; (3) the effectiveness of actors. Actors in the institutional and functional model of spatial development are companies-entities, reflecting the features of sectoral and industrial structure of the regional economy, as well as people living and working in the region. Organizations in the model are such legal entities that (1) regulate the actions of the participators of various socio-economic, industrial and environmental processes taking place in the socio-economic area of the territories; (2) regulate the actions of various parties involved and are immediately involved in these processes themselves. Institutional and functional development model is designed for territories of the Russian part of the Barents region.

AB The paper presents multi-faceted contextual analysis of state and dynamics of Russian society in conditions of new reality mediated by outer and inner threats and risks with current economic crisis added. Empirical base of the study is formed by the results of three waves of all-Russian sociological monitoring (N-4000) in 2014-2015. A special attention is paid to adoptive capabilities of population, to analysis of economic and political behavior practices of Russians in crisis conditions. Presence is noted in the Russian society of understanding interdependence of inner and outer factors influencing social economic situation of our co-citizens and the course of societal processes in the country, as well as adaptation strategies displayed by members of various professional groups and inhabitants of manifold territorial settlements mediated by their diversified labor incomes and emloyment nature. It is concluded that dynamic movement of the Russian socium towards modern consumer society causes lower dependence grade of the population on government while personal interests begin to prevail over the public ones. Choice made by Russians in favor of 'great-power' institutes is verified allowing to characterize institutional trust in the society not only as hierarchical, but also as a holistic one.

SO ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Golden Horde; Catholic Europe in the Middle Ages; Tatar invasions; Papal
   Curia; anti-Tatar Crusades; Latin sources
AB The author of this article examines a number of military conflicts between the ulus of Jochi and both Hungary and Poland followed the first invasion of the Tatars in these lands in 1241. For the most part, the author's analysis is based on information of synchronous Latin sources in comparison with information contained in Russian and Mamluk chronicles. In addition to the Hungarian, Polish, and German chronicles, the author resorts to the use of the contents of the papal letters to Eastern Europe, which provide both the most reliable information about military conflicts and information on the Papal Curia's measures to improve the defense of eastern borders of the Latin world from the Tatar raids.
   The article examines the political events in chronological order, according to the reigns of the Jochid rulers. During the reign of Batu, Latin sources indicate extreme concern about the possible resumption of the western expansion of the Tatars in spite of the fact that, in reality, Tatar military activity on the eastern borders of Catholic Europe had an extremely minor character. On the contrary, during the reign of Berke, Tatars carried a very destructive raid on Lesser Poland. However, further Tatar expansion was interrupted by an unexpected collapse of the Mongol Empire. The subsequent reign of khan Mengu-Timur was distinguished with relative tension with the Catholic Europe, but the actual attack on Hungary and Poland took place only under the khans Tuda-Mengu and Tula-Buga.
   Later, under the khans Tokhta and Uzbek, the tension between the Golden Horde and Catholic Europe weakened considerably, which, in particular, allowed the beginning of the Hungarian territorial expansion into Moldova. However, the end of the reign of Uzbek Khan was characterized by a sharp deterioration of relations between the Golden Horde and Poland, which was associated with the beginning of the war of Galician succession. Analysis of the course of this war shows the apparent weakening of the influence of the Golden Horde in the former Galicia-Volyn principality, which contributed to the further expansion of Poland and Lithuania on the territory of modern Ukraine.

AB The legacy of the great Russian historian and writer N.M. Karamzin, which in December 2016 marks 250 years, continues to be the subject of heated debate not so much literaryaesthetical as political-ideological. Russian Government has always been interested in the apology of Karamzin as a guardian of conservatism, while the opposition has sometimes been tempted to accentuate in his legacy the features of frondeurian nonconformity. Meanwhile, it is clear that the multifaceted oeuvre of N.M. Karamzin, close the very source of the "Golden Age" of Russian culture, contains a wealth of potential of national intellectionalism as such, fills the branches of the national tradition with nourishing cultural sap. It is this "Karamzin phenomenon" that has allowed to interpret the worldviews of Karamzin as "liberal-conservative", ie combining the belief in the potential of a free person, and simultaneously the values of enlightened Government; in European universalism and at the same time in the distinctive values of national culture.

TI Nation-Building: Identity Policies in Post-Soviet States
SO MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE nation; empire; USSR; identity; post-Soviet space; politics of memory;
   nation-building
AB Nation-building was one of the main problems faced by post-Soviet states after the collapse of the USSR. Many of these states did not have a long tradition of nationhood, and they were not ethno-culturally homogeneous. In some cases the political independence which came with the fall of the Soviet Union was not even the result of a nation-wide struggle (e.g. in Central Asia and Belorussia). All of this created a serious challenge for the political and intellectual elites who had to legitimize the sovereignty of their societies. This article explores different policies of nation-building in the post-Soviet space. Among them are the invention (or fundamental revision) of the historical narrative, the invention of a particularist cultural and political tradition, the active use of postcolonial discourse and an ideology of ethnical nationalism. In addition, the article deals with other aspects of the nation-building process, such as identity conflicts within societies (e.g. the East and West divide in Ukraine and Belarus, and the Moldavanian-Roumanian divide in Moldova) and 'memory wars'-conflicts between different interpretations of history. The article concludes that identity policies in post-Soviet states were largely successful, because none of the newly independent states became a failed state. On the other hand, nation-building in these states has not been fully accomplished, which manifests itself in the weak loyalty of citizens. In addition, some post-Soviet states have so far proven unable to maintain a nationwide discourse which would include ethnic, linguistic and other minorities.

DT Article
DE integration; measurement integration; internal migrants; visible
   minorities; interethnic relations
AB Massive inflow of migrants into Russian regions leads to tensions between them and local communities. Majority of migrants are foreigners but the local community has also issues with the "visible minorities" who, being Russian citizens, are internal migrants, especially from Northern Caucasus. Their being Russian citizens makes it hard to use traditional measures of the migration politics towards them. The potential for local communities consolidation is seen in the use of measures to integrate internal migrants. The article looks at the approaches to studying and measuring migrants' integration and suggests methods of integration assessment. Author analyzes factors and level of integration of internal migrants who are "visible minorities". It is shown that migrants' integration level differs according to the region and is associated with their socio-demographic characteristics, migration experience, socio-economic positions and value orientations. Special attention is paid to the analysis of local communities' integration. It is shown that integration levels of migrants and non migrants into local community are closely connected. In the regions where local communities are better integrated, migrants' integration is more successful: favorable social context facilitates migrant integration. At the same time, local community integration level is associated with the socio-economic and political context of region population formation. The article is based on the research conducted by the Institute of Sociology RAS in 2014-2015 in 4 regions of Russia. 2760 non-migrants and 1003 migrants were interviewed. The migrants were "visible minorities", mainly from Northern Caucasus.

Authors present data that gives answers to the following questions: Do respondents regard EU a partner, a friend or an enemy? To what extent this organization is regarded as a strong and effective actor in international relations? Should we build relations with EU as a unit or rather deal with individual European states? How do Russians evaluate EU sanctions against their country? Analysis of the answers to these and other questions led authors to certain conclusions. EU image in Russian society is ambivalent and unstable. The majority of respondents see the EU as a strong but gradually weakening "decorative union" due to American influence. The image contains indicators of "aging". The majority of respondents regard EU as a partner, but they are disappointed in it being such an unreliable and deceiving one. About a quarter of respondents consider EU to be an enemy; only a few see it as a friend. At the same time, respondents regard Russia as an integral part of Europe and stand for the one and only scenario of its future - neighborhood and partnership relations with EU.

TI MEGAREGIONS IN GLOBALIZING ECONOMY

LA Russian
DT Article
DE globalization; fragmentation; regional economic integration;
   mega-regions; integration threshold
AB The bipolar nature of modern world - globalization and fragmentation - speeds up regional movements and economic integration. These processes in peripheral regions are expected to grow more vigorously than in the developed regions. Fragmentation redoubled the number of national economies and reduced their average size. To withstand the impact of globalization peripheral countries apply to their regional potential: they increase the connectivity of integration unions and regional infrastructure. The developed countries with their oversupplied home markets concentrate on outward expansion. Interaction of these heterogeneous foreign trade strategies gave birth to new links in the system of international economic relations - mega-regionalism and interregional constructions including transoceanic integration unions like TTP. The world economy is in store for a new division line because of the coexistence and competition between mega-regional and transoceanic integration unions. One of the possible repercussions of these events may be the emergence of geo-political and geo-economic triad - NATO, TTIP, TTP. Under such international situation peripheral economies are able to build regional integration unions and function for many years but mostly without any noticeable progress. Low internal connectivity hampers their movement towards the integration threshold. That's why integration process should be analyzed by dividing it into two stages - initial (start) period (until reaching integration threshold and nature stage (integration build mainly on its own recourses and base). The possibility of measuring quantitatively the approach to integration threshold allows to determine the division line between two stages. Duration of the first stage is 10-12 and more years. The creation of a successful project of regional economic integration takes at least 20-30. Proposals are made how to measure the progress of regional integration projects.

TI FOREIGN INVESTMENT INTO RUSSIAN AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA

DT Article
DE automotive industry; foreign investment; joint venture; Russia
AB This article analyzes the scope and localization of foreign investments into foreign Russia automotive industry. Since 2000s many transnational automotive companies has implemented their assemble-carsprojects in Russia. Large population, low level of motorization and reduction of taxes on auto components became significant factors for attracting investors into the industry. As a result, by 2015 the share of locally-made foreign models increased to 52%. By the end of 2015, there were 16 plants producing cars of foreign brands. Depending on the volume of investment and the method of project's implementation, all enterprises can be divided into several groups: assembly without significant FDI, joint ventures with national companies and FDI to construction of full cycle factories. Among these groups there are enterprises established on the basis of old automobile centers, at the facilities of non-core plants, and newly-built factories. Also, the article analyzes development of the automotive industry in a difficult economic and political situation in 2014-2015. Falling consumer demand for products led to a significant reduction in companies' revenue, and many of them had to stop the assembly operations. At the same time, Chinese companies entered into several agreements to build a plant in Russia. During the period from January to November 2015, the Russian market of new vehicles reduced by 34.5% as compared to the same period in 2014. The Russian government decided to resume the state recycling program in September 2014 to contain the continuing fall in demand. Later, in April 2015 a state program of preferential car loan was entered to further car market support.

TI DIVERSIFICATION OF RUSSIAN ECONOMY UNDER SANCTIONS
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian economy; diversification of production; import substitution;
   economic sanctions; technology; investment; transnationalization; global
   value chains
AB The article estimates the prospects of diversifying the structure of the Russian economy under current Western sanctions. When they were imposed, diversification, the need for which has long been recognized, took the form of import substitution. Sanctions limited the potential of import substitution through several channels. The essential equipment and technology are under export ban. The access of Russian banks and corporations to international capital markets is restricted and this deprives them from financing investments into import-substituting production. There is a ban on transactions with individuals and legal entities included into the sanctions' lists. Many Russian industries use outdated equipment and badly need modern foreign technologies. The cost of imported equipment, technology, components, parts and materials has grown along with the depreciation of the Russian currency. The Russian economy needs foreign investment, especially in the form FDI which is accompanied by the transfer of technology and expertise. The reduction of the FDI inflows slows down the development of the national economy and worsens its technological backwardness. The hope for receiving financing and technology from China are justified only to a small part. In fact, Chinese banks are extremely cautious while considering credits to the Russian borrowers. They estimate the implied risks as rather high and, require costly guarantees and often tie the credit with the purchase of Chinese goods. Chinese investments are mostly limited to general statements and protocols of intent. Basically, it should be remembered that Asian countries are primarily users, rather than creators of advanced technology. The scope of high technologies that Chinese and South Korean companies can freely dispose is very limited. Usually, the consent of Western owners for their further transfer is mandatory. The progress in import substitution can be traced almost exclusively in the area of food production in Russia. However, the quality of many foodstuffs has worsened while prices have gone up. So far, it is only in theory that falling oil prices can help the Russian economy to get rid from the notorious Dutch disease. In effect, the import substitution process is slowing down. Long-term objectives of development of the Russian economy do not correspond with widescale import substitution. Russia is interested in improving its international industrial specialization. Under the current conditions this aim can be achieved only through inclusion and integration into the global value chains, not through frontal import substitution. Expansion of ties with European and American companies in the field of science and technology remains a necessary condition for deep modernization of the Russian industry. Thus, success in the area of diversification depends on the normalization of political relations with the leading countries of the West.

TI RUSSIAN MUSEOLOGY IN THE 1930S-2010S: AN EXPERIENCE OF A HISTORIOGRAPHY
   STUDY
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE museology; museum science; historiography of museums
AB The study on the historiography of Russian museology, started in 2015, needs to continue. Knowledge of the museum history makes it possible to maintain that at the turn of the 1920-30-s the paradigm of museology changed. Categories of the Marxist-Leninist philosophy - theory and practice - were the basis for the new concept of museum science. It was formulated at the First All-Russia Museum Congress. Very soon, the theory was understood as instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government. The concept of practice was regarded as the implementation of those directives in museums. Museums were stripped of academic significance and were turned into institutions for political education. Rebirth of museology occurred in the post-World War II period. The main event in this process was the extended session of the Institute of Regional Studies and Museum Work, held in 1948. The participants of the session returned the significance of an academic discipline for museology. A.M. Razgon published an article in The Great Soviet Encyclopedia in 1974. He wrote that museology was an academic discipline which studied the origin of museums, their public functions, and questions of theory and methods of museum science. Later, in 1988, this definition was repeated in the book Muzeevedenie. Muzei istoricheskogo profilya [Museology. Museums of A Historical Profile]. The authors called museology an academic discipline. At the same time, they included independent academic disciplines ( museum theory, history of museum science, museum source studies) in its structure. In fact, they reflected on museology as on a complex of academic knowledge on museum science, but did not recognize it. In the 1990s, the socio-political development of the Russian society hanged. Consequently, a new non-politicized concept of museology was required. Response to the public demand was The Russian Museum Encyclopedia (Moscow, 2001. Vol. 1-2). The authors of the Encyclopedia summed up Russian museology, identified gaps in museum knowledge. Their definition of museology, in fact, was the same as in the 1980s. Museologists of today underestimate the achievements of their predecessors. We can say there was no shift in the museology paradigm. Nevertheless, there is a clear movement towards a change of the paradigm. It is expressed in the intensive research of the museum science history, in the attention to the experience of pre-revolutionary museology, in the development of the historiography of museum science. The widening and deepening of problems, the improvement of museum study methodology identify new questions for discussion, and their solution needs a new investigation.

TI The "Ethical" Dimension of Heidegger's Philosophy: Consideration of
   Ethics in Its Original Source
SO RUSSIAN STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB Heidegger and Ethics remains a controversial topic among Heidegger scholars. What appears particularly troublesome is the conjunction itself, [which hints on a link between] Heidegger and ethics. Heidegger proposes to consider ethics in its original source, distinguishing it from morality and from ethics as a philosophical discipline, which often concerns with social or political issues. Heidegger distinguishes ?u6 from ??u6, preferring to discuss ethos instead of ethics. Heidegger's main hero here is Aristotle. When referring to Aristotelian texts, Heidegger attempts nothing less but to rethink the first part of first philosophy. The leading question in interpretation of Aristotle is the question of the objectness of Being, in which both Being of human and Being of life are interpreted. Heidegger asks himself what the phenomenological foundation for explicating the [meaning] of man is, and what categories evolve from this foundation. This article focuses on the same question. It begins with the discussion of hermeneutic phenomenology and concludes with the analysis of thinking rooted in historical Being - the two projects that signify important milestones in Heidegger's development.

TI RUSSIAN MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM: ILLUSIONS OF THE PAST, THE CHIMERA OF
   CONTEMPORANEITY
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russia; political culture; multiparty system; revolution; paternalism;
   authoritarianism; bolshevism
AB The author refutes the idea that progress of multiparty system in Russia equaled the development of democratization. On the contrary, origin of multiparty system in Russia in the late XIX - early XX century was the symptom of fragmentation of society, which, in turn, indicated the approaching system crisis. Russian political parties grew from above, not from below; they embodied the processes of ideological self-expression of intelligentsia, rather than awakening of basic class forces. The fact that political parties originally emerged on the outskirts of the Empire (firstly on the left, then on the right side of the political spectrum) is another characteristic of the process of political party building as reflection of the approaching disintegration of Empire and division of society. It also indicates utter weakness of liberal center parties. All of this was fully confirmed in 1917. Events of the late XX century reflect the cultural and genetic nature of the continuing archaic character of the mass political culture in the country. The basis of this culture, namely the paternalistic and hierarchic patterns of mass behavior, remains unchanged. The existing political parties, as a rule, merely mimic the presence of a normal political life in the country, contributing to consolidation of neopaternalistic relations in politics and archaic mass consciousness. The author underlines the necessity to study the real subject of Russian political history - the very "dark masses", with which the elite still cannot find a common language.

TI Confessions in Imperial Russia: analytical overview of historiography
SO BYLYE GODY
LA English
DT Article
DE Russian Empire; confessional policy; historiography
AB Scholarship on confessional history-the history of religious institutions, practices, and interactionhas undergone profound change, especially in the last quarter century. Although bibliographical resources are woefully inadequate, the change has been enormous, reflecting all four dimensions of "confessional history": (1) institutional religion (and its servitors); (2) believers; (3) ethno-confessional interrelations; and (4) the state's relationship to all of the foregoing. That massive accumulation, and of late more diversified and independent, makes possible a systematic analysis of the "confessional factor" in ethnic issues and the state's response to them. It is essential, as all this literature demonstrates, to emphasize not only the diachronic (temporal) but also spatial (geographic) dimension, for the role of the religious factor varied sharply, not only for particular confessions, but also over time and space. The historiography has undergone a corresponding evolution, reflecting at once the dynamics and desiderata of Russian political history as well as the disciplinary evolution of scholarship on religion in the modern world. In the Russian case, this evolution falls into three main periods: pre-revolutionary, twentieth-century (Soviet), and post-Soviet, a periodization that applies for both Russian and foreign scholarship.

AB The September 2015 elections in the regions of Russia resulted in victories for the major pro-government party, United Russia, in 11 regional legislative elections and brought success to incumbent chief executives in 21 gubernatorial elections. The performance of United Russia was better than in the previous series of regional elections, which is particularly important given that in many respects, the 2015 regional elections served as a rehearsal for the 2016 national legislative races. The results of the elections generally attested to the efficiency of political and institutional manipulation tools developed by the Russian authorities in recent years.

AB The paper takes the problem of social order or the conditions of the possibility of modern society that consists of a multitude of rational actors who pursue their private interests while frequently having opposing goals into consideration. The paper demonstrates that the problem in question, also known as a Hobbesian problem, has been transmitted to the center of the discourse of social science long ago since being formulated for the first time in 1651 by Thomas Hobbes in his famous Leviathan. The solution of the problem of social order as proposed by Hobbes, consisting in the recognition of the necessity to constitute a dominant political authority, i.e., the state which is capable of maintaining stable social relations, caused an intensive theoretical debate that continues to this day. Social theorists have proposed a large variety of answers to the question posed by Hobbes, but none can be considered as final or comprehensive. The paper makes an attempt to reconstruct various theoretical and methodological approaches to the problem of social order, from the solution proposed by Hobbes (including its reformulation by Talcott Parsons) to the analytical concepts of social order elaborated by contemporary thinkers belonging to different theoretical orientations. The article makes the conclusion that translating the old problem of classical political philosophy of modernity into the language of actual contemporary social theory allows the problematization of the heuristic foundations of political discourse of modernity by operationalizing its key concept.

DT Article
DE Marxian theory of economic reproduction; the institutional matrices
   theory; X- and Y-economies; institutional theory; reproduction of fixed
   assets
AB The paper attempts to apply the principle of methodological institutionalism and the theory of institutional matrices, particularly the latter's concept of the structure of X- and Y-economies, to the analysis of the processes of economic reproduction. In fact, we follow Marx and other scholars of classical political economy who in these processes identified the associated reproduction of social relations. In the reproduction model of Karl Marx he, on the one hand, identified movement of goods (products, works, services) in their real and monetary forms and, on the other hand, institutional and social arrangements that facilitate this movement in specific types of societies. The paper develops the idea that, over time, this insight about the dual nature of economic relations (supported later by Karl Polanyi and others) has been the neglected and lost sight of, until now. We also argue that Marx made his analysis of economic reproduction in respect of only one particular case - a capitalist economy, which we describe as the Y-type economy. With respect to the X-economies, a similar analysis of economic reproduction processes in accordance with Marx's model has not been carried out. This paper is the first one, in which we show that economic reproduction of goods in the X- and Y-economies is based on different structures of economic institutions. An external cause, influencing the difference between the prevailing economic institutions, is assumed to be differences in climatic conditions. The results of empirical statistical calculations are presented as proof of this assumption. It is also shown that indicators of economic reproduction differ in proportion between different institutional frameworks. As an example, results of the comparative analysis of capital accumulation in X-and Y-economies are presented, supporting the main conclusions of the paper.

AB In the article the history and features of the Russian political science community's formation are analyzed. Apart from the milestones, the authors consider the main versions of the community's emergence, as well as the phenomenon of community itself. In the course of the research the authors used various methods and sources: content analysis of information resources and documents of the professional organizations of political scientists of the Russian Federation, surveys and interviews of experts-political scientists and public servants. All this allowed not only to characterize the political science community by its features description, but also to reveal the existing development problems, considering regional political science schools' development and functioning dynamics, as well as the role of political science community as an expert community in the state policy-making. The wide range of experts having taken part in surveys helped to describe the situation from various sides and to show a picture both from political scientists' position and from high-ranked decision-makers' viewpoint. In the conclusion of the article authors form conceptual conclusions which can be used by the professional organizations of the Russian community of political scientists to increase efficiency of their activity, develop regional political schools in the Russian Federation, and also produce constructive dialogue between the authorities and expert communities to improve quality of the decisions made and provide academia's involvement in the research field. Authors emphasize that the present article is not exhaustive, and express their hope that other researchers will join the discussion on the role of political scientists' professional community, which will considerably increase the quality of the research.

DT Article
DE ethno-political and ethno-social conflicts; foreign policy factors;
   post-Soviet states; nation-building; conflict management; USA; Russia;
   EU countries
AB The article discusses the role of foreign policy factors in the emergence, escalation and management of ethno-social and ethno-political conflicts in the post-Soviet space. One of distinguishing features of such conflicts is that they have both ethnic and socio-cultural components, and are not only conflicts of interests, but also conflicts of values, norms, traditions and identities. It is shown that in the modern era of globalization and regionalization, the analysis of domestic escalation factors and management of various types of conflicts with an ethnic component has to be interconnected with investigation of foreign policy factors in such conflicts. In the post-Soviet space, the most serious ethno-political conflicts emerged in the south-east of Ukraine, Transnistria in Moldova, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as well as in Central Asian countries (in the latter case, an active role is played by international terrorist organizations, including Taliban and the "Islamic State", which are banned in Russia). The conflict dynamics in all these cases is determined to a large extent by foreign policy factors: by involvement of the United States, the European Union countries, Russia, and in some cases Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other major regional players. The authors argue that none of ethno-political conflicts in the post-Soviet space can be effectively resolved without Russia's participation. It is shown that effective management of ethno-social and ethno-political conflicts in the post-Soviet states as well as prevention of their catastrophic development scenarios can be achieved by nation-building in these states based on civic rather than ethnic identities. The resource of civic (public-civic) identity could be a great asset in this regard. However, in practice, the choice of the nation-building and identity formation direction is often determined by the influence of global and regional players: the U.S., the EU, Russia, China and several other countries. In general, effective management of ethno-political and ethno-social conflicts in the post-Soviet space requires consideration of a number of factors: on the one hand, history, mentality and values of peoples and ethnic groups living in these countries, and on the other hand, - the impact of diverse and rapidly changing foreign policy factors.

DT Article
DE Eurasia; transboundary region; Russia-China interaction; politics;

AB The article analyzes the current status and new development trends in Russian-Chinese transboundary region, which extends to the vast and reach area equal to India. Due to some economical, geographical and psychological reasons, by the beginning of the second decade of 21st century, the two countries' governments could neither effectively explore a huge integrational potential of this transboundary space in order to reinforce economic and humanitarian foundation of Russia-China strategic partnership, nor transform this space into a territory of social stability and economic prosperity. Currently, Moscow and Beijing actively attempt to promote pretentious geo-political and economic projects for greater Eurasia along with their efforts to work out new agendas so as to speed up social and economic development of the Northeast China and the Russian Pacific. In their initial version, these projects have nothing to do with each other. However, the local authorities on both sides of the border actively support such efforts and try to promote their interests within the projects, viewing them as appropriate means to overcome (at least partially) the barriers, which constrain the economic progress of their districts. At the same time, Russian-Chinese transboundary region is becoming an operating juncture of international integration in the eastern part of Eurasia being of keen interest for other Pacific countries, primarily Japan and South Korea. The development and improvement of this region as one of fundamentals for the Russia-China strategic partnership and, simultaneously, a platform of international cooperation in Eastern Eurasia seem to be the only real opportunity not merely to overcome centuries-old backwardness of this periphery, but to make a breakthrough in bilateral relations. The author proposes to abandon the excessive enthusiasm and illusion as concerns the coming "co-junction" in the western part of the continent, and to refocus on the Russian-Chinese pragmatic cooperation in the eastern segment of Eurasia and North Pacific, which have potential to build a new basis for economic and security system of Eastern Eurasia on the platform of interaction between Russia, China and all interested parties.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE politics; epistemology; reference; religion; diversity; modernization;
   changes; democracy; identity; sociocultural factors and meanings
AB Extension of the theory of politics to include sociocultural meanings in its explanatory scheme reflects the current uncertainty of its theoretical and methodological foundations, politico-institutional references, political and ideological implications. Fluctuation of the contours of the "familiar world" corresponds to rising distrust in the existing institutions and actors, suggesting a crisis of their legitimacy and effectiveness. A qualitatively new nature of conflict in society, archaization of political ideologies and practices, transformation of the structures of social and power configurations indicate a change in the reference values of load-bearing structures of political life, reflexive schemes and ideological intentions. Redefinition of the standard linear epistemes and ideological discourses of modernity is accompanied by incorporation of socio-cultural referents and new references of modernity into the theoretical constructs. Religion ceases to be just a private affair of a particular person, and returns to the public space in various forms, reflecting the diversification and diversity of the semantic and practical presence in the theoretical schemes and political practices. Many political issues acquire social resonance only because they are given a religious meaning, whereas religious intentions are in demand primarily in the political space. The religious reference is perceived differently in the modern world, causing controversy and debate about the prospects for human development, actualizing new methodological and ideological constructions.

AB The penetration of European standards and norms in the life of Russian society, their influence on the culture, the legislation and administrative traditions, these questions remain relevant over 300 years, since the beginning of the Europeanization of Russia by Peter I. The most important problem lies in the degree of adoption of the European experience, its relevance and adaptation to the Russian conditions. The question of penetration of the western norms into education, science, a family and other spheres which successfully functioned and were reproduced on a powerful internal resource of the Russian traditional culture is relevant too.
   The article is based on archival materials. It discusses the experience of the Russian emperors to reform Tobolsk prison castle in accordance with the European and Russian samples, and the results of this policy. The author draws attention to the pattern that emerged over 200 years: the attempt even a partial introduction to the prison castle European humanist values necessarily accompanied by a crisis of Imperial power and ended with its collapse in 1917. A return to the inquisitorial part of the prison and the rejection of the humane treatment of prisoners entailed the stabilization of the government. The author analyzes the causes of this phenomenon, comparing the cultural-historical conditions for prison reform in Russia and Europe, as well as differences in socio-economic and political development. The article also presents new data on the history of the exile of the Romanovs to Siberia in 1601 and 1918.

AB Ideologies of authoritarian and neo-authoritarian regimes are analyzed in the article. The analysis is carried out in three clusters: "rudimentary" authoritarian regimes, post-colonial dictatorships, neo-authoritarian regimes. Within the first cluster regimes are subdivided into two subgroups: authoritarian monarchies and "communist regimes". The regimes united in the third cluster are also subdivided into two subgroups: post-Soviet regimes and neo-authoritarian regimes in Africa, Asia and Latin America. It is noted that in the age of decline of ideologies on a global scale authoritarian and neo-authoritarian regimes as before need political ideologies for legitimacy of their power. However, in contemporary epoch which sets authoritarian and neo-authoritarian regimes before new and much more complicated challenges they are forced to use more flexibility in ideological issues in order to adapt themselves to the rapidly changing world. Ideologies of such regimes lose former integrity and become "multi-layer", eclectic. Such "non-ideological" element as corruption becomes a part of ideologies of neo-authoritarian regimes. But herewith priority of the state as the highest value remains "bearing structure" of political ideologies of all authoritarian and neo-authoritarian regimes. The human being, protection of its rights and liberties are recognized by neo-authoritarian regimes as values that occupy secondary and subordinate place in ideological hierarchy and political practice of these regimes.

DT Article

AB On the basis of results of the sociological monitoring study held by the Institute of Sociology, Russian Academy of Sciences, the author analyzes the features of the "new crisis reality" and its influence on the political process in contemporary Russia. The author also pays attention to the citizens' perception of activities of the authorities of different levels and of the key public agencies. It is noted in the article that the reorientation of the mass attention from the foreign policy agenda to the problems of the everyday practices substantially reduced the level of confidence in the majority of the state and public institutions to the one of the "Crimean period". At the same time, in accordance with the sociological data, social reaction to the crisis is "childish": Russian society seeks no economic or political changes and associates all its hopes for coming out of the crisis with the head of the state. In this context, the author focuses on the prospects for the evolution of the political regime and for the possible reaction of the Russian society to one or another way of this evolution. The author particularly tries to answer the question whether there are social preconditions for the rebirth of the "super-presidential republic" to an authoritarian personalized regime. Building his analysis on the sociological data, the author gives a negative answer to this question, noting that most Russians associate the future of their state with the type of organization of public life that ensures human rights, freedom of expression of the individual, i.e. with democracy. They do it even in spite of the critical attitude to the "Russian version" of democracy. It is also noted in the article that one can observe contours of a future coalition that is interested in the "Russian version" of democracy. This coalition of the so-called "self-sufficient Russians", on the one hand, focuses on stability and on constructive dialogue with the authorities, and on the other hand, these "self-sufficient Russians" do not need government patronage.

DT Article
DE crisis; the "new economic reality"; labor rights; employment; social
   unrest; protest; protest activity; solidarity; individual adaptation
AB Author, basing on the monitoring sociological data of the Institute of Sociology (Russian Academy of Sciences), analyzes influence of a "new crisis reality" on the minds of the Russian citizens and on their readiness to defend their social and economic rights and interests. Sociological data demonstrate that the society today is focused on the preservation of stability, albeit a crisis stability. And such effective world-wide popular ways of legitimate rights' protection as participation in the enterprises' management, street protests, solidarity actions and strikes are not too popular among Russians. At the same time, author emphasizes that the level of protest activity, as well as other forms of civic participation, are not directly derived from the social displeasure. The level of social activity and other forms of social participation used to go through serious fluctuations, unexpected bursts and downturns. Collapse of social and labor rights, of the right to move (including the right to travel abroad) and to peacefully express discontent, collapse of the right for a fair trial or freedom of business could seriously politicize society, encourage it to become more active and take solidarity actions to defend fundamental civil interests. As the author claims, these problem are especially true for social groups and strata, that are recognizing link between level and especially quality of life and presence/absence of political freedoms. In this regard the author analyzes prospects for new forms and practices that citizens would use to defend their labor and other socio-economic rights (although, author notes, many of these practices are of a network-informal nature and combine social and political agenda). Also, examined is potential of expressng radical forms of social discontent. The author stresses that a "creeping" legitimization of violence, used as instrument for resolving of economic disputes and for the fight against political opponents, is particularly dangerous in this context. Besides, it is noted that radical forms of protest could be provoked by limitations of many legal forms of defence of workers' legitimate rights and interests, that are reduced within the confines of struggle against extremism.

TI A COMPARISON OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE JOCHID KHANS CONTAINED IN "MU'IZZ

DE Golden Horde; "Mu'izz al-Ansab"; khans; coins; "Tavarikh-i Guzida-i
   Nusrat-nama"
AB This article compares the numismatic data on the Jochids with information of two genealogical sources (Paris copy of "Mu'izz al-Ansab" and Leningrad copy of "Tavarikh-i Guzida-i Nusrat-nama") in order to identify the khans listed in these sources. Based on a comparative analysis of the data provided by these sources we have described and identified their degree of political engagement. A. Isin believed that "Mu'izz al-Ansab" was politically biased against the descendants of Urus Khan. The author of "Mu'izz al-Ansab" highlighted the khans graphically. The article does not investigated the khans from the descendants of Batu, who were also highlighted graphically. The list of the khans contained in "Mu'izz al-Ansab" is following: Tokhtamish Khan, Jalal al-Din Khan, Kerimberdy Khan, Kopek Khan, Kadyrberdy Khan, Seid Ahmed Khan, Muhammed Khan, Dauletberdy Khan, Timur Khan, Timur-Qutluq Khan, Timur Khan, Muhammed Khan, Shadibek Khan, Ghiyas al-Din Khan, Dervish Khan, Urus Khan, Toqtaqiya Khan, Timur Malik Khan, Barak Khan. All these khans are indicated there as the descendants of Tuqa-Timur, the son of Jochi. None of the descendants of Shiban Khan, son of Jochi, are indicated in "Mu'izz al-Ansab" as a khan. Dzhumaduk is identified as a potential khan by a postscript next to his name in the following sentence: "they want to make him ruler despite the fact that his father is still alive". Thus, we can say that "Mu'izz al-Ansab" is a source sympathetic to the Tuqa-Timurids. A version that "Mu'izz al-Ansab" was compiled against Urus Khan and his descendants could not be proved. The list of the khans contained in "Tavarikh-i Guzida-i Nusrat-nama" is following (excluding the descendants of Batu): Shiban Khan, Ming-Timur Khan, Mahmoud Khwaja Khan, Khizr Khan, Abul Khair Khan, Sheikh Haidar Khan, Said Baba Khan, Khush-Haidar Khan, Haji Muhammed Khan, Sayidak Khan, Mahmudak Khan, Abak Khan, Khizr Khan, Timur Khwaja Khan, Bazarchi Khan, Tokhtamish Khan, Muhammed Khan, Ghiyas al-Din Khan, Timur Qutluq Khan, Muhammed Khan, Ahmad Khan, Shadibek Khan, Mustafa Khan, Dervish Khan, Dzhegre Khan, Urus Khan, Barak Khan. 13 descendants of Shiban, 12 descendants of Tuqa-Timur and 1 descendant of Tangut are indicated in "Tavarikh-i Guzida-i Nusratnama" as the khans. On this basis, we can say that "Tavarikh-i Guzida-i Nusratnama" is moderately pro-Shibanid source.

DE ethnopolitical conflict; multidimensional inequality; regulatory

AB A distinctive feature of today's world is the growth of conflicts and their ethnic basis which predetermines the increased interest in the problems of ethnicity, ethnic relations, the nation-state in the modern scientific and socio-political discourse. It is caused by blurring the social foundations of the old world order, destruction of the social space, which has been called "social state". As a result, today's society is not just segmented and heterogeneous, but also conflict prone. Exhaustion of previous mechanisms of economic growth and legitimation of power exposed social problems and imbalances in the current system and left the man alone against the deteriorating socio-economic situation. In the modem political space there are no political parties or civil society institutions that can offer a way out of the current situation, to formulate a constructive agenda for the world community. The protests are largely atomized, reflecting the peculiarities of the social structure of modern society. Under these conditions, ethnicity is often the only unshakable foundation of collective identity to which people can resort to protect and defend their interests. The author analyzes the socio-political context of aggravation of ethnic tensions and the growth of ethno-political conflicts in the last decade, which threatens the integrity and sovereignty of modem nation-states. The author proposes a system of aggregated indicators to assess not only the deterioration of the socio-economic situation, but also the potential for inter-ethnic tensions. In the final part of this article author discussed the situation evolving in the Russian Federation. The author called imbalances in socio-economic development of the country, which can potentially lead to an increase in inter-ethnic tensions, formulated general methodological approaches to the development of socio-economic policy in a multi-ethnic state.

AB This article tackles the issue of interconnectedness between the global economic crisis in 2008 and the "For Fair Elections" movement in Russia in 2011-2012. Studies have shown that the 2008 crisis has affected political attitudes of Russian citizens that might have contributed to the mass mobilization in 2011-2012. To test this hypothesis, a dataset covering public protest events from 2008 to 2012 in Perm krai and Tyumen oblast' has been developed. The comparison between the cases demonstrates different dynamics of contention, however, a similar composition of protests: local/urban governance issues are the most frequent, closely followed by political/civil rights and economic demands. The comparison indicates that the connections between the 2008 crisis and the 2011-2012 movement are mostly indirect: economic misfortunes caused some groups to protest; it helped some political parties to create broad coalitions based on these grievances, which later became the pillars of the 2011-2012 movement.

DT Article
DE political myth; mythologem; mythology; chronotope; meme; media reality;
   history; ideology
AB Today we cannot but notice the sequence of the considerable changes in the present-day social and cultural order through the obvious process of its invasion by certain semiotic constructs, possibly described as political myths, and nearly all of them closely connected with the issue of past/present/future glory. This glory could be lost (e.g., the collapse of the USSR), or gained anew (e.g., the joining of Crimea in 2014). The concepts of glory and victory in Russian political discourse are bound up with each other so closely that it is difficult to divide them. Besides, glory and victory are being gradually possessed by the establishment. At the same time, political myths are the means and the aim of this process. Myth comes forward as a universal code, and moreover, as a universal social-cultural matrix which contains patterns of ethics that are to be installed into the society. Besides, myth is a structure based upon the category of shaping the reality in which people may believe, not the category of belief. In the sphere of the media, myth broadcasts itself mainly through memes, using them both as instruments and as a certain communication channel. The structure of a meme is semiotic, while there is still a communicative difference between a meme and a myth. The idea of political glory is closely connected with the sphere of myth and with the concepts of time and space. This kind of integration makes up what Bakhtin called a "chronotope." Three main myths of historical glory in present-day political discourse can be distinguished: the myth of Byzantium and the so-called "The Fifth Empire," the myth of the "Polite People," and the myth of "Panfilov's Twenty-Eight."

AB The current stage in development of Russian civil society bears the appearance of new forms of expression and realization of the interests of society. Terms of civic activity in Russia are associated primarily with increased activity of NGOs, the growth of social movements and networked civic movements and development of Internet technologies. Networked movement uses the principles of equality, resource interaction, voluntary participation, developing in the geography of their activities and number of participating citizens. The Internet provides new forms of civic engagement. Civic engagement appears on the Internet via web portals and sites, civic applications and social networking, crowdsourcing and crowdfunding platforms. Social networks and online applications provide significant opportunities for communication, transmission of information, resources, research, and become a really effective tool for horizontal relationships and connections in the community. Large-scale protests and civic companies are formed with the help of networks. Internet resources allow operatively spread information about activities and events, help to effectively mobilize members of civil activity.

TI The Political Organization of Rus' in the 10th Century

DE Kievan Rus'; 10th century; Society; Elite
AB This study is an attempt to present the political organization of Rus' in the 10th century reevaluating the much debated role of the Scandinavians in the formation of the Rus'ian polity. A large number of Scandinavians (mostly from Sweden and Gotland) migrated to Eastern Europe in the 9th middle of the 11th centuries. This fact is clear from the historical, linguistic and archeological evidence accumulated to date. However, much is unclear about the results and significance of this migration. Particularly controversial is the question if and how it came to be related with the formation of the political structures of Rus' which united a variety of peoples (gentes) in Eastern Europe in the 10th 11th centuries. In this paper I examine the elite of Kievan Rus' in the middle of the 10th century. The original sources from that time give us some valuable information on the political organization and social hierarchy of Rus'. Two of these sources are of particular importance: the treaty of 944 between Rus' and Byzantium (a copy is included in the Tale of Bygone Years) and the description of the embassy of Olga, princess of Rus', to Constantinople in 957 given by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus in his treatise De Ceremoniis (II, 15). In my opinion there is some corresponding evidence on Rus' in these two texts which has not been noticed or articulated in the debates on the texts. Emphasizing these correspondences and referring to the witnesses of other sources I attempt a consistent description of the elite of Kievan Rus'. I conclude that the Rus' of the middle of the 10th century was, politically and territorially, an association of 25 non-tribal administrative units located mostly along the famous "Route from the Varangians to the Greeks". These units or most of them were headed by Scandinavian leaders who formally recognized a superiority of the Kievan prince. This model disagrees sharply with the picture created by the Rus'ian chronicles of the 11th - early 12th centuries which exalt the Rurikid dynasty and do not mention in their narratives any other competing leaders or clans. My study aims at verifying this picture and considering a contribution of the Scandinavians to political developments in medieval Rus'.

AB The current political situation in the world is becoming increasingly turbulent, which does not give an unambiguous answer to the question of the future architecture of global governance, the balance of power and the role of international forums such as the BRICS grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - the prospects of which now seem highly controversial. As president of the BRICS in 2015, Russia did its best to promote dialogue at all levels of the BRICS, especially by increasing the number of formats and meetings within the main and outreach tracks. The BRICS Economic Partnership Strategy, which was adopted at the Ufa Summit, confirmed the consolidated positions on major financial and economic issues and on the general principles for relations between the subjects of world politics and specific development issues. Important steps were taken to develop cooperation within the BRICS in energy, science, technology, innovation and other areas. Relevant documents, declarations and action plans were prepared throughout the presidency. Several inaugural BRICS events were held, such as youth, global university and civil summits, creating a civil society component that definitely strengthened the BRICS. As a result of Russia's presidency, the group has shown interest in further consolidation and development: the more complex the situation in a member, the more it is interested in mutual support and common positions in the existing system of global governance. Although the Ufa Summit demonstrated unity among the members and their intentions to cooperate on the agenda, many meetings and consultations revealed systemic divergences. The economic crisis in several countries narrowed the opportunities for cooperation and highlighted the existing political contradictions. Nonetheless, as a powerful mechanism for positioning these large economic actors outside the interests of the Group of Seven, the external representation of the BRICS is most efficient when the countries consolidate their positions in the Group of 20 or other international organizations and communities. BRICS positions have become very noticeable in such instances. However, the BRICS countries have not yet reached an adequate level of cooperating and promoting their interests in the United Nations, which could be considered one trouble spot for the group.
   This article presents a comprehensive analysis of various factors affecting the ongoing formation and development of the BRICS, and offers possible formats for its institutionalization, expansion with new members, and options for competing with the new structures of economic growth and regional trade and economic unions. It concludes that the BRICS should remain a strategic priority for Russia.

Basing on the analysis of the latest (2010-2015) foreign and russian scientific publications, authors suggest the analysis of the Biobank as a heterogeneous object included in both the scientific and the technological, economic, social, psychological and political practices. We identify the main lines of development and risks of biobanking and demonstrate the necessity of experts in the field of applied ethics and social sciences for biobanks' work and development.

DT Article
DE European Union; crisis; The Republic of Poland; constitutional state;
   politic system; populism
AB The author studies one of the key milestones in the history of European Union, which took place during its transformation as a continental structure amidst a crisis, on the example of the complex, retrograde processes in Poland - the leading country of Central and Eastern Europe. It was in Poland where the 4th global democratization wave of 1989-1994 emerged, setting 34 countries on the path of democracy. In 2004, Poland, as a constitutional democracy with a multiparty political system and established civil society, with a new quality of self-organization of society, which experienced the most radical and profound transformation of its political system, joined the EU. It is shown how as the political process was characterized by alternating from waves of democratization to its counter waves (due to world crises) - the process of European integration changed accordingly. Not only was the contractual framework of the economic and trade bloc deepening, but also the political networking in Europe was becoming more complex and multifaceted. The modem stage is characterized by another rollback in social and political development after the right-wing radicals came to power, widely exploiting populist political tactics. The article elaborates these tactics, as well as the strategy of the new right-wing leaders that seek to establish themselves in power by all means. They also seek to reduce the country's political regime dependence on the EU law, to review the current state of affairs when most of the country's sovereignty lies within the EU, along with the control over its legal system, social and political processes. These initiatives of the Polish authorities are aimed at review of the EU principles, as well as development of a new Constitutional Treaty that would legitimize the political principles promoted by the new Polish authorities and strengthen the authoritarian and autocratic trend in Polish politics.

DE Yaroslav the Wise; historical memory; historical consciousness
AB Although nowadays Ukrainians, Russians, Rusins, and Belarusians have different national self-identification, the memory about Yaroslav the Wise is what unites the East Slavic heirs of "Yaroslav's Rus". The article retraces the formation of the basic narratives about Prince Yaroslav the Wise in Russian public opinion and historical consciousness. The authors have brought out the sources that influenced the formation of Prince Yaroslav's image and shown his position in the Russian collective memory among other national leaders. This objective required the analysis of the most mass sources of memory formation referring to Yaroslav the Wise, including educational texts, fiction, periodicals, essays, films, monumental sculpture, and special historical researches. The article shows how the social and political mandate influenced the formation of public opinion about Prince Yaroslav and gives the analytical forecast concerning the prospects for the further construction of the image in the public mind.

AB The author addresses the problem of cross investment as a structural framework of Russian-Indian relations. Mutual investments are considered as a strategic (long-term) factor that activates all subsystems of bilateral relations, including external economic relations, the coordination of foreign-policy lines, and so on. Special attention is drawn to the role of large joint transport projects, which make it possible to intensify investment counterflows and widen the geography of external economic ties. Latent reserves of Russian-Indian trade-economic and scientific-technological (commercialization of intellectual activity) exchanges are identified. Russian-Indian investment relations in the region-region format are considered as the main multiplier of bilateral external economic ties. The passionarity-related function of Russia's eastern regions in the stimulation of Russian-Indian cooperation ties is emphasized, and a preliminary estimation of the investment potential of Russian regions, including Sevastopol and the Crimea, is proposed. The political history of both countries is interpreted as a necessary element of the juncture of cross investments and joint implementation of the "development agenda" by Russia and India.

AB This article draws on a sample of recent legislative elections held in 43 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa in order to empirically estimate and explain the levels of party system nationalisation. The analysis demonstrates that the overall level of party system nationalisation in Africa is relatively low, but in this respect, Africa displays little difference from other developing regions of the eastern hemisphere. Within the set of explanatory variables, an important role is played by ethno-linguistic fractionalisation. However, the explanatory power of this factor is rather limited. A model of party system nationalisation, including electoral system effects, party system fragmentation and political regime characteristics, such as authoritarianism and presidentialism, is proposed and empirically validated. The model demonstrates that while the joint impact of the identified explanatory factors is strong and consistent, none of them can be singled out as the crucial determinant of party system nationalisation in Sub-Saharan Africa.

While standard first-order modal logic is quite powerful, it cannot express some simple patterns of comparative cross-world predication. The starting point of the analysis is the joke about yacht size in Russell's "On denoting". Numeral, objectual, and mentalist interpretations are compared. I then apply the extension of first-order modal logic developed by Wehmeier to allow for cross-world predication in doxastic context. In the conclusion an account of cross-world predication based on two-dimensional account is proposed.

DE Kazakhstan; nation; nation-building; national and ethnical identity;

AB Historically, the Kazakh state was built on the basis of common ethnical identity, as the territorial factor could not be a common ground for nomadic tribes in the classical meaning of nation-building. Both common culture and language played a great role in it as well, but ethnicity was the main force that united people from different groups in one nation. The politicization of ethnical identity existed in Kazakhstani political discourse since the origin of the first Kazakh khanate until recently. It helped people to distinguish themselves from others, such as neighboring tribes in the Middle Ages, the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation later. After the collapse of the USSR, Kazakhstani authorities escalated the use of ethnical identity as a basis for nation-building, emphasizing their symbolic politics to recreate Kazakh symbols and heroes. That aggravated the Russian-Kazakh rivalry and cultural opposition, which resulted in further reshaping of nation-building in order to create the Kazakhstani nation instead of the Kazakh nation. With help of this new approach, Kazakhstan is seen by its leader Nursultan Nazarbaev as a future Eurasian hub which would connect both East and West, and become a leader of the Central Asian region. To achieve this, Kazakhstan needs to be modernized. Under current regime, it is being done in an authoritative manner. Being a subject of nation-building, authorities are trying to use this process as a resource for social modernization. They are attempting to build a nation around the core of the Kazakh culture supposed to use linguistic, cultural and ethnical potential to succeed in international relations. Turning weakness into strength would help Kazakhstan become a regional leader in the relatively near future. However, to achieve this goal, Kazakhstan needs to modernize its social and economic sphere, to make both more democratic, so that minor groups in the country are ensured in their rights and may use their opportunities for their own good and for the benefit of the country. If this happens, we believe that Kazakhstan would have a stable society able to withstand even the change of the country's leader, without escalation of conflicts now suppressed by authorities.

AB The article deals with the prospects for Russia's "pivot to the East" taking into account main chances as well as risks in the context of growing challenges in East Asia. The author stresses that national and regional misbalances in East Asia are the results of the dynamic development of East Asian countries during the last 15 years. "Middle class trap" is at the agenda as the main common problem in China and ASEAN member countries. The analysis focuses also on such issues as broad scaled corruption and state-controlled legal system, quality of political, social institutions and social lifts, role of nationalism and culture. Regional misbalances in infrastructure and R&D as well as the crisis of regional institutions are characterized as new challenges to integration trends in East Asia and Asia-Pacific area in general. According to the author's view, there are three different types of policies to meet the domestic challenges and to overcome "middle-class trap": Japanese, South Korean and Chinese. Prime-Minister Ikeda's "income-doubling plan" accompanied by public activity is described as an effective reform-oriented policy. South Korea's transition from dictatorship to democratic society and more flexible economy is another type of positive reform policy. According to China's modern domestic strategy, a lot of attention is paid to administrative measures against corruption, modification of social policy, reforms of banks, etc. At the same time, public activities and legal system, in spite of some improvements, are still under rigid administrative control. Meanwhile, the role of law will be crucial factor of successful development of East Asian countries at the stage of "middle class economy". To a large scale, the prospects for regional integration depend on growing creative role of China (for example, investments into regional infrastructure and establishment of special bank, initiations of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area). At the same time, China will continue cooperation and dialogue with other countries, first of all with the USA. ASEAN members increase their activity to improve sub-regional cooperation and relations with United States and Japan in order to couterbalance China's influence in East Asia. Finally, the author describes Russia's policy towards East Asia and the Pacific, including brief history, main trends and key priorities at the current stage. "Free Vladivostok port" and some other initiatives to realize more flexible economic strategy towards East Asia and Pacific will give opportunity for Russia to promote its integration into the Pacific Area. Transition of Russia's export structure from resources and energy to innovation goods and services is at the agenda.

AB In recent decades the number of domestic reindeer stock across indigenous communities in the Siberian taiga have fallen dramatically. While this has been viewed as a crisis, this paper discusses how reindeer herders are adjusting their traditional herding strategies to modern conditions. A methodology of contextualization is used to evaluate five reindeer herders' communities situated in different regions of Eastern Siberia. Changes in Siberian reindeer herding are analyzed according to three main types of contexts differing as to the period of their formation: a) traditional contexts that pre-existed the Soviet system, b) contexts formed in the Soviet time; and c) contexts created by post-Soviet reforms. Under modern conditions reindeer stock reduction is important relative to the economic context, but the role of reindeer herding in cultural and political contexts is increasing. The slow formation of "buffer" social contexts makes the taiga reindeer herding communities' condition vulnerable.

AB It is widely accepted that knowledge has always played an important role in the history of humanity, but the value has risen dramatically in the modern world. Consequently, authorities in different countries are facing the issue of improving the competitiveness of the country for integration into the system of world economic relations as a competitive partner and increasing the innovation component in its economic development. The aim of this study was to prove the existence of different levels of national innovation systems: from global to regional. The integral index has been developed that analyses the place of the country in the global innovation system. The results of our future work could be used in decision making process at the governmental level.

DE cities; the European Union; integration; political space; new political
   actors; Europe 2020; Cohesion Policy; the European Neighborhood Policy
AB Local authorities have to deal with a large part of practical work in promotion of the European integration project. Today, cities together with other actors are involved in the EU political process. This involvement leads to modification and enrichment of the European political space and increases the viability of supranational institutions. Cities extend the range of available channels for representation of citizens' interests. Participation of cities in the decision-making improves the quality of these decisions and the legitimacy of supranational institutions, which is especially important in the context of the debate on the democratic deficit in the EU. Cities and other subnational actors can be active at the pan-European level and national levels. They use different "access points" at the European level, such as the Committee of the Regions, the European associations of cities, representations of local authorities in Brussels. The role of cities is especially evident in the Europe 2020 strategy, Cohesion Policy and the European Neighborhood Policy. European cities are involved in the elaboration of national reform programs. Cities and their associations can offer their assessments and visions of development to the Commission. Participating in the elaboration of national reform programs cities get a chance to influence the agenda of national development. This can indirectly affect the implementation of the Europe 2020 and dynamics of the European integration process as a whole. The participation of subnational actors regions and municipalities - is important for realization of the Cohesion Policy objectives. Cities are particularly relevant for this policy, because they can become a ground for social conflicts and unrest. New tools, such as JESSICA and Integrated Territorial Investment, pay significant attention to local level politics in Europe. The European Neighborhood Policy has an important local dimension. There are such city-oriented programs as COMUS, The Covenant of Mayors, CIUDAD and projects of cross-border coordination. Examples show that cooperation between cities is successful, if it is based on the mutual interest in solving common problems. The Treaty of Lisbon has opened new opportunities to cities' participation. European institutions are now obliged to consult with the Committee of Regions on the issues that have a strong effect at the local and regional level. However, the involvement of cities into integration practices of the EU is still limited. This is due to both, the fundamental problem of the EU organizational design, and the lack of effective channels for representing urban interests at the European level.

AB This paper investigates the relationship between political Islam,willingness to migrate and Internet use by exploiting the second (2010-2011) and the third (2012-2014) waves of the Arab Barometer. In an effort to explain individual-level willingness to migrate from the Arab world, it investigates the channel through which the more people support political Islam the less they are willing to migrate. At the same time, it explores the fact that the Internet could potentially act as a vehicle of political Islam. Indeed, our findings indicate that there exists a positive relationship between Internet use and individual-level willingness to migrate, while there exists a negative relationship between political Islam and individual-level willingness to migrate. The findings indicate also that there is no significant effect of Internet use on political Islam.

DT Editorial Material
DE philosophy of science and technology; history; interdisciplinary; social
   criticism; education reform tradition; philosophical community
AB The article shows that Russian philosophical community is very sensitive towards the history and the current state of philosophy of science and of science studies, which are a subject matter of special interest by virtue of a dedicated space in the university education system. This status is also supported by its proximity to the international philosophical mainstream of the 20 th century and its specific object, its connection with science. Philosophy of science at the same time retains some neutrality in relation to the dominant political ideology and proposes claims for an objective knowledge. History of philosophy of science, therefore, serves largely as a history of philosophical rationalism, and its prospects are determined by the strengthening of the role of science in modern culture. However, the modern existence of philosophy of science is undergoing substantial change and experiences a series of challenges. Among them there are the humiliation of intellectuals and scientists in society political voluntarism, mass consumption and the cult of mysticism. Under these conditions, a philosophical study of science and technology is forced to take on the challenges of social criticism and shape special civil institutions for self-preservation. Thus philosophy of science integrates the political, ethical and even social engineering components that allow for treating it as a hard core of interdisciplinary interaction of all socio-humanitarian disciplines.

AB The process of reunification of Crimea and the Russian Federation is considered in the context of the content, the basic trends and contradictions of the modern political process at the global, regional and national government levels. Analyzing the reunification of Crimea with Russia, the authors reveal the problem of observing the principle of sovereign equality of the states, territorial integrity, non-interference into the internal affairs of the states, the right of peoples to self-determination. The authors highlight the geopolitical threats and risks arising from the violation of the principle of force non-use or threat of force in the situation of "Ukrainian crisis".
   This process is analyzed through the prism of the political history of Russia, the establishment and strengthening of its statehood. Interpreted documentary sources reveal the organizational, legal, and political contradictions of the transfer of Crimean region from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1954. Socio-political importance of the reunification of Crimea and the Russian Federation for the present stage of modernization transformations of the society and the state are considered. The possible scenarios of development of the internal political and international situation with regard to the sanctions confrontation of Russia and some foreign countries are analyzed. The authors identified the resources for: effective assertion of the national interests of the Russian Federation; ensuring stability and security of life for all people living on its territory; permanent reproduction of national elite abilities (political, administrative, military, economic, etc.) to act decisively in critical situations, to make fateful decisions of geopolitical nature.
   The article uses the results of sociological surveys of public opinion about the attitude of the Russians and citizens of Ukraine to the process of reunification of Crimea with Russia.

AB The paper analyzes post-revolutionary phase of Russian sociology in the late 1930s converting to a prolonged period of its dormancy. The purpose of the study is to substantiate the point of view of this stage as an unrealized attempt to sovietize sociology in contrast to the established concept of its ban. The post-revolutionary period of sociology is examined in the context of history, that is, in connection with the pre-revolutionary and subsequent ("Khrushchev") stages. The reorganization of sociology and its socio-political environment shows its temporary (until the end of 1950-beginning of 1960-ies) removal from the hull of the Russian social sciences. It is the framework of the project of the early Soviet state scientific construction, the lack of conditions and freedoms, rather than suppression, rendered impossible preservation and further development of sociology.

AB The article presents the author's observation of texts and discourse research methods. Theories, methods and techniques from various scientific disciplines for working with texts and discourses as empirical data are observed, namely traditional methods, content analysis, grounded theory, ethnography, methods based on political psychology, etnomethodology, phenomenology, semiotics, text linguistics, speech acts theory and cognitive linguistics theories, discourse analysis, symbolic politics / policy, methods of sociolinguistics, theory of communication, functional pragmatics, theory of difference, hermeneutics, objective hermeneutics, methods of psycholinguistics, psychosemantics, suggestive linguistics and phonosemantics. A number of types of content analysis, including protocols for the study of leadership from political psychology are discussed in the article. Due to the fact that the subjects of various disciplines within linguistics and related sciences, as well as various methods intercross often, this classification is only one from many possible. The author emphasizes that the Russian political science lacks application of methods observed in the article, even in the cases where they can and should be used, on the contrary to other sciences.

AB Prospects of development of law and state in post-socialist Russia are analyzed in the context of the socialist perspective. The article develops ideas of academican V.S. Nersesyants that socialism has created preconditions for transition to a different social order, providing a new stage in the development of legal principle of formal equality. This potential development was not used in post-socialist Russia. Non-legal nature of privatization of our common socialist legacy has generated a fusion of neo-feudal power and property, not only blocking movement for a just law and legal state, but amounting to return to capitalism. In the current environment, prospects of advancement of Russia in the legal direction are associated with the development of civil society, ensuring real political competition and the legitimization of property by the social contract between main beneficiaries of privatization and the rest of society.

TI SEARCHING FOR THE "NON-ECONOMIC" PRODUCTION

DT Article
DE economic methodology; relationship between the economy and production;
   "Cuvier method"
AB An interesting topic is included in the agenda of the Second Saint-Petersburg Economic Congress (SPEC 2016, March 22) - "Foresight "Russia" : The New Production for The New Economy". Such an ambiguous wording makes it reasonable to turn to great Cuvier's ability to reconstruct a form of extinct animal using a shinbone. Later on, a famous anthropologist Gerasimov demonstrated a talent of the "restaurateur of the history", as he was able to recreate the ancestors' portrait using a fragment of jaw.
   Reincarnation of the method that had been almost forgotten is of increasing importance for the Russian social science, in particular, for economic scientific conferences, essential for a collective search for the truth, -which seems today strange and archaic genre. The author justifies the necessity for the "Cuvier method" as the methodological element of economic research, arguing that its wider implications can provide efficiency of a preliminary scientific assessment, in particular, for the research grants, that are the institutional form for team research. However, its use today is bounded by the methodological culture of practicing economists, in particular, due to their low competence in political economy.
   The author pays special attention to the interdisciplinary character of the "Cuvier method", since its implementation depends on complex approach: analysis of context, historical and subject limitations, conceptual fruitfulness, latent comparative analysis, as well as the assessment of the possibility of an econometric approach. Actually, this refers to projections of the results of a proposed research project (including its specific forms - congress, conference, webinar) according to its key words ("hashtags"), which serve as the "Cuvier's shinbone". The article aims to popularize the method among the professional community of economists.

   middle class; precariat; resource; rents; neopatrimonialism
AB The article is devoted to the analyses of change in determinating factors of modern societies' stratification. Global transformation of competitive market capitalism into rental model immediately affects changes in social structure of society. Reaching the limits of saturation of global markets as a resource repository of capitalism, increase of competition over resources determines the change of predominating mechanism of resource distribution: market is supplanted by directive distribution. Due to transformation of key factors of post-industrial economy contemporary societies face risig challenges to the foundational model of social stratification, based on market-based class aggregation and class relations. It is shown that optimistic attempt to stabilize conventional social structure by co-opting excessive working class (blue collars) into middle class (white collars) that is oriented to employment in service economy predictably failed since technological segments of post-industrial economy need no mass labor occupancy. Due to the lack of alternatives mass wage labor ceases to be income source for increasing number of unwanted people united within precariat concept. Protest activity of precariat can be partially compensated by social state activity: by strategies of gross working time reduction, introducing of basic income not linked to work etc. But this strategy is only possible in the most developed post-industrial countries. In the rest of the world strategies of precariat cooptation into dominating social order by opening access to various rents are economically restricted. It is posited that the new social stratification will be determined mainly not by the exhausted market economy interactions but by political and authoritative opportunities of different groups to get access to resources (capitals, wealth, rents etc.) that are distributed hierarchically. It is prognosticated that this trend will result in increase of alternative authoritative political factors of stratification (estate-based, neopatrimonial, rent-based) distributing the access of social groups to resources. In Russia economic and political power factors lead to hybrid model with market-based stratification which did not succeed to become dominating in post-soviet period is being expelled to periphery by neopatrimonial and rent-estate-based factors of social groups stratification.

AB The paper presents a general description of the phenomenon of the "ethnic renaissance" in Siberia at the threshold of the XX-XXI centuries. The real social, ethnic and cultural programs involved in the ethnic renaissance process are described on the examples of the Autonomous Republics of Altai and Khakassia. The authors conclude that the notion of the ethnic renaissance has been used to denote processes of ethnic and political sovereignization of peoples of the post-Soviet entity (including indigenous peoples of Siberia) and increasing national self-consciousness since the 1990s. The ethnic renaissance models have been based on the concept of "ethnic individuality" that was proposed by national elites. Social and scientific notion of ethnic renaissance in Siberia emerged as an opposition to diffusion of the objective bases of ethnicity (territory, culture and language) in the context of globalization, social-economic integration and cultural unification. It was a reaction to the change of the political system and national policy of Russia in the late XX - early XXI centuries. Depolitization of the social movement for the ethnic revival in Siberia took place in the early XXI century. The process was aimed at revival of national culture, language and education. The category of "cultural heritage" (preservation, research, interpretation and popularization) has become the key topic in elaboration of the future development models of Siberian regions. Ideology and practices of cultural heritage preservation have been based on the concepts proposed by international (UNESCO and UNO), Russian and regional institutions. Laws on revival of ethnic values and institutions and legal acts on preservation and popularization of cultural (including non-material) heritage have been adopted by regional governments throughout Siberia since the 1990s. Regional renaissance programs have been aimed at preservation of historical and cultural landscapes and sacred places as well as regional development on the basis of both traditional and modern technologies. The proposed programs represent a combination of various trends: increasing interest to archaic features and modernism; attempts to reconstruct authentic practices and stylization; cultural heritage sacralization and integration of traditional practices into recreational and commercial local programs. The features of ethnic renaissance in Siberia are ethnic performances at various local festivals, handicraft centers, folklore movements, ecological and ethnological museums. The "ethnic renaissance" of the threshold of the XX - XXI centuries has become the form and method of modernization of the ethnic and poly-ethnic regional communities and their integration in the Russian and global social and cultural entity.

DT Article
DE social justice; interdisciplinarity; theory of justice; social
   regulation; social policy; integration
AB This article is a review of studies from different disciplinary traditions on social justice carried out in post-Soviet Russia. It shows that the concept of social justice is interdisciplinary in nature and that it is considered from different positions within various disciplines: philosophy, political science, sociology, history, legal studies and social psychology. The main issues which are singled out in this analysis are the concept of justice as a regulator of social relations and the issues of social justice from the perspectives of the market economy, law, and inter-ethnic relations. The discussion focuses on the prospects of the philosophical, methodological and interdisciplinary foundations of various theoretical models of social justice, (including the limitations of the ones belonging to the Russian tradition). It also focuses on the issues of market context and reform specificity vs social justice as the basis for integration and harmony, and the challenge of designing new models of social policy. We highlight the temporal change in the character of the related debates-since the 2000s they have become more focused on solving the practical problems of social regulation and on a more dedicated search for conceptual approaches to their solution. Finally, two major dimensions of these studies are distinguished. The first considers social justice as the ideological basis of socio-political regulation, the second treats it as a practical tool of social policy. There is still a gap between them, but at the same time in several social domains (such as law, labour and international relations) there is a tendency towards reaching a rational compromise between them.

AB This article is a response to a number of important issues of the political and socio-economic development of the Russian Empire in the 18-20th centuries, which have been addressed in the fundamental and comprehensive monograph by Boris Mironov, "The Russian Empire: From Tradition to Modernity." Potkina considers such topics as the situation in contemporary national historiography; the theoretical and methodological basis of research; national policy; religious and class discrimination of the country's population; and the characteristics of public administration and its effectiveness. She drew attention to the need to expand the concept of human capital through incorporating issues of the formation of secondary and higher vocational education, which played an important role in providing commercial and industrial firms with certified specialists at the turn of the 20th century. The contribution of Russian entrepreneurs and their hired managers in strengthening links between industry and science is particularly emphasized, and the role of representative organizations of the commercial and industrial class in the development of professional education is revealed. The author also shows the complex interaction between traditional and modern Western culture in Imperial Russia during the period of modernization, their mutual influence and finally, their natural convergence. These processes are demonstrated through examples of the business culture of the Morozov merchant dynasty, the art of lacquered miniatures by Mstiora, Palekh, Kholui, and Fedoskino as well as Russian spiritual and classical music in the 15th to 20th centuries.

AB The article analyzes the possibilities of use of spatial approach in applied and conceptual analysis of ethnopolitical conflicts. The 'spatial' turn in social sciences de facto hasn't yet affected this area of research. But it's obvious that the spatial approach in consideration of its unrealized cognitive potential may be helpful in study of this type of conflicts in multiethnic societies. While constructing multi-dimentional model of political space in studying diversified phenomena of political life and multi-level political process, the researcher can separate ethnic borders, distinctions and distances between individuals and between communities, and thereby reveal and fix an ethnic component of political conflicts, observe and forecast its dynamics. The use of the category of "political identity" and the identification of identity spaces in spatial analysis of ethnopolitical conflicts allow to analyze dynamics of (ethno)territorial communities construction, to study phenomena and process of the politicization of ethnicity and ethnic cleavages, the public policy of formation of competitive and contentious identities in plural societies for assessing the peculiarity of conflict dynamics and degree of its localization, validity of conflicting parties claims over disputable issues and their readiness to compromise. Detecting the degree of leadership and influence of various political actors in the political spaces of different levels in analysis of ethnopolitical conflicts gives a chance of defining and typologizing conflicting parties and participants, estimating degree of the conflict asymmetry and studying the activity of its external participants and their role in conflict dynamics, transformation and management. Using the category of political space the spatial analysis at micro- and macro-level and in diverse measurements - subnational, national, transnational and global, the researcher can detect, explore and appraise degree of influence of external participants of the conflict, which aren't the conflicting parties and whose activities sometimes are kept silent about or intentionally hided.

DE nostalgia; nostalgic consumption; memory; commercialization; Soviet
   Union; memorial policy; sociology of consumption
AB The presented paper focuses on the phenomena of "commercialization of nostalgia" which is defined as the use of Soviet attributes, symbols and artefacts in promotion and branding of contemporary market goods. What can be evident for any observer and what was highlighted by Russian scholars is that Soviet stylistics gain popularity within contemporary gastronomy. Authors make an attempt to answer, why do consumers tend to return to the Soviet heritage and how does "nostalgia proneness" emerges. Process of consumption is socially constructed and could not be reduced to individual acts of purchase, since individual choice depends on institutional context. Evolved as a result of combination of institutional factors, consumer habits turn into "behavioral lock-in". Producers have to adapt consumers needs - it is especially significant for new participants in the established market niche.
   Interdisciplinarity of social sciences makes it possible to operationalize contradictory concepts of memory, past and nostalgia. Gastronomy transfer basic cultural attitudes. Within post-Soviet Russian context it becomes commemorable. By mapping the previous research in the scope of nostalgic consumption as well as conceptualizing the ideas of memory and nostalgia, authors state that the phenomenon should not be reduced to a simple study of the "meanings" and "practices", since these local phenomena are symptoms of broader social and political processes.

DE conscience; cognition; language; thinking; cognitive science
AB On the basis of the comparative analysis of the philosophic concepts of conscience (rationalistic, personalistic, existential, dialectic-materialistical, phenomenological and analytical) and concepts of conscience in cognitive science the paper highlights changes in ontology of cognition conditioned by the progress of the contemporary science in the research of "conscience - cognition - brain" problem. At that, conscience and cognition are characterized as an evolutional ability. This characteristic was given in light of evolutional epistemology. The research of the conscience in the evolutional approach allows explaining the conscience as a new dimension of the structural coherence of the system and environment. Language and self-conscience appeared as such a dimension at humans. Conscience and mind is not a sort of substance placed in brain, and not a function that can be attributed exclusively to the brain. Conscience and mind are formed in social interference; that is the source of their dynamics. The essence of the evolutional cognitivism is in the interpretation of brainpower in light of cognitive resources exceeding the individual experience. Human being is the centre wherethrough information flows go from physical world, biological materia, socium and culture. It is displayed that cognitive science on the basis of the system-evolutional approach to conscience analysis allows to overcome contradictions and reveal coherence in various philosophic interpretations of conscience, and thus, convey the discussion of conscience to the new level of conceptualization. In our opinion, cognitive science in the research of "conscience - cognition - brain" problem performs not the reduction of mental to physical, and does not reduce behavioral functions to cognitive processes. Cognitive science creates more complex model of conscience by the integration of natural sciences and humanities. It demonstrates the aspiration to understand the conscience and associated phenomena as language, cognition, freedom, moral not only by the research of culture and sociality, but by using natural science arguments.

AB The article is devoted to the little known aspect of the history of Tomsk regional museum of local history studies during his formative years. It reveals the leading role of M.B. Shatilov as the creator of the Museum. It is underlined that Mikhail Bonifatievitch Shatilov was known as political activist, publicist, and investigator on ethnography. However, there is not enough knowledge of Shatilov' museum science. Now we know that Shatilov had good contacts with G.N. Potanin, who had worked in many Siberian museums, and had a good experience in Museum works. Under the influence of Potanin Shatilov formed his ideas about museums as public and science institutions. As the head of Tomsk regional museum, M.B. Shatilov was able to realize museological ideas.
   The article shows that Shatilov could fulfil all kinds of Museum work. He was involved in a fund work, held large expeditions on the Tomsk province / okrug. He delivered good ethnographic, archaeological materials, and they still represent one of the great value of Tomsk Museum. M.B. Shatilov added written sources to Museum, so he laid the foundations of the Museum archive. Shatilov arranged with Central Russian museums about gifts. Paintings, vases and other objects were delivered from Hermitage Museum, Porcelain Museum, and Tretyakov Gallery in Tomsk Museum. It should be note that M.B. Shatilov participated in processing of incoming collections; he compiled record cards of museum objects by himself.
   We can say that the main Shatilov' contribution to the formation of Tomsk Museum was his working out of the exhibition. The making of art department had the great importance in the museum exhibition; it was used ensemble method of exposure. There were presented home interiors of Tomsk gold manufacturer Astashev (as it is known, the Museum occupies Astashev' house). The arrangement of paintings reflected the artistic trends; they included the works of European artists, Russian futurists, as well as Tomsk authors. The exhibit, created by M.B. Shatilov, was based on original sources and was very interesting.
   An important role in the organization of Tomsk regional Museum belonged to publishing. M.B. Shatilov produced and published four volumes named as Proceedings of Tomsk regional Museum. These books contain good articles on the history of the Museum, and on specific kinds of Museum work. They can be seen as crucial evidence about works of M.B. Shatilov who needed short time to create one of the largest Siberian Museum.

DE information; communication; anomie; information anomie
AB The concepts of anomie, which form the multilateral mosaic of theoretical explanations and interpretations of the phenomenon of anomie in sociology, describe a particular form of anomie in narrowly outlined area of society. In the domain of sociology, there is uncertainty about the source of the emergence of the phenomenon of anomie. In general, all the concepts are aimed to determine the causes of the origin of certain forms of anomie (social, personal, etc.), analyze and describe the concrete manifestations (impaired social interaction), explain the social consequences, measure the level of anomie in a particular society at a particular time, typify anomie-prone individuals. But none of the concepts has the source mentioned. The author puts forward the idea that the source of any form of anomie is to be found in the communication pathway. As a criterion for distinguishing between approaches, the author proposes to consider both quantitative and qualitative response to the information coming through the channels of communication. Essential concepts in this framework of analysis are then the `weight of anomie' and the 'vector of anomie'. By the `weight of anomie' the author understands quantitative measure of the reaction in the society for the destruction of patterns of stable rules and regulations. It is the size and strength of anomie coverage of all structural elements of society. By the "vector of anomie" the author proposes to realize a qualitative measure of the reaction of individuals on the "challenges" and changes of the rules and regulations in society. The heuristic potential for the expansion of the concept of anomie according to author is laid in the works of modern sociologists, but it is not "tied" to the phenomenon of anomie. The works have an inexhaustible potential for the definition of new forms of anomie are referred by the author a meta-group. The common basis for the metagroup definition, according to the author, is the fact that the basic concepts of sociology, which are taken as a starting point, are subject to decomposition and are difficult to predict whether in the future they will receive the status of the norm or will be critically re-analyzed and rejected by the sociological community. As new forms of anomie the author describes the followings: anomie of theory, anomie of discourse, and information anomie. The author puts forward the thesis: a continuous process of production of information distortion becomes an inherent part of the communication, all communication participants produce distortion of information, and anomie of information is a product of the information society.

TI ARGUMENT AGAINST CONSTITUTIVE PANPSYCHISM

DE constitutive panpsychism; panprotopsychism; conceivability argument; the
   problem of mental causation
AB The argument that I'm going to represent tries to refute panpsychism not tending to criticize the principles of Chalmers' philosophy; it's derived from the truth of these principles. It's primarily based on the article "Panpsychism and Panprotopsychism" and on the second chapter of "the Conscious mind", which is regarded as the most crucial non-physical intuitions. Chalmers 'panpsychism rests on several ssumptions: 1. The conceivability argument is sound. 2. The causal argument is sound. 3. Consciousness is causally relevant. The basis of the conceivability argument is a two-dimensional semantics. Another basis of the conceivability argument Is the position that any metaphysical possibility implies logical possibility. The basis for the causal argument is the principle of the causal closure of the physical. The basis for the causal efficacy of consciousness is an attempt to close the "explanatory gap" arising out of the first two arguments. The basis of consciousness in the case of panpsychism is protophenomenal properties. Protophenomenal properties: 1. Run physical functions and are a kind of intrinsic properties. 2. Fully or partially constitute consciousness, as the constitution can transmit the causal relevance from protophenomenal properties to consciousness. 3. They are not phenomenal, as this would lead to the absurd position that the mower or dirty socks have consciousness. So look at these steps: 1. If the "phenomenal feel" is not the primary and the secondary intensions of the term "consciousness" at the same time, then the conceivability argument is false. 2. Consciousness is constituted by special combination of protophenomenal properties. 3. In every possible world replica of this combination implies the existence of consciousness. 4. Hence, the combination of protophenomenal properties is the secondary intension of the term "consciousness". 5. Protophenomenal properties are not phenomenal. 6. Hence, the secondary intension of the term "consciousness" is not "a phenomenal feel". 7. Therefore, the conceivability argument is unsound. As we can see, the concept of constitutive panpsychism leads to the denial of its base. This does not mean the falsity of constitutive panpsychism, but nevertheless constitutive panpsychism needs deep metaphysical clarifications.

DT Article
AB On the eve of the World War I, members of the Russian right deeply differed in their visions of the status quo and the means of its proper reconstruction. The war further differentiated the Right. The rightists, regardless of the ideological nuances, perceived the war as a chance for political revival. The outburst of patriotism in July and August 1914 became the most serious argument in favor of political reform. Their opponents, on the contrary, saw in it a chance to get rid of democratic institutions and practices. While the more moderate rightists leaned towards consensus, with liberals looking at political dialogue as the most effective instrument for securing social stability, the extreme ones concluded that strict control from above was a more adequate instrument for achieving this goal. All this aggravated the pre-war conflicts within the Right and led to its disintegration on the eve of the Revolution of 1917.

ID FAIR-USE
AB This essay presents the overview and analysis of the discussion between Robert Nozick and John Rawls that is stated in the article "Is Nozick Kicking Rawls's Ass? Intellectual Property and Social Justice" written by Anupan Chander and Madhavi Sunder, American intellectual property law scholars. The translation of these articles is published in the present number. Is the libertarian vision of Nozick in ascendance in intellectual property, overshadowing Rawls's egalitarianism? Yes, and rightly so, some intellectual property scholars suggest. They argue that intellectual property law seeks to solve a fundamental problem of information economics: without intellectual property protections, the ready duplicability of information undermines incentives to create information. Armed with this economic insight and fortified a neo-liberal faith that markets with well-defined property rights in information will best promote liberty, these scholars would keep intellectual property's focus single-minded: to incentivize the production of information. The authors argue that this view is too narrow. A variety of societal goals must inform intellectual property law because (1) understanding intellectual property's impact on a variety of social values helps us restrain maximalist intellectual property demands; (2) relying on the tax and welfare systems to remedy any resulting distributional deficiencies is unrealistic; (3) the reason for existence of Western intellectual property laws is not necessarily globally scalable because of varying capacities to innovate; (4) we must attend to the kind of innovation that law spurs (for example, does the existing regime adequately incentivize the discovery of treatments for poor people's diseases?); and (5) we can best understand fair use doctrine not just as market failure but as an important component of free speech.

AB The rhetorical turn phenomenon is associated with a new understanding of classical rhetoric, which raised in the second half of XX century - neo-sophistic rhetoric. The term because of its ambiguity is difficult to understand, and gives rise to controversy and debate among the proponents of different philosophical fields. This situation is illustrated by the discussion of the term "Third sophistic" between V. Vitanza and A. Quiroga. In fact, this debate demonstrates the difference between two approaches in the methodology of the history of philosophy: contextualist and appropriationist approaches. This paper examines the basic principles, specific to each of these two approaches. Appropriationist approach often receives negative feedback due to its intense modernization the ideas of the past. The paper gives some reasons for the point, that the most appropriate methodology for a correct historico-philosophical analysis of neo-sophistic rhetoric and the rhetorical turn bounded with it is appropriationist approach because of it gives the most accurate relation between the ideas, concepts and arguments of the past and present.

DE letters to power; political adaptation; political daily; Siberia; New
   Economic Policy
AB The article considers letters of the New Economic Policy period, addressed by Siberians to different power authorities from party cells to the Central Committee of RCP(b)-AUCP(b) and the USSR Sovnarkom. Most of letters have information about people's attitude toward power, about the degree of their involvement in the political process, political views and values. In the beginning of the 1920s, one of the biggest problems for most of the Siberian population was the problem of political self-identification. The major part of applications for membership in RCP(b) or for withdrawal from RCP(b) showed the application authors' loyalty and devotion to the regime. At the same time, letters with criticism were an example that membership in the ruling party did not guarantee political adaptation. Both RCP(b) members and non-party people resented the sharp change in policy and the roistering of the local authorities. In the documents of 1923-1925, attention was paid to social, material and domestic problems. Intellectuals, philistines, wealthy farmers asked the power to return their nationalized property, to provide financial support when they felt changes in policy. In the second half of the 1920s, the situation changed again. The practice of deprivation of electoral rights, the dissolution of NEP caused complaints. Totally, letters became evidence of political maladjustment not only of individuals, but also of social groups. However, the authority of the supreme power remained high enough. Young people who grew under the influence of Soviet propaganda sincerely believed in the correctness of the Soviet regime. Their letters showed that this population could easily adapt to the changing policy. What is more, soon young people were to be loyal supporters of the Stalinist regime. Generally, letters of the NEP years from Siberians to the power show two different trends: successful integration in the Soviet system of one part of the population and rapid maladjustment of the other part. It is concluded that the widely used opportunity to appeal to various authorities of public prevented the development of the second trend. It kept the behavior of individuals within the existing rules. Every appeal to power, no matter how critical it was, became a tacit recognition of the authority and legitimacy of the Soviet regime.

AB During last two years there was a raw of interrelated actions in foreign policy like the Ukrainian crisis, strengthening of confrontation between Russia and the West. The tendency to the political isolation of Russia and political fragmentation of the Slavic world has actualized the importance of national branding policy for Russia as the Slavic leader. The article is devoted to an analysis of methodological fundamentals of national brand strategy forming on the identity base. National brand consists of an identity (base), an image (visual embodiment) and a position (communicative positioning model). A communicative branding model should have a basis as a central theme, which has a significant value for the citizens and for the international actors. The search and highlight of the central idea are depending on the most competitive national competences. We think that the Russian national brand identity is defined by the key idea of the strong defensible state. Defense industry traditionally is of considerable importance for Russian society as an guarantee of national safety and one of the most innovative in the Russian industry. So it can be object field for national branding strategy forming. This strategy means an effective using of innovative instruments for the scientific technological advantage reaching and obligatory communication model working-out for the support of innovations in the defense industry. As a result branding communication may become a national unity basis and an effective state positioning. It is very important in the circumstances of global geopolitical instability and armed conflicts close to the Russian Federation state boundaries. Besides an international perception of Russia as the strong state, the Slavic world leader should help a gradual harmonization of the Ukraine political crisis, a normalization of political relations between the Slavic nations and a forming of the united Slavic core at the head of Russia for the developing of the conception of multipolar world in contrast to unipolar one.

AB Foreign policy of Baltic states is examined through the lens of the theory of small states. Key features of foreign policy of the Baltic states are identified. The article analyses key factors corresponding to the choice of foreign policy of small states oriented towards the conflict with major powers. The author predicts the future course of foreign policy of Baltic states and its possible consequences.
   Main criteria of the conflict model are analyzed. Confrontational approaches to politics towards Russia persist. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia aim at disconnecting from common infrastructure with Russia. Economic considerations are being subjected to political aims. The analysis proves the possibility of application of the conflict model concept for the research of several aspects of foreign policy of small states. It deals with tactics of political leadership of a small country which joins a group of states and instigates tensions with its neighbor "state-adversary" aiming at attracting additional resources and raising its status.

   Case description: The rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's laws of inheritance provided Vavilov with a scientific foundation for crop improvement, this foundation was later bolstered by Vavilov's personal drive to conserve plant biodiversity. As he advanced theories and pragmatic approaches for genetic improvement and conservation of plants, political leaders in Russian came to reject Mendel's principles and eventually Vavilov's work.
   Discussion and evaluation: This rejection occurred because Joseph Stalin was desperate for a quick remedy to the famine and suffering from forced collective agriculture. Vavilov's work continued, modernizing Russian crop research while inspiring other scientists to save seeds stored in the world's first gene bank. Three themes illustrating the nature of science help examine Vavilov's life: explaining natural phenomena, uncompromising human endeavor, and revising scientific knowledge.
   Conclusions: The case study concludes with four questions to stimulate student inquiry and self-guided research. They also deepen student understanding of Vavilov's personal sacrifices to ensure use and conservation of plant biodiversity.

AB On 23 June 2016 the majority of the UK population voted to leave the European Union. New British government will need to activate Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on the mechanism of leaving the Union. That will launch negotiations on a new framework of the EU-UK cooperation. Brexit impairs both sides. The UK above all has to minimize economic losses while the EU has to diminish political damage. Britain is interested in keeping full access to the EU Single market but at the same time in restricting free movement. The analysis of the existing formats of cooperation alternative to membership gives evidence to claim that it will be impossible to handle the situation without principle concessions on the part of the EU. Brexit has already incurred damage to the EU reputation and has put forward a question about limits of integration. There are two possible scenarios: more flexible EU structure or further consolidation among member states. Taking into account political and economic challenges, the second option seems more likely.

   ideologies; elections; crisis of social democracy; political radicalism;
   political instability
AB Nowadays, one can see the multiplying manifestations of a crisis of the party system that have been characteristic for the countries of Western Europe. They point at the beginning of its restructuring already the second in the post-war period. In the first post-war period continental Western Europe was featured by a multiplicity of parties that seriously diverged in their ideologies and were placed along the axis "right-left". In the subsequent decades (finally - by the end of XXth century) a bipartisan (or two coalition) system formed that isolated the marginalized radical flanks from the power. Center-right and center - left governments succeeded each other. Right governments were primarily concerned by provision of free economic development, while the center-left ones to a great extent contributed to the emergence of welfare state. The social base of these governments was be the substantially grown middle class. However, at the beginning of XXIth century the two-party system underwent erosion. Its manifestation included the crisis of left centrism and the consequent weakening of socialist and social-democratic parties. This stemmed from the transition to the post-industrial economy, decrease of the middle-class, crisis of the welfare state, and the dominance of neoliberalism. Also importantly, the political topics not connected tightly with opposition along the axis "right-left" (regionalism, ecology, Euroscepticism, other culture immigration) came to the forefront. Finally, the role of parties as a channel for interaction between society and state weakened while requests for increased political representation methods and application of various forms of direct democracy strengthened. Other (new) parties, parties-movements, "parties-antiparties" came forward at the political arena. The attempts to offer solutions of new issues on the ways of political radicalism intensified. The new party configuration hampers formation and operation of governments as the dominant parties receive only a relative majority at the elections. The eventual outcome of this restructuring is uncertain, but a return to bipartisanship is improbable. Most likely, the new - third in the post-war period - party system will be featured by fragility, multiplicity of parties, non-rigid binding of them to the axis "right-left", existence of other political axes, variety and vagueness of the parties' forms. It is probable that the bipartisan centrist governments (like the present government of A. Merkel) will become more or less constant phenomenon. Some currently radical parties will turn more moderate and in difficult cases the non-partisan, technocratic cabinets (like Monty government in Italy) will be formed.

AB At the onset of the mass protests in 2010-2011, many politicians and experts suggested that Arab countries could learn from the experiences of the post-communist transition of the early 1990s. However, the geopolitical, historical, and socio-economic context of the Arab transition was different in many respects from that of the former Soviet bloc countries 20 years earlier. These differences became even more obvious five years later, in early 2016, when most Arab transition attempts ended either in a new wave of authoritarianism, or protracted bloody conflicts. Nonetheless, there are some common lessons to be learnt from the history of both transitions. They concern interrelations between the political and economic transition, the role of institutional checks and balances and the rule of law, the speed of reforms, the dangers of ethnic and sectarian conflicts, and the role of external support.

DE K. Popper; objective cognition; subjective cognition; transmutations;
   interpretation
AB The article studies the problem of pluralistic background of objective cognition by K. Popper. The initial point of this analysis is K. Popper's example. While watching the Shakespeare's play "Hamlet " the philosopher used this sample in one of his public lectures "Cognition : objective and subjective" as an illustration of the physical world as physical thing. This was the reason why the play, being belonged to the world 1, was refused to be performed. K. Popper grounded not the identity of the play and it's various variants of understanding by means of analysis of objective/subjective cognition. Meanwhile it should be emphasised that the topic of objective and subjective cognition link having a millennia hystory, within the last ten years gained new aspects and got new impulse for the development and discussion. These new aspects of vision facilitated in many ways the development of various epistemological concepts, directed to the elicitation of the role and importance of such a notion as reference. The problem of the world objectivness 3 or the problem of interpretative plurality in semiotic gained the following solution. The play and it's performance and understanding, as well as a picture and its reproduction, have parasinonimical relations, which are united by means of sence. The process of transition itself is considered to be a transmutation, determined by the changes of matter epitome of the sence field. Within this approach "death" of the text /theory as objective cognition (world 3) is impossible. But there exist transmutations, which cause the appearance of world 3'1', world 3'2', world 3'n+1'.

DE ethnicity; ethnic policy; identity; Pomor movement; Pomor'e; Pomors; the
   Russian North
AB Although the European North of Russia is a multicultural region, it is often referred to as a single cultural region. For many centuries there have been common names for this region. Of particular importance were Pomor'e and Russian North. The former term is historical, and the latter is related to a cultural project that emerged in the late nineteenth century. In the 1920s both terms ceased to be widely used, appearing only in academic literature. However, in the early 1990s the term Pomor'e regained some of its earlier prominence and acquired both cultural and political meanings. The revival of the term has led to processes of re-identification, because the long forgotten Pomor identity also started to reemerge. However, the regional authorities considered the revival of Pomor identity and the Pomor movement as a striving for separatism, and a fight with and oppression of the Pomor movement followed. One symbolic element of the struggle was an attempt to counterpose the terms Pomor'e and Russian North and to add a political meaning to the latter.

DE technical knowledge; epistemology of technology; taxonomy of technical
   knowledge; double demarcation problem; epistemological emancipation of
   technical knowledge
AB In this article it has been shown that consideration of technique out of value judgement has to be the condition of why analytical philosophy is possible. Continental tradition is characterized by the revealing of social, humanistic and anthropological aspects of interaction between human being and technology, whereas the analytical approach is based on epistemological and praxeological studies. Technical knowledge is determined in frames of the functional approach, as the knowledge that allows obtaining the planned result. Various types and forms of such knowledge may have containing and structural specificity, but knowledge becomes technical only if there's a possibility for humans to obtain the intended result with its help. In this article the problem of double demarcation is considered as separating of technical knowledge from scientific and nonscientific. In this case, the main feature of solution of the demarcation problem is related to the specific of technical knowledge, which may exist in various forms - from based on experience and scientifically unjustified recipes and rules to rigorous technical theories. Separation of non-scientific technical knowledge from non-scientific non-technical knowledge is based on the criteria of efficiency and utility. The term "non-scientific technical knowledge" means here all methods, techniques, recipes and practices, which, from one hand, satisfy the condition of efficiency and utility. From other hand, they let us obtain the intended result, if conditions of their use are satisfied, but at the same time, while being used, they don't appear as conclusions or corollaries of any present technical or scientific theory. Separation of scientific technical knowledge from scientific non-technical knowledge is based on pragmatic criterion. Deductive method of knowledge organization in complex here means the particularity of scientific technical knowledge, in addition to general technical requirements of functionality and efficiency. For all that, scientific technical knowledge may be part both of the technical and scientific theories (such as method of radiocarbon dating), which, however, corresponds to the deductive criterion.

AB This article includes the main social theories of property rights. The question about the existence and development of property right institution is discussed from three perspectives: economic, sociological, and interdisciplinary. Special attention is given to a new institutional school with D. North as a head. In the 21st century, a wave of sociological and anthropological critics showed that institutional scholars' views of property rights were not relevant, which caused an interdisciplinary turn. It was not easy for sociologists to prove their interest in property rights. While political economists were interested in the state's role in property protection, new institutional economists focused on the institutionalization of property, and social anthropologists researched cultural roots in property relations. Finally, liberal economists' normative and ideal views of property rights were weakened. Sociologists argue that property is not restricted to economic sphere, that it depends on and influences culture and law, state and society, collective and individual. The list of property types was enlarged due to recent sociological studies. For example, the female body and trademark were both discussed in terms of property. The first part of the article reviews notions of "property" and "property rights" and a deconstruction of "property" by sociologists. The second part deals with the state's role in the development of private property and the problem of property protection, discussed within the framework of new institutionalism. Then the article examines economic and sociological concepts, which explain why culture matters for property relations, and the article describes the diversity of property relations in practice. Finally, ways of protecting property rights under the institutional instability are analyzed.

The author compares the "classical" and electronic frontier by comparing their basic elements: the main actors and institutions. Stages of formation of the electronic frontier are defined. The author concludes that the use of the frontier metaphor is limited. Notwithstanding this the metaphor can be very useful in studying of contemporary socio-economic, political and cultural processes taking place in the broader context of changing waves of innovation.

DE people with disabilities; accessible environment
AB A level of accessibility of the environment indicates the integration of people with disabilities into the society. Since the UN Convention on the Rights of persons with disabilities was ratified by Russia, building of accessible environment has got a special attention. Currently, this process has being implemented by the federal and regional target programs. Each subject of the Federation develops its own position that is based of an available resources.
   The authors analyzed the level of accessibility of the urban environment in one of the largest Russian cities - Novosibirsk. People with paraplegia who use wheelchairs was selected as a subject of inquiry. This category is faced up to considerable difficulties while moving around the city. Techniques of social mapping of urban space were used as an evaluation methods. City maps are marked with the basic social and cultural institutions that are supposed to be accessible for people with disabilities. However, exact route by which they can get in these institutions were required to be examined. This was the main object of analysis. Arbitrary directions on the main central streets of Novosibirsk has also been studied.
   The study result proved the level of accessibility of the environment in one of the largest cities in Russia is relatively low. And it shows existence of the only certain elements of that kind of environment.
   In general, creation of an accessible environment is far away from being complete. It certainly requires to take into account the views of disabled people themselves.

DE social media; "new media"; communication; notion; interactivity
AB There is rapidly growing impact of new information and communication technologies in the modern society. Different social spheres are felt it's impact. Serious changes have occurred in the sphere of distribution of mass information and in the field of public communication in general under the influence of these technologies. In recent years there have been attempts to give a new designation for the media, which would be taken into account occurring changes in them under the influence of modern ICT. One of such designations is the term "new media". Besides that researchers often use another definitions (for example "social media") with respect to the same phenomena that are implied by "new media". There is an attempt to clarify relatively "new media" and social media in this article. The authors apply the comparative analysis method in order to make it. They use as the main the following criteria: historical, functional, evaluative and socio-political. The introduction into scientific circulation of the notion of "new media" was caused by the rapid computerization and internetization of modern society. The emergence of "new media" is most probably happened in the end of the XX century while social media has long history. The appearance of social media is not connected exclusively with the emergence and spread of the Internet. The authors make a conclusion that the main and original purposes of "new media" and social media differ from one another. If the main purpose of " new media" is immediately information dissemination, the original goal of social media is social communication. The authors mark that apart from social communication and connectivity "new media" facilitate to personal autonomy from society. In the meantime modern social media focused foremost on social communication.

TI IT DID NOT WORK AND WILL NOT WORK? ON THE REASONS OF THE FAILURE OF
   ANTI-MISSILE COOPERATION BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russia; USA; international security; missile defense; ABM; cooperation
AB Joint ballistic missile defense (BMD) means that one party puts saving the lives of millions of its citizens at the mercy of political commitment and the effectiveness of technical systems of the other. Such interdependence implies nothing but close allied relations, which should cover not only the sphere of missile defense, but the key directions of military and foreign policy. Russia and the United States do not have such a relationship, and in the foreseeable future it is unlikely to emerge. Perhaps, in the past, there was a widely accepted and quite naive belief that by the technical solutions for the integration of certain elements of BMD systems it would be possible to circumvent these fundamental military-political realities of the relations between the two powers. After many attempts to establish BMD cooperation in 2002-2011, it became apparent that the whole idea was premature, and from the point of view of today's realities somewhat utopian. Even a partial integration of some elements of the BMD systems implies common understanding of the origins, characteristics of missile attack risks, and their azimuths. The U.S. openly designs its anti-missile system against Iran, North Korea, and, unofficially, perhaps against China. Russia has never officially recognized the threats to its security from these countries. With regard to the BMD systems, Russia's concern about the U.S./NATO program might be alleviated, among other things, by agreeing on confidence-building measures. Such agreements and defense programs adjustments would create preconditions for cooperation in some BMD elements, and later, for the integration of Russia's and the U.S. defense systems as a whole. However, the revival of cooperative anti-missile elements and systems involves much more. It implies a deep revision of relations between Russia and the United States and its allies, which requires significant changes in the foreign and security policies of both parties. All of this goes far beyond relations between Moscow and Washington in the sphere of anti-missile defense - as important and complex as it is. And this problem of higher order, undoubtedly, is much more important for the future of Russia and of the rest of the world.

DT Article
DE North Caucasus; expert assessment; dynamics of ethno-political crisis;
   conflict scenario; ethno-political and religious spheres
AB The paper is devoted to analysis of the dynamics of ethno-political process in the North Caucasus. Empirical basis of the study are a series of expert interviews carried out in 2014. The results are compared to those of 2006 similar study. The research of 2006 was used as starting point to elaborate regional conflict scenarios. The first scenario was "temperately negative" and lasted up to 2008. In 2008-2009 there was a definite shift towards a completely negative scenario, and according to our previous estimates it should have lasted up to 2014 or further. Regional situation in 2014 changed to the better, and it is argued that the greatest contribution to stabilization of the region was made by security forces. At the same time economic, social and cultural conditions changed too little despite considerable administrative efforts and financial injections. Events in the North Caucasus disappeared from the headlines after Ukrainian crisis, but that does not mean that there has been significant improvement of the situation in the region. It is argued that moderate changes to the better should be assessed cautiously as returning from completely negative to temperately negative scenario. 2014 survey revealed that all the factors that caused aggravation of the situation in 2008-2009 still influence regional processes and thus moderately positive tendencies are labile and reversible. Among those factors corruption, economic conditions and religious radicalization are mentioned as most important. The new factor seen by experts is geopolitical situation. Experts regard deterioration of the relations in ethno-political and religious spheres as probable in the nearest future.

This history is analyzed in the context of the Soviet and world economic science. The specific nature of Soviet economic theory is characterized as well as a special position of IMEMO, in its function of the leading think-tank in the field of world economy and international relations. Two main directions of theoretical work of IMEMO economists are identified: transition from the facts and statistical data towards a revision of dogmatic Marxism, and from Western theories to original ideas and practical recommendations. The connection of the theory and applied expertise is given a special attention.

DT Article
DE Russia-U.S. and Russia-EU relations; Russia's image; image; personal

   EU; decision-making
AB The Ukrainian crisis has revealed a fundamental split between Russia and its Western partners, which has in recent years been transforming into a long-term opposition. Two years after the crisis has begun, one can observe a dramatic change in both international contacts and Russia's political image. On the basis of interviews, public speeches and analytical materials, the author of the article describes and classifies the main viewpoints existing within the European and American expert society as concerns the internal political climate in the Russian Federation, its place in the current world order and perspectives of partnership. The article is structured for the reader to see, firstly, how the perception of political image can influence personal attitudes, which key factors can be used for these purposes, and secondly, to classify experts according to their stance on the origins of the Russia-West crisis. Among political-psychological factors the author highlights: stereotypes, images of distinguished personalities, belief system, bounded rationality, personal perceptions, focus of attention, emotions. The main parameters of expert society classification include: career line, party affiliation, nationality, Cold War experience, education and the main research topic (if an expert is a professional Sovietologist/Russianist), personal attitude to the object (Russia). All experts mentioned in the article are divided in three categories. The first one includes the realist-pragmatists -those who do not want to reideologize relations with Russia and tend to seek ways to new normality. The second are the regime change supporters -those who believe that the current Russian political system is the source of crisis. The third are the containment policy revival supporters -those who think that any means, including military, are good to confront the "Russian aggression", which, to their opinion, lies in the core political and psychological basis of the Russia's nature as a successor of the USSR and the Russian Empire. Today, foreign experts are more interested in Moscow's ambitions at large than in dynamics of the Ukrainian crisis, which dramatically harms relations between Russia and the West. The course on isolation in the long run is much more dangerous than it seems to be, as it impedes a global coordination of joint projects between Russia, the European Union and the United States. Track II diplomacy is a very efficient tool to normalize mutual relations, especially when there is little political will on every side.

The system was initially developed in 2013 to analyse petitioning and voting dynamics of the Russian e-petitions portal - the Russian Public Initiative - and then was further expanded. In the paper the architecture and working principles of the system are described. It is argued and exemplified that the data collected automatically from e-petition portals can be used to advance research in several areas: media and PR effects on political participation, issue salience, as well as factors of voting behavior and online political engagement.

TI ON THE QUESTION OF CONTINUITY OF IDEAS OF JEAN BODIN IN A TREATISE BY
   DEGORY WHEARE
SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE national history; absolutism; antiquarian; sovereignty
AB The aim of the article is to identify the mechanisms by which the political situation of different countries formed the historiography of early modern times. In particular, the article attempts to show how the political debate influenced the concept of history of Degory Whear. The article presents a comparative analysis of some subjects raised in the works of French jurist Jean Bodin and English Antiquaries Degori Whear. The main sources of the research are two treatises of Jean Bodin "Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem" (1566) and "Les six livres de la Republique" (1576) and a treatise of Degory Whear "De ratione et methodo legendi historias (The Method and Order for Reading both Civil and Ecclesiastic Histories)" (1623). During the formation of national states in Europe it was especially important to study and analyze historical works. The intellectual contribution to this discussion has made Degory Whear. The treatise " The method and order of reading both civil and ecclesiastical histories" provides a rationale independence history as a discipline that has its own method and using rational ways of knowing. This treatise was written in a period of political instability and the regular discussions on the law. It is interesting to see how it affected the political situation. In this article the author would like to draw attention to two of the subjects, in which Whear gives links to treatises of Bodin. The first subject is related to the Whear's attitude towards the theory of the four monarchies. The second subject contains a recommendation what authors should be addressed during the study of Roman history. Both subjects unite the question of the Roman past and how to represent it. Most likely, the task of these story-lines is the formation of historical memory. During this period, many works appeared in which the authors were aiming to create a national history. Mythological tradition of English authors assumed that the laws of England are more ancient than any of the constitutions and laws of the Roman emperors. Thus, the British national claims were turned into "competition" with the Roman Empire. Processes occurring in the formation of historical science in England and on the continent were similar. Political writers were well aware of that power cannot be stored for a long time without creating and strengthening the powerful symbolic bases of their regime. The above stories are typical for British intellectuals, but the inconsistency of surviving evidence of the past allows everyone to interpret them in their own way. Degory Whear acknowledged the greatness of the Roman Empire. This could be perceived as a symbol of submission to the Roman domination and as a blow to national pride of Englishmen. But Whear's recognition of continuity of the Roman and British "empires" on the one hand, and the establishment of parallels between them, on the other hand, was not an opposition to the official historiography, but rather aimed to contribute to raising the authority of the royal power.

Bell), which do not fully reflect the picture of the society development under the influence of scientific and technical progress. These concepts proceed from the sociological theories, in which the development of a society is based on the social and biospheric nature and is predicated on the natural laws of nature. The society itself, consisting of people, develops on the base of the integration of social, technological and natural processes. It creates the technosphere as a lifeless artificial world with the transition of humanity and biosphere spaces into it. Society, relying on science and machine production, destroys the biosphere and builds a new life, a postbiospheric one. Such a society is not only a technocratic, but also man-caused, as with the loss of soil it will have to produce a biological substance and postbiospheric wild life. The author proves the necessity to move away from technocratic ideas of progress, capitalist development practice by focusing our attention on the socio-economic and political reconstruction of society and the revival of biospheric life, as there are still natural conditions.

DE ethnicity; multi-ethnicity; anthropology; ethnology; Russia
AB Russian ethnology and Western anthropology differ by time of their origin (XVIII and XIX centuries, respectively) and by the main theme: a chief protagonist of Russian ethnography is the particular people, as far as that of Western anthropology is the universal person. Even in USSR, when after the "ethno-boom" of 1920s, the ethnography has been degraded into "subsidiary historical discipline" and pushed to study primordial communism and domestic culture, the ethnographers persistently developed a thematic field of "ethnogenesis and ethnic history." Up to a day the ethnicity remains the leading theme of Russian ethnology marking its practical orientation. In XX century the "national question" was the powerful driver of political and social reforms. Not accidentally, the USSR was created as unit of peoples, and its Supreme Council was consisted of two chambers, Council of Union and Council of Nationalities. As the West relies on multiparty system, the Russia/USSR relies on multiethnic one, and ethnic motives serves as counterbalance to political centrism. In balancing central power and ethnicity a fluctuation can be traced, even statistically: according to censuses, the number of peoples was growing in periods of political crises and decreasing in periods of centralism peaks. For understanding the "anatomy of multi-ethnicity" a method of anthropology of movement seems to be efficient, since it focuses on motives of behaviors and scenarios of interactions of ethnic communities and their leaders, rather than on static pictures. Interior complexity of Russian community, being multifaceted by emergence, provided their bending toward interethnic alliances in a role of intermediary-folk. In analysis of Russians' and other Russia's peoples' relationship a notion of ethno-cenosis (partly borrowed from ecology) could be applied; it designates a complex community, in which peoples and their groups maintain their self-being and specific spatial and functional niches. These groups differ from each other by the experience of eco-social adaptations, strategies of ethnic behavior and ethno-cultural potential. The peoples play their parts in ethno-cenosis depending on distribution, number, solidarity, cultural-economic profile, religious tradition, linguistic behavior and other features. These roles could change and upgrade, but they identify and provide the people's self-being in social environment. For each people ethnically distinguishable behavior in dimensions of kinship, sex, power, language, religion, economy, everyday life, ethics, aesthetics is significant, as well as the mutual adaptation of theses peculiarities is important for multi-ethnic community.

DE New media; media discourse space; professional development; professional
   self-concept; undergraduate and graduate students
AB The mass media of the first decades of the new millennium (the new media), are characterized not only by the paramount informing function, but they are also distinguished by their ability to interact and influence the target audience in both spontaneous and dramatized modes. Simple navigation and a quick and easy access to their content stand behind the increasing popularity of the new media among younger generation.
   Modern new media provide the discourse space where young people, or "the millennials", feel as if they are in the centre of various political, social and economic events; the so-called "Big Brothers" having impact on people's life in the society. Taking into account the facts which are directly connected with the existence of the youth in the media discourse space this paper aims to track and analyze the influence of the new media on the bachelor's and master's students' professional self-concept.
   Our research introduces the working hypothesis that today's media discourse space affects both directly and indirectly on university students, no matter what their future specialization is.
   Our students' survey was conducted in three Russian higher education institutions: Institute of philology and foreign languages, Moscow Pedagogical State University (MPSU, Moscow); Faculty of Science and Technology, Chelyabinsk State Pedagogical University (CSPU, Chelyabinsk); and Ecological faculty, Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (PFUR, Moscow).
   The survey included the responses of the junior and senior bachelor's students as well as the first and the second year master's students. Young respondents were asked to evaluate the degree of the perceived information credibility, a positive and negative impact of present-day social networks on the younger generation and on their professional future; foreign languages and cultural knowledge; the students' ability to interact with a foreign media discourse space, reading and leaving comments about different events in the Russian and foreign new media. Therefore, we established the correlation between the various types of variables which compose the system of the media discourse space and the students' multiple reactions to their comprehension of the new media. The key influencing factors in the course of information exchange between students' world perception and the media world were defined. The main conclusions about the extent of the new media influence (or its absence) on bachelor's and master's students and their professional development were drawn in the research.

DE Ulus of Jochi; natural and climatic features of the Lower Volga region;
   Golden Horde towns; Caspian Sea level; Great Silk Road; longstanding
   drought; wide-spread famine; Black Death
AB The article deals with the natural-climatic and environmental factors in the history of the Golden Horde. From the very beginning of its existence the Jochid Ulus proved to be very dependent on the environment. Its existence as a major military and political formation and an important element of the global economic system directly depended on recreational potential of the Lower Volga steppe biome in the recovery of the steppe's original form. This could worsen the ecological situation both because of the active human impact on the ecology of the region, and as a consequence of climate change. Prudent economic policy of the Horde rulers during the favorable natural and climatic period allowed the Jochid ulus to become in the shortest time the center of attraction in the Black Sea-Caspian region.
   New Horde towns played a major role in this process. They represented mostly the enlarged nomadic camps with few fixed structures. Even after the development of economic and cultural relations along the Silk Road in the late 13th century and the subsequent economic recovery of the ancient urban centers in Central Asia, the Crimean and Bulgar uluses, new Horde towns of the Lower and Middle Volga regions and Western Siberia continued to bear the imprint of the nomadic settlements at a new stage. At the same time, signs of active construction of permanent structures emerged in these towns. Taking into account the urban achievements of eastern countries, these towns gradually became places of attraction for the urban districts and surrounding areas.
   The sharp level change of the Caspian, Azov and Aral Seas began in 1320. Along with an increase in seismic activity and climate instability, this change became a detonator of the catastrophic consequences for the Golden Horde. The epidemic ("Black Death"), demographic (famine) and political-military ("Great zamyatnya") factors represented the Rubicon that the Jochid ulus could not cross. At the same time, remaining Golden Horde towns in the Crimean and Bulgar uluses had been able to become the centers of formation of a new political elite of the post-Horde Tatars.

DT Article
DE civic education; active citizenship; civic competence; politics;
   individual; state; society
AB The article examines topical issues of civic education. The subject of the analysis is a contradiction between specific goal setting of the educational process, on the one hand, and the variety and unpredictability of political life, on the other. This contradiction is particularly pronounced in transitional-inversion types of societies, including Russia. The aim of the article is to study approaches to the construction of a modern model of civic education that provides effective functional and dynamic interaction of the political system and its social environment. The main attention is paid to what theoretical developments may constitute the conceptual framework of a modern model of civic education. The competence approach to civic education is generalized. This approach emphasizes the importance of matching the cognitive, emotional and behavioral components of citizenship, as well as its effective implementation in the relationship of the citizen with the public and political institutions. At the same time the perspective directions of civic education (civic engagement, rational behavior, the balance of interests of the state, society and the individual, et al.) are determined in view of "skills of the 21st century" (leadership, critical thinking, problem solving, individual responsibility, cooperation and curiosity). It is shown that many of these skills can be implemented in different socio-political contexts, as indicated by the examples of historical and today's local and regional expertise. It is concluded that solution of the contradiction between "education and politics" is possible in the framework of a broad approach to the definition of civic education. Civic education includes all processes that affect beliefs, obligations, opportunities and actions of people as members or prospective members of society. This definition implies eclecticism of civic education and reflects the interaction of the different social, cultural and political contexts. It is not so much the ideological content of a particular model of civic education that is important, as the development of knowledge, values, attitudes and skills that enable the individual to coordinate the cognitive, emotional and behavioral components of its relationship to society and the state.

ID INNOVATION
AB The development of a strong economic base in resource-based countries is not trivial. Relatively few such nations have succeeded in the transition to a "resource-based knowledge economy". The national knowledge base should be exploited to improve productivity in old resource-based industries and to develop new industries. These knowledge-based (or so called enabling) sectors themselves developed in interaction with resource-based industries and were often driven by the demand from these industries. This dynamic interaction between natural resource industries and enabling sectors should be regarded as the core aspect of the successful economic development of resources-rich countries. Today, such a historical framework provides a reason to regard these countries as "resource based knowledge economies" that succeeded in establishing the institutional support for social interaction between resource-based firms and actors with "useful knowledge". It is important that this type of linkages is created within a local or national economy. There are specific historical processes underlying the establishment of the "social technologies" of close interaction between resource-based industries and enabling sectors. The case studies indicate there are many forms of institutions that can foster collaboration between resource-based industries and knowledge organizations or enabling sectors. The article especially considers the role of social relations between actors in small local communities and national elites with a shared vision. The sustainable development was also defined by relationships in business chains and by larger companies' ability to incorporate the enabling sectors. The role of knowledge generating and disseminating institutional structure was extremely important. The author addresses to knowledge generating "enabling sectors" and the ability of these sectors to link with resource industries to achieve innovation into new products and industries. The question is why it became possible to establish this type of interaction in some sectors and countries, but proved to be more difficult to achieve in others. This calls for a deeper analysis of the social, political and cultural basis for economic behavior.

AB The article is devoted to the general overview of the creative work of V. I. Lamansky an outstanding Russian Slavonic scholar (1833-1914) and presents the introductory text to the publication of the first part of the series of his works "Historical letters about the relations of the Russian nation to its tribesmen" (1859). The article explicates the important details of the scientist's biography and gives a brief analysis of the essential content of the archive materials published for the first time. V. I. Lamansky had studied the Slavs throughout his scientific career. However, not a series of interesting and separate special investigations typical of modern historians and philologists but the monumental conception of the political and cultural structure of Eurasia divided by Lamansky into three independent worlds, i.e. European (Roman and German), Middle (Greek and Slavic) and Asian, has become the main outcome of his creative searches. Although Lamansky's studies were carried in the quiet of the room and were the result of the scrupulous scientific work, they were oriented towards the understanding of the basic principles of the social life. V. I. Lamansky understood a scientist's work an indispensable element of social being and strived to lead it out into the spear of opinion journalism and free intellectual life. This trait of Lamansky's creative works is already notable in his early series of articles named "Historical letters about the relations of the Russian nation to its tribesmen". The very first "Letter." reflects a number of the most important ideas of Lamansky's theory: the unity of the Slavs on the fundament of the unity of their languages, animosity of the Western - especially German culture towards the Slavs and understanding of language as an expression of the volksgeist. Moreover, it is important to mark that in "Letter.", there is evident influence of the theories which were contemporary to Lamansky and had appeared in Germany on the wave of the Romanticism. This fact primarily concerns the obvious W. von Humboldt's influence which lent the conception of language to this work. The examination of both Lamansky's "Letter." and his whole creative work gives an idea about the level and character of the Slavic studies in Russia throughout the second half of 19th century, allows to realize that deep transformation which has happened to this science since the time when Lamansky worked and affords to understand how its development begins in Russia.

DE innovations; economic development; investment; competitiveness; quality

AB The paper analyzes the issue of implementing innovations in Russia, which constitute one of essential factors in the economic development as they facilitate the transition from a resources-based economy to an innovative model, and contribute to energy efficient, energy- and resource-saving technologies. An innovative economy implies continuous technological improvement as well as production and export of advanced products offering very high added value.
   The study has showed that the innovation-based development leads to the production of goods and services that meet international standards, and requires increased investment. For this reason, it is necessary to determine which investments are influencing the Russian economy and serve as a driver to a more intensive innovation process in the country.
   The authors' conclusion is that the most important signals evidencing Russia's arrival at a new level of innovation may include indicators such as: a high index of economic freedom, a high level of education and science, high quality of life, high cost and quality of human capital, a highly competitive economy, a large proportion of innovative companies (about 60-80%) and innovative products, etc.
   The analysis, carried out in the paper, reveals that an innovative economy is the next economic formation which replaces the industrial economy.

AB The article posits that contemporary Russian political order presents a reality structured by value and institutionally by competitive principles of legitimating. The process of market-based class structuring that started due to decay of soviet estates was suspended until being finished. The space of distributive exchanges, restoring usual for Russian history estate-rental political order, with an authoritative core (center) of society is now rapidly expanding. Thus social structure of Russia today is a peculiar estate-market symbiosis, within which classes are restructured institutionally and normatively by post-soviet estates. Market based interactions and Modern political institutions are displaced to social periphery that shields the rental-estate core in its communication with an outer worlds and thus provides external legitimacy of the system. Nevertheless, in Russian political theory the traditional concepts describing political order with the terms related only to a thin Modern shield are prevailing. They analyze Russian political order through their internal normativity, even admitting its various deviations from prescribed norm, but they ignore Russian societies' rental-estate core inherent specific. Thus alternative approaches sensitive to distributive exchanges and attempting to grasp theoretically and methodologically the specific of rental-estate core seem to be more relevant in analyzing Russian political processes.

AB The metaphysics of domestic reform seems to be the leitmotif of Russian political science. The debate about the direction of the reforms of the last 25 years, about the nature and specifics of transformation of the society and the individual constantly come up in various contexts, the intersection point of which is the identification of relations between political and institutional transformation and the status of Russia as a subject of historical creativity. The goals and results of transformations in the social and individual projections reflect multilayered overlay of civilizational parameters of Russian society, its social canvas, social needs and political strategies. The problem of social stability and variability correlates with the notions of subjects and objects of political and economic reforms, their ideological intentions and the dominant socio-political discourses. The ambiguity of the outcomes of the reforms in Russia implicates research perspective of categorization and understanding of the essential forces of the individual and the society: understanding the social features of Russia, reflection of social needs in the mass consciousness, the political meanings of the reformation and finally the destiny of man.

DE energy efficiency; innovative modernization; technological modes
AB The matter of the Russian economy's transition to an innovative way of development has over many years been given special consideration. The measures undertaken have definitely made a considerable contribution to the innovative activity's development in the Russian economy's various sectors. The process of the national innovative system's goal-seeking formation has been launched because of them. However, a range of problems unresolved still constrain the transition of Russia to a trajectory of sustainable innovative development. In particular, the discussions on choosing certain priorities of development which could set a powerful impetus for innovative modernization of the domestic economy and could facilitate the provision of its competitiveness in the context of formation of the new technological mode are being held up to the present. The place, occupied by technological modes in the national economies' development of different countries has been identified for justification of one's viewpoint on the problem under consideration. The undertaken analysis of the innovative development programs' has indicated that particular emphasis is being placed on the issues of energy saving and energy efficiency enhancement in the documents, elaborated in practically all countries. The article substantiates the thesis, that due to the current structure of the Russian economy with the dominant development of the energy sector, energy efficiency enhancement should be necessarily considered as a top priority that should be of the system nature, embracing the technological modernization's other priorities. It is only the ultimate concentration of the efforts that may boost the creation of competitive energy-efficient technologies, which, along with the nano-, bio-, information and nuclear technologies, should become the basic ones within the framework of the new technological mode of the economy's development.
   In compliance with the results of the study undertaken the proposals on forming the mechanism of energy saving and energy efficiency enhancement intensification, harmonization of legislation at various levels of economic management in the areas of energy saving and innovative activity, revitalization of public-private partnerships in the implementation of the organizational, financial, economic and legal support of priorities in the sphere energy saving and energy efficiency enhancement have been put forward.

SO ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Golden Horde; Bek Bulat; khan Tokhtamysh; Timur; Saray
AB The article is devoted to Bek Bulat - one of the characters in the Golden Horde history of the end of the 14th century and one of the first traitors during the confrontation between khan Tokhtamysh and Aksak Timur. During this period, the Golden Horde again faced political instability. Bek Bulat was the first and foremost among the contenders to the central power. His figure is interesting because at the beginning of his career, he was one of Toktamysh's military commanders and his relative, but later he betrayed his suzerain. His story helps us to understand Edigu and his supporters. For if Bek Bulat would not be destroyed in 1392, possibly it would have been he who would have become the arbiter of fate in the early 15th century.
   Tensions between Tokhtamysh's supporters and opponents were profound. Tokhtamysh proclaimed the revival of the Golden Horde of the times of khans Uzbek and Janibek, but his adversaries opposed Tokhtamysh's policy aimed at centralizing power. They wished to maintain influence of clans in order to prevent beklyaribek and vizier's power to become declarative. To accomplish their goals Tokhtamysh's adversaries tried to use his confrontation with Timur and came into contact with the latter. They betrayed Toktamysh during the decisive battle on Kondurcha in 1391, and later he executed them for this treachery.

The scope of our analysis includes social networks that are most often used by Russian citizens: Vkontakte, Odnoklassniki and Facebook. In the course of the research, there were used methods of content analysis and linguistic analysis. Techniques of semantic and textual analysis were applied to the analysis of certain types of text: titles, slogans, descriptions of groups and user comments. Content analysis method was used to identify the key semantic categories (topics) that are relevant to users of social networks. The analysis of the information placed in groups (communities) in social networks shows a significant difference in understanding of the investigated phenomenon.

AB Migration to Europe from other countries has emerged as one of the hottest and most emotionally perceived political and social problems. The migration crisis of 2015 makes the issue even more acute. Public attitudes towards migrants are shaped by interaction of multiple factors, and are often explained in the literature from two standpoints. These are potential economic competition between migrants and natives, and tentative conflict based on differences between cultures and values. The first corresponds to the realistic conflict theory, while the second is rooted in the social identity theory. This paper explores perception of migrants across the European countries by the European population with regard to both theories. The main data source for the study is the European Social Survey for 2014 that covers 15 countries. The paper exploits two survey questions. One concerns whether migrants pose a threat to native societies and in which domains (jobs, social benefits, cultural values, crime), the other explores how populations of receiving countries see "ideal" migrants and what requirements (good education, language, Christian background, commitment to the way of life) are put forward, so that migrants could be accepted. The European countries vary significantly in perception of migrants. While Scandinavian countries and Germany demonstrate relatively high degree of tolerance, the population of Austria and the Czech Republic show much less friendly attitudes. In all countries, those who are less educated, having lower incomes and weaker labour market positions are likely to consider migrants as potential rivals for jobs and social benefits. However, the major factor shaping the attitude is the expectation that migrants should be committed to values and the life-style of a receiving country. Another key factor is the level of general trust - respondents from societies with high level of trust have more positive perception of migrants.

AB The article based on the author's field materials, scientific literature and media publications on the example of Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug - Yugra studies modern institutions and practices, producing and maintaining ethnic identity of Numerically Small Indigenous peoples living there (Khanty and Mansi). What are the forms and mechanisms of social and cultural differentiation of local communities? How does ethnicity turn into a resource and how is it used? These and other questions are the focus of author. At the end of the 1980s, against the background of the general public and political liberalization in the country, the indigenous peoples of the North were involved in the processes of "ethnic revival", the ideological base of which were the local intellectuals' calls to search for historical roots and to the revitalization of ethnic cultures and traditions. In the case of "ethno recovery" historical and cultural heritage of the indigenous peoples acquired great importance and has become a powerful factor in ethnic mobilization. The study showed that in modern society where consumption becomes a new ideology, indigenous peoples of the North ethnicity begins manifesting itself in a fundamentally new quality - the traditional images and cultural symbols are used as a resource to achieve the economic goals, becoming an integral part of "product", "goods" or "services". Currently the opinion that the ethnic identity of the northerners must first of all be implemented in traditional forms of management adjoins in the public and scientific discourse with understanding that acceptable social existence which is based only on traditional model is impossible. Great role in the "ethnic recovery" is given to Education and Science. The author makes the conclusion that modern Aboriginal adaptation strategies related to ethnicity are determined with public authorities' policy. However, in contrast to the Soviet period, the specific practices of "Ethnoconstruction" in modern Russia are manifestation of the activity of the aborigines themselves, which is at least connected with the international movement of indigenous peoples. The dominance of public broadcasting channels ethnicity suggests that ethnic culture today is reproduced in new forms, mainly through the efforts of professionals.

AB The implications of the Crimea becoming part of the Russian Federation are multifaceted; first of all, they can be seen in the political sphere. In order to legitimize the accession process, the powers of most political actors were mobilized, especially the ones of the institutional and partisan veto players, whose agreement is necessary for a change of the legislative status quo. Necessity to respond rapidly to the Crimean event was the cause of the emergence of political functions of the Council of the State Duma - the internal institutional structure, which used to be responsible only for organizational work of the lower house of the parliament. The subsequent formal confirmation of such functions is the reason to assume that Russia has a new veto-player. To understand the actual role of the Council of the State Duma in the legislative process, the author has analyzed its powers and considered qualitative and quantitative indicators which influence the agenda and legislative initiatives. The results show that the Council of the State Duma is a strong technical structure characterized by political composition and limited political opportunities.

AB The 1917's revolution, which led to sovietization and transformation of the universities' structure, was a great trial not only for the Petrograd University, but for a whole system of high education. The data of this article helps to reveal and analyze the reasons and the character of scientists'emigration, and also to construct their "collective portrait". According to this article, the major part of emigrants were scholars of humanities, being at the heyday of their creative abilities. Henceforth most of them managed to continue their professional career in the West countries. Authors consider that the main reasons for the exodus laid in the political and ideological sphere, but not in the academic or material one. They make a presumption relating the consequences of the mass emigration for the Petrograd (Leningrad) University as well as for the science of those countries which gave refuge to the emigrants.

AB In the early 1990s first Cossack organizations were formed in Russia and the process of Cossack restoration was launched. The role of the government was very important in the organization of the Cossack restoration movement and in forming its bodies. Nevertheless, initially the movement was pushed mostly by aspiration of Cossack descendants, i.e. by primarily social and cultural forces. In the first place those forces searched for a new social identity and the desire to regain the Cossacks' past and, probably, to live it again. The Cossack restoration movement is developing in many regions of Russia. The process is especially rapid in the south of Russia, on the traditional Cossack territories which were part of the Don, Terek, Kuban, and Astrakhan Cossack Hosts in the early 20th century. New Cossack organizations are formed by people of different professions and social status, Cossack organizations grow fast in number which is indicative of demand for Cossack movement in the Russian society. The principal ideas under the Cossack restoration movement are preservation of the Cossack culture and history, rehabilitation of the Cossacks as a politically persecuted people and its ethnic revival, and presentation of the Cossacks as the most patriotic part of the Russian society. These principal ideas vary in details in different Cossack organizations according to the changed social, territorial, and political conditions. Nevertheless, all the above-mentioned factors collectively led to establishing the Cossacks as a new distinct part of the Russian society and contributed to putting the Cossack restoration movement on a long-term basis in the social and political life in Russia.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB Computer simulation, an active learning technique, is now one of the advanced pedagogical technologies. The use of simulation games in the educational process allows students to gain a firsthand understanding of the processes of real life. Public administration, public policy, and political science courses increasingly adopt simulation games in universities worldwide. Besides person-to-person simulation games, there are computer-based simulations in public administration education. Currently in Russia the use of computer-based simulation games in Master of Public Administration (MPA) curricula is quite limited. This paper focuses on computer-based simulation games for students of MPA programs. Our aim was to analyze outcomes of implementing such games in MPA curricula. We have done so by (1) developing three computer-based simulation games about allocating public finances, (2) testing the games in the learning process, and (3) conducting a posttest examination to evaluate the effect of simulation games on students' knowledge of municipal finances. This study was conducted in the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and in the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA) during the period September to December 2015, in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Two groups of students were randomly selected in each university and then randomly allocated either to the experimental or the control group. In control groups (n=12 in HSE, n=13 in RANEPA) students had traditional lectures. In experimental groups (n= 12 in HSE, n= 13 in RANEPA) students played three simulation games apart from traditional lectures. This exploratory research shows that the use of computer-based simulation games in MPA curricula can improve students' outcomes by 38%. In general, the experimental groups had better performance on the posttest examination (figure 2). Students in the HSE experimental group had 27.5% better scores than students in the HSE control group. Students of the RANEPA experimental group had 38.0% better scores than students in the RANEPA control group. Research indicates that lecture-based courses are less effective than courses with more interactive approaches. Therefore, our study highlights the need to implement computer-based simulation games in MPA programs in Russian universities. Computer-based simulation games provide students with practical skills for their future careers.

DT Article
DE nuclear deterrence; security; strategic stability; Ballistic Missiles
   Early Warning System; decision-making; launch-on-warning; human factor;
   ballistic missile defense
AB The central part of the article is devoted to the analysis of a "human factor" in the decision-making process based on the information presented by the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS). Having analyzed well-known cases of the U.S. and Soviet (Russian) BMEWS false alarms, the author comes to a conclusion that the role of a "human factor" in preventing fatal mistakes in decision-making process is most important. At the same time, the very existence of an early warning system has rather negative than positive effect on strategic stability. The author states that without BMEWS, the strategic situation could be probably less predictable, but more stable since in that case it excluded launch-on-warning options for military-political leadership of the two great nuclear powers. The early warning system could be used by a "third power" to provoke a nuclear conflict between Russia and the United States; it can be vulnerable to a cyber-attack, or just initiate a false alarm due to a technical error as it took place before. All this can result in a fatal decision to launch nuclear weapons on warning of such an "attack". The present procedure which includes a "nuclear case" with a "red button" in it not only provides, but also contributes to such an option. The author concludes that the present unstable situation with BMEWS can be improved only by adding ballistic missile defense to the state security system of Russia. It is suggested that Russian authorities reconsider their negative attitude towards ballistic missile defense and start a national-wide program to provide a "thin" defense for the most populated territories of the state. This move could contribute to security by offering the leadership other options in case the BMEWS initiates an alarming signal. As a minimum, there will be the "third" option in comparison with the present choice to order or not to order launching of nuclear weapons on warning.

ID STRUGGLE
AB The article tackles the issue of the interconnectedness of the global economic crisis 2008 to the 'For Fair Elections' movement in Russia in 2011-2012. Recent studies show that the 2008 crisis affected the political attitudes of Russian citizens, who began to assign blame to the government and ruling party. This development might have contributed to the mass mobilization of 20112012 against unfair elections and the 'United Russia' party in particular. To test this hypothesis we examined a dataset covering public protest events over 2008 to 2012 in the regions of Persmkii krai and Tyumen oblast'. The cases in this article were selected due to their similarity along the basic socio-economic indicators and differences in their political features, particularly with regards to their degree of competition and the level of civic engagement. The challenges of event-analysis have been addressed as well; it appears that a focus on the sub-national level helps overcome certain limitations. Despite these limits, the data reveals both the frequency and the level of engagement of citizens in protest activity, while tracking the composition of demands on display. According to this data, the cases of Perm and Tyumen demonstrate divergent dynamics of contention while sharing a similar protest composition: local or urban governance issues are the most frequent closely followed by political and civil rights demands with economic protests lagging behind. The global economic crisis hit both regions badly but did not dominate the public protest agenda. Moreover, contrary to theoretical expectations, contention was more intense in Tyumen rather than in Perm, whose economy was prone to crisis and politics were more conducive for mobilization. This paradox can be explained by Tyumen's highly active communist parties, who, also contributed to the amalgamation of economic and political claims. Umbrella organizations in both cases were identified as another arena where political and civic activists struggled to reconfigure protest demands.

AB The author analyzes the issue of relations between the French revolutionary troops and of the Italian population during the French occupation of Italy between 1796 and 1799. He poses a number of questions, such as: which social groups of the local population collaborated with the occupation army, and which, on the contrary, fought it? What was the motivation of the former and the latter? He seeks answers to these questions, exploring the military campaign of the French army in Southern Italy between 1798 and 1799. Analyzing the French and Italian sources, the author concludes that the French invasion of the Kingdom of Naples a caused deep split in Neapolitan society, which was produced by the conflict of opposing value paradigms. A part of the local elite, whose worldview was formed by the cosmopolitan culture of the European Enlightenment, treated the French troops as an army of "Soldiers of Freedom". This social stratum was eager not only to welcome the foreign invaders but also to support them with arms against its own countrymen. On the contrary, Neapolitan peasants and plebs, the real partisans of traditional culture, treated the invasion of the French as a mortal danger to its values, especially to the Catholic religion. That is why the "lower" Neapolitan society showed fierce resistance to the foreign invasion. These social divisions had far-reaching implications, providing a long-term impact on Italy's future political life, affecting Italian historiography to date.

DE Hegel; Walter Benjamin; Owl of Minerva; Angel of History; happiness;
   revolution; dialectics
AB In Hegel's philosophical system, the owl of Minerva is not just a metaphor, but a significant symbol. In the symbolism of Hegel's time, it stood for ideas of enlightenment and political emancipation, including radical, revolutionary, cosmopolitan, anti-monarchical, and even anarchistic ideas. Hegel, however, places the owl in a context that appears utterly un-revolutionary. "The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of dusk," he writes in the preface to the Philosophy of Right, thus summing up his argument that philosophy's task is not to teach the world how it ought to be, nor to issue instructions to the state, but rather to comprehend the world as reasonable.
   Not only does Hegel's owl seem to defend the reactionary present state ( a state against which she previously fought in the name of reason and freedom), but she also seems to teach us to accept the present with joy. The point is not merely to reconcile oneself with reality, but also to enjoy it. This paper traces a number of explanatory trajectories-philosophical, psychological, and anthropological-in order to elucidate the paradoxical nature of this enjoyment, and compares the figure of Minerva's owl with another flying creature, Walter Benjamin's Angel of History. Such a comparison aims to pave the way towards a new interpretation of Hegel's philosophy of history and time.

AB Currently, the problem of efficient gathering and analysis of heterogeneous data from public Internet sources is relevant to many companies working with social issues. Also it applies to the task of building a social profile for the subsequent person identification. This paper addresses the issues of direct and indirect identification a person on the Internet as well as data structure development to store the static and dynamic information of a personal social profile. The article considers the basic options of personal network identification such as an identification by profiling data, IDs, personal websites and blogs, accounts in social networks, e-mail addresses and links from other resources. After identifying it is necessary to collect and structure the detected data about a person. For this purpose, the authors proposed a basic data structure divided into static and dynamic parts. The static part is represented in the form of a relational database and contains immutable data that uniquely identify a specific human (for example, name and surname, completed educational institutions, career, curriculum vitae etc.). The dynamic part is organized as a NoSQL store and accumulates all the information about the current human activity in the network (for examples, accounts in social networks, network friends, current preferences when buying products, preferences when visiting network resources, political and social beliefs etc.).

AB History of concepts has influenced several political science disciplines: political philosophy, political theory, political history, history of social and political thought, even political analysis. Despite considerable interest of Soviet and post-Soviet humanities to the social and political vocabulary, for a long time this impact was not as noticeable in Russia as in the West. It was only in 2000-2010s when active development of corresponding scholar approaches started and the key works of R. Koselleck, K. Skinner and other scholars were translated. After Russian readers studied achievements of the leading schools, German Historical Institute in Moscow issued a translation of selected articles from the German dictionary "Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe: Historisches Lexikon zur politisch-sozialen Sprache in Deutschland" (1972-1997), edited by O. Brunner, W. Conze and R. Koselleck. This article reviews the translated book in the context of Russian studying of the history of concepts and the formation of this approach as a political sub-discipline. In accordance with the approach proposed by J. Farr, the methodological basis for the studying of social and political concepts should be "political theory of conceptual change" which deals with language as a political tool, and with conceptual changes as political changes. One of the characteristics of development of a scientific discipline is formation of a system of reference books. Russian scholars have already gained considerable experience in the study of social and political concepts, which allows to approach closely the issue of the preparation of reference books and systematic descriptions of Russian concepts.

AB Analyzing economic studies of the resource curse, the author points out their methodological incompleteness. Dealing predominantly with modern economy and ignoring extensive structural changes, they cannot reveal essential principles; some questions remain unanswered, such as how fatal this mechanism can be. The effects or resource availability on economy and society have been initially studied not only in political economy and in economic theory, but also in all social sciences of which sociology has been a linchpin. Today, sociological approach is essential for research of the resource curse phenomenon; its key point is to reveal objective laws of social structural transformations. Impact of resource abundance not only on economic dynamics but on development of modern economy has to be studied, but also on the process of its formation including necessary analysis of qualitative and quantitative changes that accompany transformation of agrarian society into industrial one. Methods of historical sociology enable to refute widely accepted arguments of the resource curse opponents ("Norwegian", "American" and "Canadian" ones). Basing on the results of own research, author, in contradiction to the views dominating in economic theory, insists that the mechanism of the resource curse has fatal effects, when it comes to the countries where modernization is not completed and where structure and values of modern industrial society have taken root. Macrosociological research shows that in countries with incomplete modernization (where modern mechanisms of the elites' selection are absent or have not developed yet) resource abundance has negative consequences in the longer term: if there are objective conditions for its exposure, it always leads either to stagnation or to decline of economy and society. High resource supply invariably leads to export dependency, when all characteristics of the resource curse actualize.

DE integration; educational system; scientific and educational cooperation;
   cultural significance; political importance; political differences;
   interaction; and mutual influence
AB The purpose of research revealing the role and significance of integration processes in the European education from the standpoint of their assessment as a tool of practical cooperation between the West and the East. The study of authors was based on the method of induction, the logical method, the futurist (prognostic) method, general scientific dialectic method. The results of this study can be used in the course of implementation of educational policies and educational reforms in the Russian Federation, as well as for further improvement of the mechanism of interaction between scientific and educational communities of Russia and Europe and its member States in the field of education and science.
   The authors investigate the mechanisms of interaction and mutual influence that occurs in the course of integration of European education. Evaluate the most effective forms of scientific and educational cooperation, promoting the development of cultural dialogue between Russia and the West. The modern world is a complex, contradictory, but a single organism. The planetary problems, particularly those that threaten humanity today,help to realize that fact. Such problems as international terrorism, poor environment, pandemics can only be solved by joint efforts of all highly developed countries. However, the unification of these efforts is hampered by existing world disunity, especially noticeable in connection with the aggravation of relations between the West in the face of US and Western Europe and the East in the face of Russia.
   According to the authors of the article, the reasons for periodic exacerbation of relations between Russia and the West are not only political and economic contradictions. The underlying causes consist in the difference of attitude, different understanding of those or other values, in the assessment of different development objectives and priorities. Thus, the main line of division between Russia and the Western world (primarily Europe) is in the field of mentality, and this is due to the differences of spiritual and moral values underlying the Russian and Western societies. However, the necessity of combating global threats causes the need to find points of contact between Russia and Europe. According to the authors of the article, in terms of economic and political differences that education can become a global, permanent channel of interaction between East and West. In future this will allow to overcome the existing alienation, which will contribute to strengthening cooperation of Russia with the rest of the world.
   On this basis, the article states argues that integration of educational systems of Russia and Europe, actively ongoing in the framework of the Bologna process, has not only educational and cultural value, but is also of great political significance. This integration is not exhausted by the unification of educational standards, it is a step towards the development of European civilization.

A thesis of pure logic is formulated and contradiction that hiding in its foundation is shown. Conditions of reliability of logical and theoretical positions are discussed. Principle of evidence (Evidenz) proposed by E. Husserl as a methodological solution to the problem of justification of logic laws is considered. It turns out that in the foundation of the principle of evidence exist paradoxical statement of probabilistic logic and theoretical truth. It was concluded that problem of reliability logic and theoretical principles in format of pure logic is impossible.

DE Gorgias; "On Non-Being"; holism; intentional acts; intentional objects
AB In this paper we continue to analyze Gorgias' argumentation in the third argument of the treatise "On Non-Being". We denote the benefits for the interpretation of this argument can arose, if we accept the suggestion that Gorgias implicitly use (in the third argument of "On Non-Being", apud De Melisso Xenophane Gorgia, VI, 23-26; it is grounded here that the content of one man's thought cannot be communicate to another man) a holistic understanding of a whole. We offer an interpretation of Gorgias' argument here, in which he proves two theses: I. Different subjects cannot comprehend the same internal intentional object ( 23, 25); and II. Different subjects cannot comprehend the same real intentional object ( 24). We suggested that in II. Gorgias implicitly exploited the two assumptions that could be used by Parmenides in his poem - in some arguments against plurality of being. The first assumption asserts the identity of an intentional act and its object, and the second one - the indistinguishable of such a objects which cannot exist (be thought of, be comprehended) without each other. Furthermore, both in I. and II. the third assumption is used: a whole or a complex object is a holistic one - i.e. its constituents are determined by each other, and so they cannot exist without each other. Our interpretation helps to reveal the significant logical connection between Gorgias' arguments under consideration and some statements in Parmenides' poem, and also Protagoras' thesis that man is the measure of all things. In this aspect our interpretation is different from A. Mourelatos' interpretation, who rejects that Gorgias relies on Protagoras' thesis. Moreover, our interpretation of 23-26 makes Gorgias' reasoning in each thesis of the third argument uniform one and treats it as proceeding from the same principles - in contrast to A. Mourelatos' approach.

It is examined both changes in social space and the process of enlargement and "devaluation" of space as well. The author explores the transformation of the concept of "place" affected by car culture, as well as the beginning of the notion of "non-place" in contemporary culture. The same time a car itself is considered in the context of the concept of place, so as for modern man it has many characteristics that are inherent to the traditional comprehension of place. Also, the automobile is regarded as a means of connecting places and non-places into a single social and individual space.

DE axiomatic-system-of-philosophical-epistemology; a-priori-knowledge;
   Leibniz'optimism; Hume's-guillotine;
   Moore's-doctrine-of-naturalistic-fallacy
AB The paper submits a new (substantially expanded) system of own axioms for the general philosophical theory of knowledge. In comparison with the previous option of axiomatizing epistemology some novel terms are added to the language of the axiomatic theory, for instance, the term "an algorithm exists (a machine can be constructed) for deciding that p", where p stands for a proposition. Precise definitions of meanings of the newly introduced terms are given indirectly by adding corresponding new own axioms of epistemology to the axiomatic system which axioms have not been included into the system hitherto. The submitted new axiomatic epistemology system makes up new precise definitions of the notions "a-priori-knowledge" and "a-posteriori-one". In the axiomatic system the two kinds of knowledge are precisely defined by means of compositions of epistemic, alethic, deontic, axiological and other modalities. Systematically exploiting the hypothetic-deductive method the author investigates the set of logic consequences of accepting the mentioned hypothetical precise definitions of the epistemic modalities "a-priori-knowledge-of-being" and "a-priori-knowledge-of-value" and of the graphic representation of their logical interrelations by means of the logical square-and-hexagon. In particular, at the level of artificial language a strict formal derivation of "it is obligatory that p" from " there is a-priory knowledge that p" is constructed within the framework of the submitted axiomatic epistemology system. Within the same system at the same level a strict formal derivation of " it is good that p" from " there is a-priory knowledge that p" is constructed as well. Moreover it is formally proved in the present paper that in the axiomatic system under consideration there is the logic equivalence between the modalities " it is obligatory that p" and " it is good that p", if it is true that " there is a-priory knowledge that p". The submitted new (significantly transformed and complemented) axiomatic system is applied to the relevant concrete material of the history of philosophy, namely, to G.W. Leibniz', D. Hume's, and G.E. Moore's philosophical epistemology views.

DE Hermeneutics; Interpretation; Japanese Philosophy; Philosophy of
   Language; Kotodama
AB The article deals with the Japanese philosophical concept of kotodama, and its role in comprehensive of reality. Starting with analysis of both koto and tama, which are parts of kotodama compound, describe the place of tama conception in spiritual structure of Ancient Japan cosmos, comparing it with well known conception of kami. As a result, we understand that kotodama is a spirit of word, which can be taken out through the process of kotoage, which is clarified as well. Finally, observing the collocations of word kotodama in the Man'yoshu songs, I conclude that this conception is mentioned only in "geographical" context, but in "personal" one, and I can assume that on the early stage of its history Japan was impersonal oriented culture. Looking through a number of kotodama theories by different thinkers, I feature kotodama's central place is Japanese understanding of reality and its sociolingustical relation. During the analysis of the second part of compound - koto - I explicate the idea of ontological nondistinction that lies behind differences between subjective name and objective thing, and between sense and reference. To support this assumption some examples of proverbs, usage of kotodama conception and makurakotoba in Man'yoshu are provided. Basing on the idea of the true essence of things, which exists in their empirical givenness and in language, and truth is a fundamental principle, which enables a word to become a deed, I continue with the thesis on the philosophical hermeneutics which took the central part in interpretation not only of any text, but of speech as well. To summarize the review of kotodama concept, can I say that this lack of distinction between words and actions leads to linguistic transparency of being? Can we understand the language as a metaphysical act, thanks to which is possible persistent formation of being-in-the-world and our presence in it? We tend to believe that the emancipation from the ontological distinction of words and actions, expressed by koto, says that the language of Japanese philosophy does not know such formidable obstacles, which stood in front of the philosophical language, formed under the influence of the grammatical structures of the Greek and Latin languages and their ontological implications and superstitions. Such difference has a direct impact on the interpretation and understanding. The possibility of interpretation not only a verb as an action, but a noun and any word at all, fundamentally changes the process of understanding. I conclude that Japanese way of understanding is not a comprehension of judgment, but a philosophical hermeneutics - the unity of the said and intended, because "they call upon each other, and the meaning occurs in this roll..."

DE schizophrenia; surrealism; semiotics
AB Schizophrenia, which Deleuze and Guattari described as "the disease of century," according to the WHO still strongly reinforces its position. Since 2000, the number "schizophrenia" diagnoses has increased by 40%. And the disease manifestations polymorphism is one of the main differential diagnostic problems. The lack of schizophrenia nosological unity is closely connected with the old question of the disease "essence". However, attempts to build some kind of a correct recognition and interpretation of this mental disorder type still have not given results. Due to the fact that most doctors consider schizophrenia not as a single disease, and as a group of psychoses, with a similar picture of the flow, the diagnosis F20 (schizophrenia) is made on set of the disease most malignant manifestations. It actualizes search for new diagnostic methods to complement the main ones. Psychiatry and medical psychology widely use for this aim projective tests (one of the most common test is "House. Tree. Man"). If a projective test is aimed at a holistic approach to the assessment individual, the present study focuses on the semiotic forms of disrupted mind. In the patients rehabilitation practice art therapy is widely used, it gives a variety of artistic material for the signs, "language", schizophrenia "discourse" analysis. The schizophrenic often substitutes one language for another - verbal language for the drawing language. The conceptual basis of this researching is the Timothy Crow (English psychiatrist) hypothesis, that schizophrenia is a language disease. The article identifies correlation between sign (drawing) and symptom (the signified). The surrealism art practices are interpreted in this researching as surrealism declares insanity as an artistic reality. Through using examples of TCPH patient drawings, the insane and the surrealists creativity comparative analysis is made in the article. It is concluded that Surrealism, in contrast to the schizophrenics art, only simulates illness, at the same time compositionally and associativly it remains in the European art field.

DE Image of Slavdom; Slavic world; first wave of Russian emigration;
   Russian community in France; "Russianness"
AB It is often considered that the Slavic world is part of the territory that used to be the USSR, and the image of Slavdom belongs strictly to those who inhabit said territory. In reality, beyond the ex-USSR live a large amount of different Slavic communities (France, Germany, USA, Argentina, China, etc.), who are also concerned by how the image of Slavdom is transformed over time. The authors take one of such communities, probably one of the most known - the Russian community in France. Using one of its main constituents - the first wave of emigration and its descendants as an example, they try to educe the image of Slavdom beyond the "common" Slavic world. During the civil war that ensued after the Revolution of 1917, many of the people of the ex-Russian Empire were forced to leave their homeland and move to other countries. According to the calculations of the "Association of Russians in France" from the 1 million of emigrants that left the country, over one quarter settled in France between 1925-1926. Most of them settled in Paris and its periphery and formed there a Russian community. To educe the image of Slavdom, the authors use the definition of Russianness in the rhetoric of the old and young generation of the first wave of Russian emigration. For the old generation, the authors base their research on their memoirs. To have a larger selection the authors use the memoirs of different social groups, from the high aristocracy to the middle class. As for the young generation, the research is based on articles that address said subject on websites and social media that are part of the modern Russian community in France. The fact that said Russian community exists to this day and that it's members continue to actively interact within it, would suggest that the descendants of the first wave of emigration managed to preserve their Russian identity, that their ancestors desperately wanted to preserve. The researched proved that the French integrative policy was very successful and despite the fact they actively partake in the life of the community, most of the descendants consider themselves as mainly French and see their Russian roots as a non-determinant part of themselves. Despite that fact, the authors managed to isolate the image of the "Russian" in the conscious of the members of the first wave of emigration. It's the image of a conservator of Russian faith, culture, language and first and foremost of Russian values. And despite their "Frenchness", in their will to defend the main European values, the authors find that long forgotten Russianness in the modern generation of the Russian community.

TI "NATIONAL IN FORM, SOCIALIST IN CONTENT": THE BURYAT NATION IN THE
   SOVIET IDEOLOGICAL DISCOURSE
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE national policy; Soviet power; socialist culture; ethnicity
AB The main aim of this work is to investigate the nation-building processes and "national" identities construction in the USSR, the reconstruction of the Soviet ideology from the point of view of its use in the practice of nation-building. The main task is to analyze the correlation and relationships between ethnicity and ideology - concepts that determined the political practice of the power. The sources of the research are the text corpus that formed the basis of the power discourse on this issue: official reports and speeches of the Communist leaders of the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomous Republic, materials of the Party and republican meetings and conventions that developed the strategy and the tactics of the (ethno-)national policy. The analysis of the sources demonstrates how ethnicity transformed from a lever of population mobilization under the flag of nationalism into a reliable tool of the Communist control of the national periphery. This situation opened space for the conceptualization of the idea of a united social community - the Soviet people. Construction of "socialist nations", simultaneous repression of traditional cultures and actualization of the Soviet internationalism ideas - all this contributed to the strengthening of the Communist regime and the formation of a unified political community within the boundaries of the USSR. Ethnicity began to play a special role in these processes at the national periphery; after appropriate processing it was included in the ideological arsenal of the Soviet state. The main declared aim of the Soviet state was to build a Communist society; accordingly, ethnic policy was largely conditioned by the aspiration to achieve this aim. The authors concluded that the Soviet ideological discourse constructed a complex system of identities where loyalties of political and socio-cultural nature took place and reconciled. Bringing nationalism into their program, the Communists saw it as a tactical tool that would eventually overcome the dominance of local identities and contribute to the development of a common political identity within the boundaries of the USSR. In this sense, they can be described as "internationalist nationalists", whose actions, however, focused primarily on the formation of a united Soviet community, rather than on encouraging separate national identities. Ethnic culture and tradition, which had to be preserved because of political expediency, were auxiliary raw "material" exposed to active construction. Everything that did not fit into the framework of the Marxist-Leninist ideology was cut off this material.

The empirical base of the work served as the political history of a major industrial center, reconstructed on the basis of an analysis of the media and biographical interviews. The authors show how to change the configuration of power in the political and economic processes of the 1990s.: from "elitism" model, typical of the Soviet industrial city, to "pluralism", and then to the local political regime. After the leader of offset coalition collapsed, and the new power configuration of the acquired characteristic features elite monocentrism.

DE an image of a town; a brand of a town; an image of a territory;

AB The article deals with different mechanisms of territorial image and branding which are very topical nowadays. We search them on the base of Siberian towns Tomsk and Irkutsk.
   According to Tomsk Region Administration, this town has not only educational potential but also industry and investment potential, agro-industrial complex, a special economic zone. In connection with this trend it was necessary to create new visual and verbal style of a territorial brand of Tomsk Region. "The competition for the best conception of visual and verbal style of territorial brand of Tomsk Region" started 16.07.2015. This competition was organized by the Fund of territory's promotion and development and Tomsk Region Administration. In the first part of our research we gave general characteristic of verbal style of these conceptions.
   The second part of our study was devoted to identifying the awareness of residents and visitors about the town's territorial brand and the voting. According to the results of the voting we made a conclusion about resident's opinion. They perceive Tomsk as Siberian Athens because there are many universities there. Attempts of changing this image had no success.
   The last part of our study was devoted to identifying the awareness of residents and visitors about Irkutsk's territorial brand. According to the results of the survey we made a conclusion that the most perspective image trend of the town is "Irkutsk - the gate to Baikal". If we compare resident's awareness of the images of Siberian towns we can see that the majority of respondents don't know what image has the territory. That's why the authors think that positioning of the brand and the image of the town isn't conducted at the proper level. The town's branding will be effective only if it will have elaborate and well structured conception.

This modus is considered a product of the Soviet political discourse. With its ideological orientation and positive evaluation, the modus of the Soviet political discourse is stabilized in the Russian adjective "sovetskiy" and its Czech equivalent. The Soviet political discourse was an external social authority for the Russian and Czech media discourses; however, they vary in their distinctions of value systems, which explains the specificity of interpretation of the speech segments stabilized by modus in the Soviet political discourse. As a result, the models of its reinterpretation in the Russian and Czech media discourses show both similar and different elements. The similarities are determined by 1) common political and ideological past; 2) common media intentions, which is manifested in the possibility of evaluation neutralizing and reinterpretation. The differences are mainly determined by the perception of the Soviet as an ideological model of our / their state that is realised in 1) the degree of differentiation of the evaluated object; 2) the presence / absence of the fact of using this adjective for positive evaluation.

The main goal of the EU in these circumstances becomes stabilisation of the political situation in partner countries. The South Caucasus states build the relationship with the EU in different formats. The article relates to the preconditions and the essence of the European Neighborhood Policy, reviews peculiar features of the EU-Armenia, EU-Georgia and EU-Azerbaijan relationships. The author draws a conclusion that the focus of the European Neighborhood programme on democratic reforms and economic cooperation does not provide answers to long-term and deeply rooted rifts in relations between the countries, which are the biggest obstacle for the region's development.

The challenges that the pension system in Germany has confronted at the beginning of new millennium are described including the negatively impact on the balance of insurance contributions and pension payments. The demographic factor is specifically addressed. Solutions introduced in course of reforms implemented by Gerhard Schroeder's government mean a new change in the paradigm. Further political steps are described as well as main components of consequent reforms and their political driving forces and current interim results.

Meaningfulness criteria of statements are discussed. The conclusion is that the principle of contradiction has psychological nature.

TI HOW STRONG IS THE EVOLUTIONARY ARGUMENT AGAINST EPIPHENOMENALISM?

DE consciousness; mind; phenomenal consciousness; epiphenomenalism;
   evolution; local interactionism
AB The article includes three parts: historical background, discussion of the strong version of the argument, and introduction of a moderate version of the argument. The evolutionary argument against epiphenomenalism is often attributed to Herbert Spencer, who allegedly stated it in the second edition of "The principles of psychology" (1870). If so, the argument appeared before formulating the thesis of epiphenomenalism by Thomas Huxley in his article "On the Hypothesis that Animals Are Automata, and Its History" (1874). The first classical statement of the argument is attributed to William James (1879). George Romanes could invent this argument independently of James in 1882. In Russia the argument was known as early as in 1889, when Lev Lopatin explicated it in his work "The Question of Free Will". Most probably, Russian philosophers got acquainted with it through the works of their German colleagues. Epipheomenalism is a theory that denies any causal efficiency of consciousness. James has formulated the strong version of the argument, which starts with an observation of the connection of the conscious states and behavior, and proceeds to the conclusion that consciousness is an evolutionary important feature of human species, hence consciousness is causally efficient, and epiphenomenalism is false. This argument is built on a supposition that conscious is important for the natural selection, which must be empirically based. But epiphenomenalists show, that it cannot be empirically demonstrated. The strong version of the argument is unsound. The thesis of evolutionary importance of consciousness is, at least, trustworthy, but epiphenomenalists sacrifice it in favor of another important principle: the principle of causal closure. The price is the isolation of epiphenomenalism from the theory of evolution - a crucial part of modern biology. But it is possible to unite both principles in the scope of one theory. For example, it could be Vadim Vasyliev's local interactionism. This is the moderate version of the evolutionary argument: any theory, which includes both thesis of evolutionary importance of consciousness and thesis of causal closure is more preferable than epiphenomenalism.

DE Multilateral bargaining; Equilibrium uniqueness; Veto players
AB In political economy, the seminal contribution of the Baron-Ferejohn bargaining model constitutes an important milestone for the study of legislative policy making. In this paper, we analyze a particular equilibrium characteristic of this model, equilibrium uniqueness. The Baron-Ferejohn model yields a class of payoff-unique stationary subgame perfect equilibria (SSPE) in which players' equilibrium strategies are not uniquely determined. We first provide a formal proof of the multiplicity of equilibrium strategies. This also enables us to establish some important properties of SSPE. We then introduce veto players into the original Baron-Ferejohn model. We state the conditions under which the new model has a unique SSPE not only in terms of payoffs but also in terms of players' equilibrium strategies.

   THE WORKS OF HOBBES AND KANT

LA Russian
DT Article
DE natural law; international relations; political conflict; international
   security; social contract
AB The article analyzes the historical and intellectual context of the revival of interest in the modern science to the works of T. Hobbes and I. Kant as the founders of two classical traditions in the International Relations (IR) theory-political realism and idealism. The heuristic value of the International Relations theory they produced is explained by the fact that in their works they embodied the ideal understanding of the world order based on the interaction of sovereign states in the interests of keeping global peace and security. The political theories of Hobbes and Kant reflected the foreign policy realities of the Enlightenment. The experience of the Thirty Years' War in Europe and the English Civil War in the 17th century made Hobbes consider three universal and permanent sources of military conflicts: the competition for resources, need for glory (domination), and fear and distrust to the enemy generating the desire to protect themselves. Kant's Perpetual Peace (1795), written under the French Revolution impression, proposed a republican project of a free federation of peace-loving peoples as a regulatory and institutional foundation of the international order as "a global civil status of public state security". The comparative analysis of the works of the English and German philosophers confirms the common grounds which determined the subsequent development of the theory of IR. The natural law doctrine was the result of the conceptual unity of classical political realism and political idealism. Its ideological value formed a categorical apparatus of the modern IR study: the principle of the sovereign equality of states as the main actors of international communication; the idea of inevitability of anarchy in international relations; the "balance of power" theory; the idea of the universal and conventional nature of international law; the concepts of "security dilemma" and "rational choice", the " zero-sum game" and many others. Research practice of Hobbes and Kant largely determined the nature of the modern world political discourse with its emphasis on the interdependence of states' domestic and foreign policy, the ratio of the moral, legal and regulatory power in international relations, the sociocultural and psychological motivation of the world process participants, regardless of their status and political nature. The conflict of interpretations of classical International Relations theories in the modern political science resulted in a new understanding of the nature of international security and the means of its provision: cooperation based on trust and mutual willingness to compromise; rational and responsible choice of means and methods of ensuring national and global security; joint construction of legal foundations of the world order to address global issues and counter global threats-this is not a complete list of the characteristics of an ideal regulatory system of international relations, whose origins can be found in the works of Hobbes and Kant, the classics of the International Relations theory.

DE mental state; Spinoza; consciousness; affect
AB This paper provides a comparative analysis of the Spinoza's notion of "affect" and "mental state" of John Searle. It is concluded that Spinoza's affect is a prototype of the notion of mental state, which is highly admitted as an essential element of the subject's mental life in the contemporary philosophy of mind. The analysis of contemporary philosophy of mind allows to assert that philosophical ideas about mental states are a continuation of the Modern's Philosophy theorizing. But it is inacceptable to identify a mental state as an affect or vice versa for the next reasons:
   Affect is presented as a phenomenon, connected with body, but without determination by brain.
   Affect is an idealistic concept, though it is not related with the classical Cartesian dualism
   The concept of the mental state, originated from the materialistic ideas about mind, consciousness and their functioning, is still developing now. In particular, a conceptual model of John Searle shows a causal connection between physical and mental. His premise leads to the obvious conclusion that psychical activity ends with the death of a subject, primarily the brain's death.
   Similarities between the notions of the affect and the mental state:
   1. Both phenomena are able to predetermine the set of possible cognitive functions.
   2. A way of affect's existing, as a stage, is similar to the mental state. Their stages could be formalized as a genesis-development-result scheme.

AB The research objective was discussion of an essence what was necessary to accompany with silence in the context of the statement "whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent". It would allow finding new ways for strengthening of any explanatory interpretation of ideas of L. Wittgenstein. The author believed that L. Wittgenstein allowed basic mixture of language (set of signs and rules of their application) and the speech (practice of the use of signs in the course of communication). Strict distinction of these phenomena allowed to bypass "ban" on promotion of statements concerning about what in standard conditions it was necessary to be silent. At the same time the question of all variety of ways of understanding of language and the speech in the context of L. Wittgenstein's statements was reduced to a problem of so-called individual language as formation process of "inner speech". The author reasons, what exactly this phenomenon opened by L.S. Vygotsky, allowed to clear borders in which L. Wittgenstein's statement "whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" lost the general meaning and became only a case of speech practice along with other options of communication. It was as a result revealed that the thinking and language had no indissoluble communication though the thinking and could not be carried out without use of the general forms of language. Application of language within the inner speech was capable to conduct to a relative extra rationality of statements because language in this moment was applied without use of the general forms of thinking. In this case statements were clear only speaking, and the general possibility of their basic clearing was provided with a creation context of "individual phrases".

AB The paper is devoted to discussing such a new form of analytical philosophy of law-and-morals which is mathematically represented by two-valued algebraic system of formal ethics-and-natural-law. This algebra of the natural-law-and-formal-ethics is used for systematical analysis of moral-legal forms of (any) either-good-or-bad activity in general. The new form of analytical philosophy of law-and-morals immediately (directly) deals not with logic-forms of thought-and-speech about moral-legal activity but with moral-legal-forms of (either-good-or-bad) activity. Thus the subject-matter of direct (immediate) analyzing is significantly shifted from the logical-linguistic-form of thinking to the moral-legal-one of acting. Within the scope of the mentioned algebraic system the notions "formal-axiological equivalence of moral-legal-activity-forms" and "(universal) law of algebra of formal ethics-and-natural-law (=constantly-good moral-legal-act-form)" are defined precisely. Introducing the mentioned algebra makes up a possibility to investigate compositions of alethic, deontic, and axiological modalities, for instance, the complex ones: "it is (alethically) necessary that it is (legally) obligatory that p"; " it is (alethically) necessary that it is (morally) good that p". In the present paper the indicated formal-ethical machinery is exploited for limiting precisely the domain of relevant applicability of the famous logical-philosophical principle somewhat conventionally called " Guillotine of Hume". For implementing this limitation the author submits new (hitherto not discussed) compound definitions of the epistemic modalities " a priori knowledge that p" and "a posteriori one that p". Accepting these definitions logically entails accepting a precise formal limitation of the scope of "Hume's Guillotine". The submitted precise formal limitation of sphere of correct applicability of "Guillotine of Hume" is modeled graphically by means of logical square and hexagon of opposition of relevant compositions of epistemic, alethic, deontic and axiological modalities related to the theme under discussion.

AB In the article we tried to overcome the stereotypes that are associated with the understanding of the Sophistic, firstly, as rhetorical or pedagogical practice mainly, deprived of philosophical content, and, secondly, - insisting on the philosophical component of the sophistic movement, we intend to show that it is not a philosophy of relativism or nihilism, as it was supposed by history of philosophy in XIX-XX century. The Sophistic is a fully valid part of philosophy, but it has significant differences with Academics and Peripatetics, who, based on the essentialist program and related with it understanding of truth, interpreted the Sophistics by principles of their own fundamentalist paradigm. We interpret the sophistic philosophy applying to it the concept of descriptive epistemology, and we intend to apply it to the sophistic principle of philosophical inquiry in Antiquity. Our interpretation of Gorgias doctrine is based on this premise. As ontology the Gorgias' doctrine appears as criticism of the Eleatics and Pluralists (Empedocles), demonstrating the fallacy of their doctrines of what-is and what-is-not, as epistemology its shows criticism of the theory of knowledge, demonstrating the failure of previous concepts of the known object and the knowing subject. These features of Gorgias' philosophy allow us to speak of him as the creator of a new paradigm of descriptive epistemology and forerunner Pyrrhonism. A main feature of the philosophy of Gorgias is its new and original doctrine of language as a tool of knowledge and framing the world.

DE India; religious structure of population; fertility; regional
   differences; 2011 population census; 2005-2006 demographic and health
   survey
AB The article contains a brief overview of the religious composition of Indian population within the first decade of the twenty-first century. We experienced a known difficulty when obtaining statistics on the religious composition of the Indian public due to its irregular promulgation. Changing disparities in the proportion of the states and union territories' major religions on the basis of 2001 and 2011 National Censuses and 2005-2006 Demographic and Health Survey data are analyzed in detail. At present Hindus constitute the vast majority of the 21 states and 6 union territories' population. The Muslims are in majority in the state of Jammu and Kashmir and in the union territory of Lakshadweep. Traditionally, North-Eastern India has the highest proportion of Christians: they absolutely prevail in the states of Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya and form a relative majority in the states of Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur. It is revealed that increase in absolute numbers of Hinduism (an increase of 138.7 million people from 2001 until 2011), Islam (34.1 million), Christianity (3.7 million), Sikhism (1.6 million), Buddhism (0.5 million) and Jainism (0.2 million) adherents was accompanied by an increase in the only Muslim share in total population. Currently in India a natural increase difference between the numbers of births and deaths -makes the largest contribution to the growth of number of the major religions adherents (except perhaps Christianity). It is established that indicators of Muslim, Hindu, Christian and Buddhist fertility are sufficient to save the level of their basic reproduction. It is shown that, at the same time, the growth rate of only Muslim population exceeds the national average level. It is stated that the fall in the proportion of Hindus below the psychologically important mark of 80 % may be an additional factor of destabilization of inter-religious relations in India. That was the reason why the 2011 census data on religious affiliation of India population were published (quite possibly intentionally) only four years after parliamentary elections had been held and the central government had been formed. It is significant that while the proportion of Hindu population to the total population in 2011 had declined, the pro-Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People's Party) came to power in 2014 and the Indian National Congress, adhered to the secular political tradition, suffered one of the most crushing defeats in its history after it had been in power for ten years.

TI IMPORT SUBSTITUTION IN ARGENTINA: AIMS AND RESULTS
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Argentina; agrarian export; Great Depression; import substitution; super
   industrialization; neoliberal reforms; crisis
AB Import substitution policy replaced the model of export-oriented agricultural economy that existed in Argentina during the period of 1870-1929. Its mechanism was relatively simple: agricultural products, for which the country had optimal natural conditions, were exported to the external markets, while wide range of industrial products, machinery and equipment were imported. Exports generated substantial revenues (providing a lion's share of state income), and the imports quite satisfied domestic demand for capital and consumer goods. The history of import substitution policy in Argentina can be divided into two stages. At the first stage (1930-1952), the government created its basic tools with a stress on development of labor-intensive light industries whose products were inteneded to meet domestic consumer demand. During the second phase (1953-1976), Argentine political establishment, not satisfied with the results achieved in the previous period, initiated the policy of "super industrialization", namely, the creation or expansion of basic capital-intensive industries: metallurgy, machinery, chemicals and petrochemicals, energy. In these years domestic production of machinery and equipment for agriculture and light industry, durables, pharmaceuticals increased dramatically, the national military-industrial complex, scientific and technical sectors were created. In other words, Argentine's policy of import substitution created a new frame of economic relations. It brought both positive and negative results which fully showed up in mid 70s. Since then, the crisis of import substitution policy became especially evident amidst the world process of globalization and dynamic formation of world-wide value-added chains. Argentina found itself largely isolated from these trends and came into clinch with the changing external conditions. So, under the rumbling populist and nationalist rhetoric it proceeded into the prolonged recession.

TI INDONESIA AS AN EXAMPLE OF MODERNIZATION
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Indonesia; modernization; globalization; authoritarianism; bureaucratic
   capitalism; import substitution; developing countries; "directed
   democracy"; "new order"
AB Indonesia has made significant modernization breakthrough in the 70-90-ies of the twentieth century which brought the country into a number of second-generation NICs. A variety of factors contributed to this success. First, a huge assistance of Western countries to the "New order" of Suharto, because of its anti-communist orientation. Second, the combination of import substitution and export of raw materials (oil, gas, wood). Third, the economic policy of creating industrial conglomerates operating in a wide range of industries. And at last, the maintenance of political stability, ensured by the dominance of military and intelligence agencies which played a significant role in the home policy and, also, a kind of flexible personal policy of the president. The system of bureaucratic capitalism, which existed in the country, strengthened during the years of Suharto. Balancing between the interests of different groups of military, political and business elite, Suharto for a long time kept the emerging conflicts in the "cold" condition. Thus gradually a large proportion of the Indonesian industry and finance concentrated in the hands of the president's relatives and his friends from the military, government officials and Chinese entrepreneurs. As a result, the success of modernization was too obviously intertwined with the welfare of the "family", and stability - with the preservation of an authoritarian regime. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 not only weakened the economic position of Indonesia, but also led to the collapse of the Suharto's "new order". It took almost ten years to return to its previous level of development. Democratic reforms and change of elites, which happened in this period, allowed to maintain the integrity of the country and gave an impetus to the transition from bureaucratic capitalism to oligarchic capitalism. However, the role of the state, in its renewed, more democratic forms, still stays significant in Indonesia. It has to solve a lot of problems, ranging from the struggle against corruption and the manifestations of separatism, to weakening inevitable growing imbalances in the course of modernization.

DE an image of a town; territorial marketing; semiosphere; humanitarian
   geography
AB An image is a multi-faceted term which is used in different humanitarian sciences. If we generalize definitions, which are in economic and cultural literature, we can see that the image is described as a purposefully created type of a men, object, organization for definite society. This image is created for a rising of economic efficiency of activity of an image's subject with the help of ordered behavioral model. These definitions don't take into consideration the fact that nowadays marketing of a territory develops rapidly. Such section of image studies as the image of a territory is widespread now.
   In our study we create a semiotic model of the image of the town. This model represents a semiosphere, core of which are different concepts: the name of the town as a symbol (with different meanings for different segments), town symbols; formation of symbolic spatial and architecture concepts (which are marked in different figurative and geographic maps and based on interests of each segment); topical for specific target audience culture concepts (e.g. memorable places of outstanding personalities). These concepts will be transmitted to the target audience with the help of intentional communication (image advertising, image events of territorial marketing). The periphery of the model consists of sings and symbols of mass culture and marginal counterculture (legends of the town, myths, archetype, gossip), which will be transmitted to the target audience with the help of unintentional communication.
   In the context of our research of humanitarian geography we create approximate sample of figurative and geographic map on the base of which we can work out tourist and pilgrimage image of Tomsk.
   The image's model of the town should have different content for different target audience obligatorily. In this case it could be an effective tool of promotion of the town for investor, international community and tourists.

The Strategy is generally charactarized by the anti-Russian orientation, rather than the Euro-Atlantic choice of Ukraine. It doesn't foresee peaceful political settlement of the internal Ukrainian conflict as the crucial element for restoring the disrupted balances in Europe, including the Ukrainian-Russian relations. The article makes suggestions for possible Russian reaction to the Ukrainian Strategy, as well as practical steps in that context.

AB The general context that determines Russia's cooperation with the countries of the Latin American region at the current qualitative stage and the imperatives that drive the foreign economic and political interests of the Russian Federation and its counterparts, creating in certain situations prerequisites for strategic partnership, are characterized. The countries of Latin-Caribbean America provide us with an important alternative for the diversification of foreign economic relations and political cooperation, as well as for seeking additional reference points to position Russia in the international arena. In the present-day conditions, this is an especially valuable strategic circumstance. Sharing to an extent the concept of a polycentric world order, which widens the range for maneuvering in the world arena in choosing development models, the countries of this region objectively approach Russia in understanding the imperative of restructuring global regulatory mechanisms in line with the 21st-century realities. We are equally interested in democratizing access to these mechanisms and in the constructive interaction of global and regional institutions. Alongside the bilateral format of coordinating positions on these issues, informative dialogue using structures like BRICS is becoming increasingly effective.

Particular attention is paid to the competence approach, which was recognized mainly in the training of future specialists and professionals, as well as in the area of staff development. Views of domestic and foreign scholars on the phenomenon of "information competence", which is understood as an integrative attribute of a person and a professional, which is expressed in the ability to select, assimilate, analyze, generate and transmit information to make effective decisions, are revealed. Based on the results of her own research in some universities of Sverdlovsk region, the author defines the stage of influence and the use of Internet technologies in the educational process in high school on the possibility of formation of information competence of students and teachers. Summarized the fairly high stage of influence of modern Internet technologies in high school on level of information competence, there is a rare and unmotivated use of the Internet in the educational activity by as teachers and students themselves as well. There is a conclusion that there are many alternatives and opportunities for using them in everyday education life, including methods and ways to solve such a problem.

DE Education; science; plagiarism; anti-plagiarism; academic degree;
   applicant; publication; borrowed material
AB The problem of unfair loans acquires special relevance in a century of development of information technologies. The existence of easy electronic access to scientific sources, created by other scientists, generates temptation at some students and applicants of academic degrees to use results of their intellectual work. In some countries, for example, in the Russian Federation, the special system of measures of fight against plagiarism in an education system is developed. It is based on the idea that plagiarism, first of all, is the phenomenon deserving a negative ethical assessment. Plagiarism is the fact that trained or the applicant of an academic degree has no the required professional qualifications. He cannot conduct research independently and represent the results in the form conforming to requirements.
   The purpose of article is to analyze the effects and consequences of the fight against plagiarism as a result of interactions of two actors: The Ministry of Education and Science of Russian Federation (represented by subordinated institutions) and public organization "Dissernet" (http://www.dissernet.org).
   Methods. For the solution of research tasks content analysis (including statistical analysis), comparative analysis, case-study and interpretation were used.
   The official documents of the Higher Certifying Commission (HCC) of Ministry of Education and Science of Russian Federation obliging dissertation councils to carry out an inspection of theses on plagiarism existence are analyzed. Steps of verification of the thesis on use of the borrowed material by the special commission created by dissertation council after placement of the text of the thesis on the official site of the organization on the basis of which the dissertation council is created, and on the website belonging to the Higher Attestation Commission are characterized. The public organization "Dissernet" successfully initiates procedures of deprivation of scientific degree of scientists in which works on the basis of content and textual expertise plagiarism is found. On the basis of case-study methodology on a concrete example, procedure of deprivation of degree of the applicant is characterized in whose work plagiarism is found. The authors place graphical statistics for the period 2012 - 2016, according to which the Ministry of Education and Science has deprived academic degrees thanks to efforts of "Dissernet". At the level of training of masters the regulations of universities ordering to carry out an inspection on existence of plagiarism in master theses are analyzed. On the basis of the analysis of empirical data methods which are used by students in hope to deceive electronic system of check "Antiplagiat" system are shown.

   (Yalta) Conference of 1945; reparations; anti-Hitler coalition
AB Drawing on the documents from the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences (ARAN) the article studies the issue of the Soviet Union and its allies in the anti-Hitler coalition receiving reparations from vanquished Germany; as well as rebuilding of German economy in order to liquidate war industry and all industries potentially allowing Germany rebuild its military power; 10-years control over German economy; liquidation of research institutes that could be employed for military purposes; emphasis on development of light industry and agriculture. As the issue is of great scientific and political significance, further study and detection of archival documents, preparation of new document publications and comprehensive study of the issue is much needed, all the more so as the issue of reparations from Germany and its allies for a long time has been little studied. It's only in the recent years that the situation began to change. In 2004 the Sejm of the Republic of Poland proclaimed that Poland did not receive sufficient reparations, despite the fact that in 1990-1991 there were signed agreements on abandoning reciprocal claims. In 2008 Italy referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in Hague and demanded World War II reparations from Germany. The claim was not granted. In 2011 Greece also referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration to claim remains of World War II reparations. Recently there have been new claims from the Greek government. Both Poland and Greece are calculating their dues on reparations and compensations, despite previous agreement with the FRG. In this wake there are calls in the State Duma to calculate the reparations received by the Soviet Union and demand the dues.

AB We use data on economic, management and political science journals to produce quantitative estimates of (in) consistency of evaluations based on seven popular bibliometric indicators (impact factor, 5-year impact factor, immediacy index, article influence score, h-index, SNIP and SJR). We propose a new approach to aggregating journal rankings: since rank aggregation is a multicriteria decision problem, ordinal ranking methods from social choice theory may solve it. We apply either a direct ranking method based on majority rule (the Copeland rule, the Markovian method) or a sorting procedure based on a tournament solution, such as the uncovered set and the minimal externally stable set. We demonstrate that aggregate rankings reduce the number of contradictions and represent the set of single-indicator-based rankings better than any of the seven rankings themselves.

Putting quite diverse tasks, the authors believe in the inextricable scientific historiographical context historians of different times of pre - revolutionary and modern. Historiographical interests and creative efforts of each successive generations of historians allow to store in a modern national consciousness the memory and knowledge about the history of the predecessors and the history of science, which gives a special importance to the work on the publication of previously unreleased archives of scientific researchers.

AB The retrospective excurse is carried out showing basic evolutionary stages of development of social responsibility of economic entities during 1930-2016. Such stages are revealed as: well-doing business practice, guaranteeing the employment and safety of work, formation and development of local community, preservation of environment, orientation on a consumer and a quality of products, stimulation of innovative activity. The evolutionary stages of social responsibility development by economic entities listed form social potential for transition to a new type of industrial development. Specific attention is paid to neo-industrialization experience in Germany, that is carried out in the form of development of ultramodern production sector within the concept of "the Industry 4.0". Within its is carried out an integration of production and automation sector with information and communication technologies. The investigation carried out suggest an idea that new industrialization is, first of all, a new stage of evolutionary development of social and production consciousness, when the human is perceived as the valuable resource having the bigger importance, than natural resources or the wealth accumulated. Therefore social responsibility plays an important role on current stage of neo-industrialization. The results of practical research illustrate high theoretical and practical importance of the author's approach to the model of social responsibility of economic entities and necessity of its realization in a life.

AB This article brings together geo-economic cluster theory and enterprise export potential theory to undertake the export potential assessment in the pharmaceutical industry. Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis is used to identify correlation of micro and meso level cluster determinants (production potential, market potential, financial potential and labour potential), associated with high and low export potential assessment in Central Russia pharmaceutical clusters located in Russian regions. Findings identify a strong link between production potential as well as market potential and high exports potential capacity in most of clusters. The econometric model is deployed to clarify an objective causal link of the enterprise exports potential growth with the competitiveness factors of cluster origin (interactive business chains, local production chains width etc.). The authors worked out a set of measures to maximize the competitive advantages of cluster organization in the export activity of the enterprises in the pharmaceutical industry. Conclusions and recommendations of the study can be claimed by experts concerned with the export-oriented strategies of pharmaceutical enterprises in Russian regions based on cluster approach.

AB The article substantiates the impact of the international economic agreements on the development of regional international trade. The object of the study is regional foreign trade, the subject is the role of international agreements and negotiations in its development. The study purpose is to develop a scientific approach to assessment of impact of international agreements on the development of the region's foreign economic relations. The hypothesis substantiates the dependence of successful development of foreign trade on intensity of international agreements. The methodology is proven on example of Sverdlovsk Region and its contacts with basic trade partners. The main research method includes finding a correlation between intensity of international agreements with the volume and structure of foreign trade. The results of the study are important for all agents of foreign trade activities: firms, authorities, structures supporting the foreign economic activity. Taking into account the foreign trade factor allows increasing the efficiency of foreign economic contacts and helps achieving the higher results by entering the foreign markets. A more active involvement of the factor of international contacts furthers increasing of the foreign trade turnover, and export, and also diversification their structure, what allows to solve the most important problems of region in terms of globalization.

   SOVIET AND POST-SOVIET PROBLEMS
SO TERRA ECONOMICUS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE economic inequality; economic growth; methodological approaches
AB The relevance of the study of economic inequality as the most important problems of political economyis emphasized, in economic, sociological and political aspects. The author discusses the hypothesis by Simon Kuznets who won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for the impact of economic growth on the non-uniformity of distribution, based on an analysis of historical dynamics of income inequality. The article summarizes the methodological approaches to the study of the historical dynamics of inequality in income distribution, relationship between economic inequality and economic growth. It is shown that in the middle of the XX century, the concept of the natural cycle of inequality was dominated. However, there were not consensus in more recent studies about whether economic growth can be accompanied by a decrease, increase or preservation of inequality, while the growth of inequality may occur against a background of economic downturn.
   Special attention is paid to the comparison of the liberal economic approach, according to which inequality is a key tool for economic growth: the greater the inequality, the greater the economic growth - and the opposite point of view, which other researchers follow, viewing the inequality as a constraint for economic growth. The urgency of the problem of inequality in the Soviet period and its study is shown. The researchers of that time faced with the problem of differences between the real life and officially provided data. A significant contribution to the development of methodological base for political economy studies of inequality was made by J.A. Kronrod and A. P. Butenko. Their resultsserved as the impetus for reformatory ideas about the economic theory of socialism, which are of importance today as well.
   Empirical data showing inequality trends in the Soviet and post-Soviet periods are provided. It is shown that the market reforms in post-Soviet Russia has resultedin excessive income differentiation of the population and, as a consequence - sharp social polarization of society. It is concluded that at the present time in Russia the issue at stake is not income inequality as such, but rather itstransformation into particularly dangerous form of social and economic inequality. Unjustified excessive inequality of incomesamong the Russians is one of the major factors constraining economic growth, which is closely related to the value of consumer demand.

The article is based on materials from the archives of the 'Northern Star' Masonic Lodge which are kept in the the Department of Manuscripts of France's National Library in Paris. The materials are published in Russia for the first time. Gazdanov's speeches are reflected in the minutes of the Lodge's meetings, which helps to disclose his social, political and historical views. It is concluded that Gazdanov's spiritual path into Masonic ideology was hard. Russian Masonic Lodges in France were aimed at the rearrangement of the Russian government and society. Gazdanov, like other masons, took interest in the life of the USSR, soviet history, literature, culture, and ideology.

AB Studying the full spectrum ofthe Russian revolutionary movement of the early 20th century is essential for objective understanding of the pre-revolutionary situation in Imperial Russia. Anarchism, one of the extreme left ideologies, was rather popular during the First Russian revolution, but gradually went into decline. The benefits of its theoretical insightswere reaped after the Revolutions of 1917. Biographies of the social and political movement participants are important forstudyingthe ideologies, as well as the Russian Revolution and the Civil War. The publication is devoted to one of the national anarchist leaders of the first quarter of the 20th century, Lev Chorny (P.D. Turchaninov), founder of the "associational anarchism" and head of the Moscow Black Guard in 1918. The article focuses on his Siberian exile in 1907-1910. It is the least known part of his biography, and the publication strives toidentify the most important issues that troubled L. Chornyatthe time. Chorny's correspondence censored by the Department of Police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the YeniseiGubernial Directorate of Gendarmes is the basis of the research. The letters are being published for the first time. Gendarmerie records managementdemonstrate that police knew ofthe "associational anarchism" and considered it an unimportant trend in the Russian revolutionary movement. Overall, documents portraylife in Siberiaas one ofcrucial periodsof Turchaninov's biography: he lost almost all contact with his family, as well as manuscript of his major work; he refused to participate in the "Turukhansk revolt" (in winter 1908-1909). After his exile Turchaninov emigrated and until 1917 was out of step withthe Russian socio-political movement.

AB The article examines the stages of the national liberation struggle of the peoples of South-Eastern Europe against the Ottoman Empire. The Russian Empire supported the Christian population and helped the southern Slavs and the Greeks to get free from the Ottoman dependency. But Emperor Nicholas I opposed the revolution. The 1850s were marked by the strained political and economic relations between Russia, Turkey, Britain, France and other European States. The Bulgarian and the Greek bourgeoisie had moved from enlightment activity to the political one. Bulgarians, Serbs, Moldovans, Greeks joined the volunteers and defended national interests with the weapon in hands. During the Crimean war the Russian command created military units on the territory of the Danubian principalities. Volunteers fought on the Danube, in Moldavia and Wallachia, and the Crimea. They protected the borders, defended the bastions of Sevastopol. The subject of the research is the organization of volunteer groups, national and social composition of the groups. The role of volunteers was of an exclusive political significance. The number of volunteers in the ranks of Russian troops was insignificant. But the volunteers were guides of Russian policy in the Turkish lands. They represented the fighting core.

AB This article analyzes the interaction and mutual influence of the discourse of science and the public authorities in modern Russian and Anglo-American socio-humanities. The aim of the article is to identify the methodological bases of the research on discourse of the public authorities and science in the modern Anglo-American historiography and assessment of their relevance to the analysis of modern Russian administrative and scientific discourse. The authors conducted the analysis of Russian scientific products and revealed a positivist, quantitative bias in the methodology of social sciences, which study scientific and authoritative discourse in modern Russian society. The authors attempted to reflect the diffusion of science and power discourse. By the example of modern Russian realities they illustrated the pattern of how the researches on political discourse and influence of the state order on scientific production are strongly committed to this discourse and cannot go beyond it. An objective study of the experience of Anglo-American Russian studies allows looking at Russian governmental and scientific discourse from the perspective of a new culture, a new empire and a new intellectual history.

DE international migration; labor migrant; Chinese migrants; structure of
   Russian society; social integration
AB In the XXI century, international migratory flows from countries with weaker economies and from war zones to more developed regions. Large Russian cities attract a significant number of citizens from the former Soviet republics, while the Russian Far East is attractive for migrants from China due to his geographical position. Chinese migrants have been increasing all over the world and in Russia too. As a result, ethnic diversity of Russian regions increases, and problems of social integration of labor migrants become more urgent. The paper is based on the results of survey among Chinese migrants (105 participants) living in Far East cities (Vladivostok and Nakhodka) as well as on the results of a secondary analysis of statistical data and case studies data. The following principal barriers for successful integration of Chinese migrants were identified: unresolved legal status in Russia, language problems, Analysis of data from other Russian regions demonstrates the same trends. The international migration becomes an important socio-economic and demographic process that compensates population decline and needs of the labor market. At the same time, international migrants are not just an economical resource but represent social groups with various ethnic, socio-cultural and demographic characteristics, professional and social competencies, lifestyles, etc. For labor migrations the functional acculturation (that means developing skills and knowledge required to maintain stable labor relations in the receiving society, e.g. language skill, legal status) could be a solution a proper solution.

AB The French Revolution of the 18th century is one of the most important events of national as well as of world history. Its characters, principles and images are widely known. Additionally, the Revolution is a place of memory, which today continues to fuel the modern history /historiography, making its way between ideologies, memories and political struggle. Not surprisingly, there are libraries full of books about this event in France and abroad. However, the Revolution continues to conceal his meaning, in the traditional sense of the events with its causes and context, "slipping into the future" (S. Zizek). The article based on the works of French intellectuals shows (through the prism of changing the "order of time") how over the course of two centuries, the image of the revolutionary decade that shook the world was transformed at the intersection of scientific discourse, commemorative practices and social representations in the French society.

AB Globalization of information processes, the widespread penetration of information technology, the mass use of network services and their availability, are the cause of a new problem - the information security of a person and society. Availability of immoral, illegal content; the use of technology to promote unlawful acts, incitement to racial and other hatred, involvement of the new adherents to various political, sectarian, anti-social doctrines and trends; general culture decrease is influenced by the specificity of virtual communication and imaginary permissiveness - these and many other phenomena often bring irreparable harm to both an adult mature personality and a young, developing and unripe psyche of a teenager. Computerization and information, in particular, the introduction of information and communication technologies in the educational process have created a new kind of school behavioral problems - deviant behaviour in the field of information and communication technologies. The article is devoted to teacher training aspects of the deviant behaviour prevention in the field of ICT. The work represents the model of teacher competence on the aforesaid problem, its structure includes: key areas, sections, elements, performance criteria, necessary knowledge. The present work clarifies the concepts of "deviant behaviour in the field of information and communication technologies", "prevention of deviant behaviour in the field of information and communication technologies", the typology of deviations of behaviour in the field of ICT along with the viewing the main phenomena. There determined the main propositions of methods on realization of the complex of pedagogical conditions conducive to the efficiency of students education at pedagogical specialties of high school to the prevention of deviant behaviour of pupils in information and communication technologies. Materials research can be used to improve existing curricula and training programs for teachers to be training.

DE social group; ethnic group; ethnic consciousness; rise of ethnic
   consciousness; inter-ethnic tension; conflict; aversive attitudes;
   inter-ethnic border; ethno-contact situation
AB The article presents theoretical reflections on the phenomenon of inter-ethnic tension, which characterizes relations between ethnic groups that are in contact with each other. As a rule, the studies of inter-ethnic tension define it as a state of group consciousness of two or more ethnic groups with manifest aversion or hostility to each other. Inter-ethnic tension is often bolstered by emerging ethnic consciousness. The group consciousness revives the complexes of the "people that endured suffering" and that have "legitimate rights" ought to be recognized by the authorities and other ethnic groups. The rise of ethnic consciousness leads to a situation when most social problems are viewed as having ethnically-based causes. Among other ethnic groups ethnic consciousness chooses a "culprit" that has to amend for the past grievances. Inter-ethnic tension is often used by various social forces as an effective means of mobilization that assists in defending the economic and political interests of one of the factions of local or federal elites. In sociology, the problem of inter-ethnic tension is regarded as mobilization affected by economic, social and cultural factors. Aversive attitudes pose as one of the significant factors contributing to inter-ethnic tension. Aversive attitudes presuppose a latent rejection of an ethnic group in the form of avoidance of contacts with it and attributing it with negative characteristics. Research results show that the process of attribution is influenced by practices in which large groups of the population are involved, as well as by social relations in the society. Aversive attitudes are resilient to change and can persist even in a close ethno-contact situation with ethnic groups finding themselves in close relations. In a situation of social conflict aversive attitudes mutate into violence-laden attitudes. The state of inter-ethnic tension is dependent on many factors embedded in culture, social and economic relations. Therefore the study of the phenomenon requires a complex approach that includes a sum of circumstances in which ethnic groups find themselves.

DE Japan; Inoguchi Takashi; political science; politics; non-Western
   political theories; international relations; comparative studies
AB The author of this review tries to answer the question - "Is there non-Western political science?" targeting this analysis on the concept of one of the prominent Japanese thinkers, Inoguchi Takashi, and his texts published during the past 7-year period, and especially new book "Political Theory" (Seiji riron). According to Inoguchi, although political theory as a part of the modern discipline of political science emerged only in the 20th century, the origin of political theory are unquestionably in ancient thought - whether in the philosophy of Greece, Mesopotamia, Egypt, or China. Inoguchi points also at the birth of science in ancient India where the distinction between zero and one was first discovered. Again the non-West went ahead of the West. All this is meant to say that the adjective 'non-Western' is unnecessary. Inoguchi also turns to the distinction between the Abrahamic tradition and the Dharmic tradition. The former emphasizes the orientation of standardizing and unifying whereas the latter emphasizes the orientation of embracing diversity and respecting differences. The former is strongly associated with Christianity, Islam, and Judaism whereas the latter is strongly associated with Buddhism, Hinduism, Daoism and Shintoism. This distinction is often overlooked but important in discussing political science. Inoguchi's answer to the question in the title of this review is the following: "Neither Western political science, nor non-Westem political science; there is a political science of embracing and equilibrating two traditions - Abrahamic and Dharmic."

TI An Integrative Framework for Re-thinking 2nd Generation Sustainable
   Development (SD2.0) Projects, Education and the University as Catalyst
SO ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS IN EDUCATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AT
   UNIVERSITY LEVEL
SE World Sustainability Series
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
DE Integration; Capacity building; Socio-technical innovation
AB The University is poised to serve as the catalyst for an integrated, multi-sectoral, multi-scale approach that builds the requisite collective social and technical capacities of primary stakeholders to enable 2nd generation sustainable development (SD2.0). A synthesis of empirical evidence will be used to inform and justify a new integrative framework to design local and regional-scale projects, informed by the UN's SD21 Sustainable Development for the 21st Century report and the post-Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015) era. It will also be used to situate "education for sustainable development"-the theme of this book-in the integrative framework, to navigate the degree to which other additional components/aspects need to be considered for education to be impactful at the systems level. The framework involves five main axes of integration within which the University's role is shown to be central and catalytic: (1) socio-political stakeholder interests and influences; (2) development sectors (e.g. water, energy, health, food, the economy and climate resilience); (3) knowledge types (scientific and indigenous); (4) socio-technical capacities, including-but not limited to-education, research and information resources; and (5) connections among sites with SD2.0 projects, forming an innovation network. This process recognizes integration and social innovation to be primary for success, technology secondary, and education to be but one key component. We argue that this integrative approach does not require a reshaping of the University's primary role-as others have argued-rather an amplification of its commitments and responsibilities. By integrating within and across these five dimensions during the design phase for projects, programs, and formal curricula, a new path to transformational sustainability emerges practical and compelling. Three illustrative examples of SD2.0 work are given.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE official development assistance; China; Republic of Korea; Japan;
   Africa; Southeast Asia; support for economic growth; Beijing Consensus
AB The article focuses on new trends in development assistance strategies of three Northeast Asian countries: China, Japan and the Republic of Korea. It provides the analysis of key features of China's contemporary foreign aid strategy which is currently based mainly on economic priorities rather than on ideology. Building on post-reform successes in economic development, Beijing is expanding its assistance to African and Asian countries, thus demonstrating the efficiency of China's development model. Moreover, China implements foreign aid programs taking into account the individual recipient countries' priorities and specific features of their economic and social development. The authors gave attention to Beijing's willingness to use soft power tools for promoting aid programs. However, the active government involvement in formulation and implementation of foreign aid programs, as well as the predominance of commercial interests of Chinese businesses, are among the main characteristics which are negatively perceived by developing states. The article also explores Japan's contemporary official development assistance (ODA) policies, which have been changing following the transformation of Japanese security and foreign strategy. Although Tokyo's aid programs in industrial and social spheres are welcomed by developing countries, Japan's pursuit towards the "normalization" of security and foreign policy is still viewed in some of recipient countries with caution. Although the scale of the Republic of Korea's ODA is smaller compared to Japan's and China's foreign aid programs, its implementation has been relatively successful due to interaction between government, businesses and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Whereas in the case of China, rigid control of public activities by the government still hinders comprehensive and multifaceted development of Beijing's assistance policies. Although the peculiarities of China's legislature and political system make its foreign aid policies and practices different from Japan's and Korea's ODA policies, there are a number of common features. These include attention to developing countries' priorities and peculiarities of their economic and political development, the acknowledgment of social responsibility of business, and the growing use of soft power tools. Given these circumstances, the collaboration on ODA projects is possible between China, Japan and the Republic of Korea. However, in some regions where the interests of these countries meet and contradict, for example, in Southeast Asia, there is a growing rivalry between Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul for presence and influence.

DE Russian Orthodox mission; China; first half of the XIX century
AB During a long time from 1713 to 1864 Russian Orthodox mission combined the missionary, educational, diplomatic functions, conducted research and studied the political and economic environment in China. These actions were implemented as the members of the mission, including doctors and students which were assigned to the mission and albazins - the descendants of Cossacks from the captured in 1685 fortress of Albazin. Russian Orthodox mission until 1864, despite its belonging to the Russian Orthodox Church, was under the control of the Asian Department of the Ministry of foreign Affairs. Based on the analysis of numerous archival materials, the author shows that the investigation by the Russian Orthodox mission about the political and economic activities in China helped the Russian government to correct its actions towards China, and contributed to the normalization of cross-cultural relations.

AB This article analyzes the content and approaches to the study of Russian political culture from the standpoint of modern heuristic potential of historical and political sciences presented in the book by Alexander Lukin and Pavel Lukin "Umom Rossiyu ponimat'". The authors - a historian and a political scientist - seek to present an objective and unbiased analysis of post-Soviet Russia political culture phenomenology through a historical retrospective of its such crucial periods, as the history of Novgorod and the Soviet era. One of the authors of the reviewed monograph is a medievalist, specialist on the study of the "West" and speaks European languages having worked in Germany and Eastern Europe; the other author is a political scientist and is committed to the study of the "East," enjoying extensive experience in the studies of the UK, the USA, and China. Their proficiency in different languages, ability to involve a variety of sources and literature, in-depth knowledge of quite dissimilar historical and cultural traditions have helped the authors to complement each other in their desire to look at Russia with as much objectivity as it is possible.

AB In 1930-1931 in the USSR there was instigated a case of all-Union military officer counter-revolutionary organization "Vesna (Spring)" against the former Red army officers. Despite a number of publications, this case remains virtually unstudied. The materials are stored in the Departmental Archive of the Security Service of Ukraine. There were many striking personalities among those arrested in the case of "Spring." Transcripts of the interviews contain valuable data on national military and political history. Many high-ranking military specialist testified in the case of "Spring", some of them instrumental in the creation of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (RKKA); the evidence cover all spheres of the RKKA development from evolution of the high command and history of the military education establishments to evolution of military topography. Some of the persons named in the case having served in the White or national armies, their evidence throws light on the role of officers in the anti-Bolshevistic camp. The evidence is of utmost importance for biographers. The article assesses the nature of investigatory records as an important source on the history of Russian officer corps in the post-revolutionary period. The materials of the "Spring" case speak of a crackdown due to Soviet leadership holding course for building-up of industrial power and eliminating all manifestations of dissent.

TI ONCE AGAIN ON ETHICS OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS

LA Russian
DT Article
DE academic paper; academic publication ethics; original text; citation;
   self-citation; bibliometric indices
AB Over the past few years, a lot of publications by Russian authors have been devoted to assessment of the quality of scientific publications - as a rule, with the focus on bibliometric indices that arc calculated on the basis of the number of scientist's publications and the number of their citations. Such emphasis is, on the one hand, based on the relative novelty of the widespread use of bibliometric indices in the Russian academic community; on the other hand, on the fact that these indices have acquired the status of one of the main and sometimes the only criterion for assessing the contribution to science and the quality of work of individual scientists, research teams and entire academic institutions. Due to this fact, little attention was paid to other aspects of the preparation of manuscripts for publication, such as correctness of citation, peer review process, interaction with editors. Such underestimation of their significance is fraught with decline m the quality of scientific publications. Understanding of scientific ethics is of particular importance for young researchers. These factors led to organization of a large event: in February 2016, the round table "Ethics of Scientific Publications" was held at the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Representatives and chief editors of the leading sociological and political science journals took part in the event. Agenda of the round table included relevant problems of academic publishing, such as ethical issues of interaction between authors, editors and reviewers, rules of citation, rules of assessment of the originality of scholarly texts, reprints of articles, and feasibility of signing an author's contract M a printed form. After discussing the question of the criteria of originality of the scientific text, the audience came to the conclusion that the degree of originality is determined by whether the article contributes to the scholarly knowledge: it should either outline some new propositions and conclusions or offer a different approach to representation of the material. The experts agreed that bibliography of academic paper should include only the sources used in the process of its preparation. The editors unanimously stated that improper citation cannot be allowed in any form, while it is the author of the manuscript (and not the editorial team) who guarantees the credibility of used data and accuracy of citation. Considerable attention was paid to the issue of ethical standards related to the publication of the article in the Internet. The participants drew attention to the fact that publication of the article metadata is possible without any restrictions, while the publication of its full text requires a mandatory consent of the editors. The editors exchanged a number of their knowhow: for instance, it was suggested that authors should submit their manuscripts along with a "passport" of their study, which includes additional information on it and facilitates work of editors and peer reviewers.

TI THE TERM OF THE "TATAR-MONGOLS/MONGOL-TATARS": THE ETHNIC OR POLITICAL

LA Russian
DT Editorial Material
DE Mongols; Mongol-Tatars; Tatars; Kimaks; Uighurs; Naimans; Merkits;
   Medieval Tatar ethnos; Turkic (Tatar) - Mongol period of history
AB In recent years, researchers have begun to pay greater attention to the ethnic aspects of the Great Mongolian State's formation at the turn of the 12th-13th centuries. However, a key problem of this period still remains controversial. This problem is related to the definition of ethnicity of the Tatar and other kindred clans. This article analyzes the problem in order to achieve a clear understanding of the ethnic situation in Central Asia during the formation of Eke Mongol Ulus. As a result of consideration of historiographical approaches to ethnic nomenclature, which the Mongolian and Chinese sources used with respect to the Turkic and Mongolian groups that settled in this area, the author is inclined to the view of Turkish ethnicity of the Tatars and some other (Naimans, Merkits) clans known by source, whom Chinggis Khan faced in the process of formation of the "people of the Mongols". At the same time, the author establishes a historical connection between the preMongol Tartars and Kimak and Uyghur khaganates. In particular, he reveals their affiliation to the elite, "royal" layers of these Turkic states. In turn, this allows us to reveal the presence of a Tatar component among the eastern Kipchak-Kimaks (Yemeks) with close ties with the last dynasty of Khwarezm shahs. On the basis of a detailed and comprehensive review of material, the author points to the need for a new understanding of the term "Mongol-Tatars". This term was not imposed by the Chinese officials, but it was a meaningful politonym marking a two-part (Turkic (Tatar) - Mongol) nature of the "people" who established the Great Mongol Empire. The author informs in his article about his plans to consider in detail this issue in relation to the ulus of Jochi.

The article seeks to identify major trends in evolution of the U.S. science policy and the reasons behind relative decline of the level of budget support of the scientific research. The author studies evolution of the policies of George Bush and Barack Obama, as well as the views of Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The article also examines the input into the federal policy of the governmental bodies, which are directly responsible for its implementation, as well as non-governmental organizations, which seek to advocate interests of scientists; it studies rising competition between the executive authorities and legislators for the recognition as a major champion of the academic community as well as American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

DE European Parliament; European political groups; preferences in coalition
   formation; power indices; power distribution; voting power; voting with
   quota
AB The author analyzes the power distribution among political groups in the European Parliament from 1979 till 2014. Agent's voting power is treated as the capability to influence the result of collective decision-making process. Often the voting power is not equal to votes share the agent possess. We obtain the values of classical and modified power indices for European political groups and compare their performance. The Banzhaf power index is employed to measure European political groups' a priori power that does not impose any restrictions on coalition formation, and power indices that take into account groups' preferences in coalition formation in order to measure actual voting power. Classical power indices 60 are calculated using only votes' distribution in the committee and a quota to pass a decision. Pairwise preferences allow to have respect to different willingness of groups to form a single coalition. In this paper preferences are modeled using the roll-call data from the votings on important issues of European politics. The less popular is the MP's position, the smaller is the number of coalitions she can enter and the less is the voting power. We demonstrate that factions can exploit their position and acquire higher relative power than both share of seats and the Banzhaf index measures, and the Liberal group of the European Parliament forming coalitions with both partners from the left and the right is the case. Conversely, hard restrictions on formation of coalitions due to ideological differences can lead to less actual voting power than a priori.

DT Article
DE political philosophy; history of Russia; civilization; barbarism;
   empire; freedom; revolution
AB The claim this paper makes is that the The Bronze Horseman (1833), poem by Alexandre Pushkin, is not only one of the crowning achievements of Russian literature, but of Russian political philosophy as well. As it is well known, one of the protagonists of the poem is river Neva and the flood restrained by the Bronze Horseman, Pushkin's incarnation of Peter the Great. The author puts forward the hypothesis that the The Bronze Horseman could be conceived by the poet in terms of the treatise of Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince (1513), the centrepiece of the respective system of notions being the figure of the 'prince' who overpowers the barbarous masses, depicted by Machiavelli through the metaphor of an uncontrollable destructive torrent. It may further be supposed that The Bronze Horseman is in a certain sense Pushkin's response to the criticism from his once friend, the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz who had dealt with the ideas of Machiavelli (an important authority in Polish Catholic tradition) in his work. During his stay in Russia in 1824-1829 Mickiewicz met Pushkin in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg many times and developed a friendship with him. One of the most significant encounters took place by the Bronze Horseman on the Senate Square and was subsequently described by Mickiewicz in his short poem entitled Monument to Peter the Great. After the suppression of the Polish revolt of 1830-1831 Mickiewicz remained outraged by the position of his 'former Russian friend Pushkin' who celebrated the 'capture of Warsaw' in enthusiastic verse.

AB The article is devoted to the transformation of the energy strategy of Russia in the conditions of the current economic crisis. The special attention is paid to current trends in the sphere of international relations having a decisive influence on the formation of Russia's energy strategy. The authors point to the crisis of the modern world, the deepening of interstate contradictions, the expansion of confrontation, the revision of the uniform principles of trade, established by the World Trade Organization, the changes in the global financial system. The authors investigate the possibility of political arrangements between the leading suppliers of oil on the destabilization of the oil market in order to achieve geopolitical goals. In the article special attention is also paid to the issue of political motivation of anti-Russian sanctions directed at impeding Russia's development and its Fuel & Energy Complex, in particular. Today, against the background of the current political situation, the energy strategy of Russia is exposed to adjustment. The country has the important task of ensuring technological independence of the energy sector on the basis of import substitution of the equipment, diversification of the directions of export of energy resources, preservation of leading positions in the world market of peaceful nuclear energy, etc. The authors conclude that the energy strategy of Russia is important part of foreign policy strategy of the country, and it is focused on practical cooperation with all countries and is aimed at protecting interests of the state.

AB In March 2012 President Putin put forward the idea of hikiwake (a judo term meaning that no side gets any gain). This principle could serve as a means of conducting political Russian-Japanese dialogue on the "Nothern Territories" issue settlement that might evolve into further conclusion of a peace treaty. As the author sees it, the above mentioned principle cannot play a decisive part in this matter. And the very concept of hikiwake was put forward to maintain the existing "status quo" with the Japanese side.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE economic science; higher economic education; crisis of Western and
   Russian economic science; crisis of higher economic education; classical
   and neoclassical economics; Marxism; institutionalism;
   neoinstitutionalism
AB The focus of my analysis is on the book by V. Yefimov "Economic Science in Question: Another Methodology, History and Research Practices". Starting from the inability of the overwhelming majority of economist to predict the 2008-2009 world economic crisis, the author justifies a statement on the crisis of the modern economic science. In his opinion, the reason is that economic theory is increasingly breaking away from the reality and instead of its objective analysis and explanation tends to serve the ruling class. Even classical political economy was already biased. Yefimov believes that only institutionalism among the three directions of economic theory (classicism and neoclassicism, Marxism and institutionalism) is not politically motivated. Yet, even this direction is currently experiencing degradation, due to the harmful influence of modern neoinstitutionalism. The crisis of economic theory also affects higher economic education, which is also degrading. The author shows that the crisis of economic science and higher economic education has severe consequences for the entire society. The author proposes the avenues to invigorate economic science and higher education.
   Yefimov builds up his study mainly on the Western countries. In Russia the crisis of economic science is rooted in the Soviet period when economic science was put to serve the Communist party. The issues aggravated in the post-Soviet period, adopting the worst features of western economic science and higher education. This paper demonstrates that the modern economic science in Russia has lost a lot of achievement of Soviet economic science which has a very adverse impact upon its ability to analyze and forecast development of Russian economy, and elaborate sound economic policy.

TI HIP-HOP: YOUTH COUNTER-REVOLUTION CULTURE
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE hip-hop; underground; mainstream; youth; protest
AB This article focuses on hip-hop as a movement of popular culture. The article has two main aims. First, observation and discourse analysis, which will identify the principal tropes and commonalities through which researchers and critics of popular culture construct the unity of their analytical narration and subjects of research. It is argued that the achieved discursive unity (the unity of concepts, subjects or themes) does not allow researchers to capture hip-hop as movement in popular culture in all its diversity and heterogeneity. It is argued that academic researchers and critics of hip-hop culture are trapped in representations of the fundamental differences between "mainstream" and "underground." The article shows that research on this topic is dominated by a kind of narrative scenario shaped in the post-war decades that depicts subculture as growing into a cultural movement with potential for progressive liberation.
   The second task of the article is pragmatic: to show why hip-hop is interesting in the current political circumstances. This questioning allows the author to formulate the following theses: 1) the eclecticism of values and style in mainstream and underground music renders the difference between them irrelevant; 2) the culture of hip-hop, with its aura of the local or the regional, is one of the manifestations of the antimodernization momentum; 3) the masculinity of hip-hop, its racial identity pathos and romanticizing gangsterism are manifestations of young peoples' conservative reaction to rapid transformations of their social milieu; 4) the protest culture of hip-hop differs radically from youth protests against capitalism and bureaucracy of the 1960-1970s, with its pathos of gender and race equality, preaching of love and non-violence.

   of electoral systems; majority systems; proportional systems;

ID SOCIAL CHOICE
AB Introduction: the article analyzes classification of electoral systems. Purpose: to determine essential and minor features of various electoral systems. Methods: general scientific methods (dialectics, analysis and synthesis, abstraction and concretization) and specific scientific methods (formal legal, comparative law, technical legal) are used in the article, special attention being paid to the comparative law and system research methods. Results: the traditional approach to distinguishing between majority and proportional systems has lost its importance. As a result of the development of science and search for the fairest technique, many systems concurrently belong to both kinds. The modern world witnesses the emergence of a lot of hybrid systems possessing features of both majority and proportional systems. They include proportional systems with open lists and semi-proportional systems. Moreover, purely proportional systems are seldom applied. In many countries they are in fact disproportional because of various rules distorting representation of political parties (e.g. a threshold). Some majority systems prove to be minority ones. Conclusions: all electoral systems are subdivided into four groups. These are electoral systems in one-mandate territories, in multi-mandate territories, elections according to party lists and combined ones. The main criterion for their differentiation is a subject structure of elections. It is obvious that all electoral systems are subdivided depending on the person who fights for mandates: candidates individually; lists of candidates who are, as a rule, proposed by parties; candidates and de facto lists of candidates simultaneously; some techniques are used concurrently. Other criteria (mathematical criterion of defining a winner, maintenance of a voice) allow us to subdivide given systems into kinds, being evidence of their minor character.

DT Article
DE US-Russian relations; Russia's image; role of media
AB In the article, the author uses a sociocultural approach to analyze debates in the US press that accompanied "Russian celebrations" in 1813. During the War of 1812, the Federalist opposition to President Madison's administration organized several celebrations of Russia's victories over Napoleon, who was a de facto ally of the USA in its war against England. As a result, harsh debates arose about the relative merits of the Russian nation. Madison's supporters described Russia in extremely critical terms, while the critics of the administration mostly spoke positively of the distant country. For both sides, the Russian victories were just a pretext for formulating their own political views, but by using an image of "the Other," they elaborated and affirmed two major characterizations of Russia: in one view, it was a barbaric and uncivilized country; in the other, a guarantor of liberty and a rapidly developing and freedom-loving nation. The main difference was summarized in a pamphlet publication of correspondence between Robert Harper and Robert Walsh. The article affirms that the level of civilization in Russia was not just used as an argument in domestic polemics, but was determined according to the demands of that polemic.

AB The investigation of threats negatively affecting the state and the development of human resources as well as the varieties of security threats is of particular importance in the theory and practice of personnel security measures. The purpose of the article is to identify and classify the ideas of the main threats to personnel security of the region (the research is carried out on the example of the Irkutsk region). On the basis of the content analysis of Russian regulatory legal acts and scientific publications, external and internal threats to personnel security of the region are highlighted. As a result, the list of threats to personnel security of the region consisting of 37 stands is composed. The political, economic, demographic, social, technical and technological, ecological, legal, ethnocultural forms of threats are demonstrated. The authors came to the conclusion that the internal threats to personnel security of the region (first of all socio-economic) are dominant. An assessment of the urgency and relevance of the threats to the personnel security of the region is given. With the use of the technology of the hierarchical factorial analysis, the types of threats (factors of the lowest level) were identified and their influence on the general level of the urgency of personnel security threats (a factor of the highest level) is estimated. It is revealed that legal threats, as well as threats caused by the low labour potential of the region, have the most significant impact on the estimation of the urgency of threats. The study applies the following analysis methods - a content analysis, the analysis of linear and cross-distribution, hierarchical factor and correlation analysis. The analysis is based on the data of the expert survey conducted in the Irkutsk region (2015. To determine the relationship (coherence) of the expert evaluations, the Kendall's coefficient of concordance is calculated. The received results can be used for studying and identification of the personnel security threats, which are specific for a certain region. They can also be a basis for the forecasting and analysis of the threats to regional personnel security and the development of the methods to respond to them.

AB The article deals with the features of contemporary political development of Serbia, including the main areas of cooperation with the European Union (EU). Since the early 2000s the strategic priority of the country's foreign policy is participation in the European integration process, which is accompanied by support of consistent and pragmatic relations with the other key partners, primarily with Russia. The principle of multi-vector foreign policy has been developed since the first half of the 2010s, but its use is treated with the lack of uniqueness by different social strata and political movements. Mechanisms of acceleration or slowing down the integration process are used by official Brussels depending on the current aims and political conjuncture (for example, to weaken Russian influence in the country and in the region). However, despite the success achieved on the path to the EU accession and the favorable dynamics of negotiation process, the level of support of pro-European policy has been decreasing in Serbian society since the end of the 2000s. The main challenges of the near future, in addition to the growth of euroscepticism, include problems of institutional harmonization with the EU and the compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, the enforcement of the Brussels agreement with Pristina, as well as maintaining of balanced foreign policy.

AB The author believes that the governmental regulation of a society is one of the bases of conservatism. He thinks that the state exists in order to protect society and a person from forcible manifestations and free understanding of personal liberty, from non-state coercion and even violence, from manifestation of egoistical personal and corporate interests. Power of the state considerably increases when it relies on traditions of the past rather than the ideals of the future.
   The conservatism as a political trend historically developed as force fastening a public organism. The author of this article believes that only conservatism possesses the real stabilizing resources capable to consolidate society of modern Russia. The author also recognizes that nowadays government and public institutes make certain efforts for overcoming certain social diseases.
   The continuity and progressiveness of the state and social development define fundamentals of ontology of conservatism as the world outlook and a political trend. The Russian State is still at the stage of transition period. The formation of strong democratic institutes has not yet been completed. One of the main problems is the need for public consolidation. Now only the conservatism has sufficient resources and opportunities for the solution of this problem.

DE Significant Other; macro political identity; symbolic politics;
   political rhetoric; frame; mixed methods; image of the USA; image of
   China
AB The article starts with considering theoretical problems of the concept of the Other that points to the out-group in dialogical (co) relation with which the identity of the Self is constructed. This concept describes a fundamental and manifold phenomena that needs to be specified and classified. The author argues that a solution of theoretical issues about the figure of the Other lays in the field of empirical research. In particular, the issue of "significance" of the Other for constituting the Self could be decided only on the basis of systematic study of social practices that essentially rely on (co) relation with particular out-groups. Political rhetoric could be a good field for study of symbolic functions of the Other and factors that determine its significance. Shared representations of the Other are not only an important element of identity construction but also an instrument of the symbolic politics, i.e. public activity aimed at production and dissemination / intrusion of competing visions of social reality. The article demonstrates how a study of patterns of representation of particular macro political communities allows to assess their relative "significance". Basing on theoretical insights from the literature the author proposes a research method that includes manual coding of the frames of representation of the Other in the context of legitimization of political course with subsequent counting of their frequency added by discourse analysis of each group of frames. This method is tried on the case of comparative analysis of frames of representation of the American and Chinese Others in the rhetoric of the presidents of the Russian Federation (from 2000 to 2015).

AB New forms of manifestations of religious intentions in socio-political space have constituted themselves as markers of transformation in the contemporary socio-political coordinates. Revision of the dominant traditional linear approaches placed the focus of ideological and political discussions about the correspondence of stable and variable, traditional and modern in a religious prism. Emerging new configurations in the public and private spheres mark transformation of the traditional relations between religion, society and the state corresponding to the logic of the project of modernity and the paradigm of secularization and require new interpretation optics. The contours of the new designs are evident in the contexts of new challenges and threats related to global political risks of religious terrorism, loss of monopoly on the description of reality, including moral connotations in the understanding of progress of the principle of secularism, with the increased importance of religious and confessional identity, civilizational, local and personal individual levels, forming the hierarchy of values that determines horizons of public and personal goal setting. The penetration of religious meanings in the political and social reality of various areas, their incorporation into ideological discourses of identity build a wide variety of interpretations in the extreme poles of which is religious outline of internal and external threats to social stability and understanding of religion as a resource of optimization of the political system. Institutional, axiological and ontological projection refracts the religious factor in Russian society in polyvalent and nonlinear ways, reflecting the multidirectional vectors of ongoing transformation. On the basis of sociological data of The Institute of Sociology, RAS, the given article analyzes a number of subjects, reflecting qualitatively new social relationships. The emphasis is on multi-scale conflicts, correlation between the secular and the religious in the coordinates of importance of the democracy attributes and social significance of religion, institutional and value aspects as well as the dominant ideas in the Russian society about the role of Church, religion and religious faith in human life and society. Growing importance of religious factors and religious identities in contemporary conditions, the incorporation of religious meanings in different spheres of society intersect with the needs of ensuring the unity of values and stabilization of the social system, as well as close attention to Russian civilization experience. Despite increased sensitivity of contemporary debates on the tragectory of political practices in Russia, the religious factor could be a factor of social cohesion, determining the search of new forms of relations between the state and religious organizations based on the challenges and needs of society and identifying the need for improving mechanisms and practices of state-confessional relations.

DE innovative development; energy efficiency; business-processes; modeling
AB The issue of seeking the ways of energy efficiency enhancement under the innovative development has come to occupy a prominent place of the Russian economy's management. However, the resolution of the problem under analysis is being restrained, because up to the present point the consideration of the issues of innovative development and the matters of energy efficiency enhancement has been being performed separately. While carrying out the research a hypothesis about their reciprocal influence has been put forward. The calculations have been carried out for its confirmation. The data on functioning of the Russian strategic enterprises in various industries have been used as a source of information for the said calculations' implementation. Only the enterprises, having annual revenue of at least $150 million, tax payments to budgets over $75 million, and the number of employees over 4 thousand people have been included in the analyzed sample. The two groups of indicators, characterizing the effectiveness of innovative activity and energy-saving processes in the enterprise over the past five years have been identified drawing at the instance of the said enterprises. The first group includes indicators that could characterize innovative directionality of the balance of assets' structure, indicators of the non-current assets' renewal and indicators of non-current assets' capital productivity. The second group of indicators has been defined on the basis of energy companies ranking, calculated by "Interfax" international news agency. It includes the enterprise energy efficiency index and the rate of change in the dynamics of energy efficiency. This step has been followed by modeling of a possible relation between the two considered groups of indicators and conducting a correlation analysis aimed at the assessment of the closeness of their connection. As a result of the calculations performed the existence of a correlative dependence between the indicators of innovative activity and energy efficiency has been confirmed. Interpretation of the results of the study undertaken allows to come to the conclusion, that integration of innovative development and energy saving processes could be considered as a major direction of the enterprises' energy efficiency enhancement under the innovative development of the economy.

AB The purpose of this paper is to analyze the new forms of region-building in different parts of the world. Based on the studies of various integration initiatives the contemporary regionalism theory school possesses a wide range of tools for regional space consolidation. The diversity of approaches demonstrates different ways of regional alliances formation and the pluralism of participation forms. The paper examines the features of the new forms of regional integration initiated by regional and world powers. Regional construction runs on different levels and creates the new of world order model. Following regionalism-based approaches paper analysis new features of modern regional projects. Russia also faces the challenge of enduring competition with other regional political and economic actors in the process of region-building. With regard to Russia we structure our analysis around two central questions. First, how Russia is choosing its way of region-building? Second, what challenges it can face while realizing the common space projects. The analysis also focuses on reconsideration of modern theories of regional integration.

AB Xi Jinping keeps concentrating the power in order to weaken the opposition to reforms and overcome the resistance of anti-corruption campaign opponents. In this context, the domestic political tension is growing. The uncharacteristic candor of senior party officials who openly express their dissatisfaction with Xi's policy in Chinese media demonstrates such tension. However, growing dissatisfaction does not create critical threats to Xi' power. Nevertheless, the intensification of political struggle can be expected before the 2017 CPC Congress when Xi will try to surround himself with people of the ministerial level personally loyal to him. The arrangements of the Chinese leadership in the economic sphere defined in the 13th five-year plan of China's socio-economic development are no longer perceived by the business with the same confidence. To the most important elements of the Plan belong the so-called "SupplySide Reform" and "One belt, one road" concept. Details of the "Supply-side Reform" are not yet clear. However, it is possible to assume that its main provisions will be aimed at increasing of the high-quality goods and services supply, as well as at reduction of the excess production facilities capacity. The main mechanism of the Reform implementation will be the fiscal policy - reducing of direct and indirect taxes for private companies that, according to the government's idea, should stimulate investments in innovation and thus increase the output of high-quality and high-tech goods. However, the authorities did not abandon the traditional "troika" of economic growth - investment, consumption, export. During the 13th five-year plan, these three components will retain their function, although the balance will shift in favor of the high-quality and innovative products consumption. The Plan will be implemented in an environment of greater politico-economic uncertainty and unpredictability of the central authorities' decisions consequences. A balance on many critical issues has not yet been found, and seems to be determined "empirically".

TI Female Elite Grave in the Necropolis Luchistoe-2 (Southern Crimea)
SO ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS FROM SCYTHIA TO SIBERIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Taurica; Southern Crimea; Late Scythian culture; elite burial
AB The article is a publication of the Grave 1 excavated in the necropolis of Luchistoe-2, which is so far the only known archaeological site in Southern Crimea with burial structures of the Early Roman period. The article includes suggestions regarding the scale and date of the necropolis, as well as the funerary rite, costume and cultural connections of the society using the burial-ground. It was established that the published grave contained the burial of a woman of high social status (probably a priestess) dated from the late-1st or early-2nd century AD. Analysis of the archaeological material in conjunction with information about the location of the necropolis and data from epigraphic documents and ancient litterary tradition, leads to the conclusion that the burial-ground was located in 'Taurica' - the territory between the Greek polis of Chersonesos and the Bosporan kingdom. It was used by the population, which was designated in the written sources as Scytho-Taurians (Plin. NH., IV, 85-86; Arr. PPE. 30). These peoples were bearers of the so-called Late Scythian archaeological culture and belonged to the sphere of the Bosporan state's cultural influence. This information can be used in further reconstructions of the ethno-political situation in the Crimea in Roman times.

   ANATOMY OF A PROTEST
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA

DT Article
DE First Russian Revolution; student unrest; Russian Social Democratic
   Party; demonstration on 5-6 December 1904
AB The role played by the student movement in the political events of the late 20th-early 21st centuries should encourage researchers to carry out a more detailed analysis of similar events in the preceding century. The student community was one of the actors involved in the modernisation process which ultimately led to the three Russian revolutions. It is important to consider the events that occurred prior to the start of the Russian Revolution in 1905 and to clarify the extent to which the students were instigators of the revolution. Particular attention should be paid to the events that took place on 5-6 December 1904: the mass student demonstrations in Moscow, accompanied by violent clashes with the police. The analysis of police surveillance reports and documents from the Ministry of Education shows that one of the factors motivating the student movement was the propaganda campaign launched by liberal newspapers in connection with the convention of the Provincial Congress and the subsequent 'banquet campaign'. The students were influenced by the mood which then captivated society; they listened to criticisms of the autocratic regime being spread by liberal professors and liberal newspapers. The students were moved by the enthusiasm inherent in youth: they eagerly took up the slogans advanced by the older generation and brought them onto the streets. The underground political parties, the Social Democrats and the Socialist Revolutionaries, had no significant impact on the students. The student movement was mainly spontaneous: the students independently joined the demonstration on 16 October and then made the Socialist Revolutionaries join the demonstration on 5 December. The participation of the SRs made this demonstration aggressive and provocative. The protesters themselves provoked the police to use force; thus, the police responded appropriately. The battles that erupted on the streets of Russia's capitals did not bring any benefits to the struggle for liberal reforms. These clashes were interpreted by Nicholas II as a consequence of the 'policy of trust' and opened the frightening prospect of growing instability. As a result, the unbridled desire of students for reform forced the government to give up the idea of making any changes.

AB Our study is based on new evidences, including those which are not known to the present time in scientific circulation and little-known sources from Khrushchev and Brezhnev funds, the Central Committee of the CPSU, the Council of Ministers of the USSR, the State Planning Committee of the USSR, the State Scientific and Economic Council of the USSR and the State Committee for Science and Technology of the USSR, and also the NATO Archive, allowing to analyze the political and economic institutions that formed the policy of using oil and gas resources in the Soviet economy in the so-called the period of the formation of the system of allocation "oil and gas rents" (the second half of the 1950s - the first half of the 1970s). In the second half of the 1950s - the first half of the 1970s soviet leaders, thanks to geological discoveries, received a large "prize", huge reserves of oil and natural gas in the Volga region, the North of Western Siberia and Central Asia, which they could use to achieve their strategic goals. Soviet leaders could choose three possible strategies - to limit the extraction of oil and gas resources by internal consumption ("gasification"), to recycle resources and export petrochemical materials (the "petrochemical project"), to increase the extraction and export of oil and gas resources ("oil and gas maneuver"). This article challenges mainstream of modern historiography about the single of the strategy of soviet leaders in the use of oil and gas resources in the 1960s - 1970s. In the choice of strategy, a significant role was played by interest groups - planners and ministers, their preferences about the economic value of oil and gas resources for the modernization of the Soviet economy. As oil and gas rents grew, interest groups began to fight ("rag war") for its allocation. In the case of the ''petrochemical project'' strategy in 1957-1964, for the ministers, the benefits of redistributing resources to the chemical industry were not too obvious, and the strategy of exporting hydrocarbon resources was more preferable, which eventually led to the abandonment of the petrochemical project and accelerated the formation of a "resource curse" in the Soviet economy, as gradually the priorities shifted from processing to exporting a crude oil. In the case of the "oil and gas maneuver" strategy for planners and ministers, the benefits of redistributing resources to the oil and gas complex were evident; they received an opportunity to purchase abroad equipment and materials in return. However, the implementation of the "oil and gas maneuver" strategy in 1972-1975 led to the rapid development of the "resource curse" in the Soviet economy and the planners saw no alternative to oil and gas rents as a source for the purchase of raw materials and technologies.

AB The peculiarities of the current stage of cross-sectoral social partnership (hereinafter SMEs) development associated with the emergence of socially oriented NGOs (hereafter SONGOs) and designing new mechanisms of their interaction with the state are discussed. Activities of the Federal program for supporting SONGOs (2010-2015) are described briefly. Namely these activities contributed to creating systemic foundations for the economic conditions fornication for the development of the nonprofit sector and expanding the use of its potential in the social sphere. This Program is an example of a new model of the public-state management (hereafter PSM), where standard state and municipal management are complemented by various forms of public participation, including electronic feedback forms, social control, and a variety of consultation mechanisms. Based on the empirical research data, the regional specific character of innovative mechanisms formation for SMEs is shown, a comparative regional context is outlined, as well as the features of regional Programmes for supporting SONGOs. The analysis of positive dynamics of the SMEs associated with the formation of a SONGOs "service" model is given. Changes in the format of interaction between NGOs and bodies of state power related to the adoption of the law on the NGOs' political activities are outlined, which may limit activity of the non-profit community and reduce the quality of SMEs in the public sphere. To overcome these problems, civil society could promote a policy reform that would strengthen the public-state management, creating an institutional framework for constructive dialogue and partnership.

AB This article develops the current international research examining the role of think tanks and analytical communities in policy making, led by Research Committees of the International Political Science Association "Comparative public policy". In this article the authors propose methodology of analytical communities' policy impact assessment. This methodology is based on the study of International and Russian experience. The Methodology was tested on the example of sectoral centers of scientific and technological forecasting developed currently in Russia. These centers have developed a unique expertise and materials in the field of science, technology and innovation policy. The further development of the centers of scientific and technological forecasting will fill the gap of the lack of expert-analytical support of both public authorities responsible for implementation of STI policy, and scientists engaged in innovative scientific discoveries. An important component of an effective development of the activities of the analytical community is to develop their own autonomy and consolidated action on innovation. The proposed methodology can be applied on a regular basis to assess the effectiveness of the centers of scientific and technological forecasting network, to monitor their activities, and to assess the impact on policy changes of other public policy actors.

ID WORLD; GLOBALIZATION; CITIES
AB The article studies the problem of the local self-government autonomy as regards its controversial political status as being conceived traditionally as being simultaneously included and excluded from state governance system. It is posited that in existent structural conditions that are enforced by state territorial principle of polities making autonomy of local self-government is elusive and states that it can be realized in alternative institutional environment connected with transnational deterritorialization of social processes. The article demonstrates two emerging possibilities of local government evolution. The first alternative is connected with creating other structural environment than the state - an urban network and leads to further autonomization. And the second is the trend to a deeper integration to the state structural order with losing the need for institutional autonomy. Any of these alternatives means that a marginal status of included/excluded institution will be lost. Today we face the process of differentiation of local political unities between two structural poles and this in turn makes it possible to discuss a new emergent field of politics for defining the form of aggregating the territory, political community and power apparatus. States and urban networks represent evolution alternatives and thus the distribution of local units can be conceived as a strategy in competitive process of institutional transformation.

DT Article
DE political science; political science community; political knowledge;
   civil society; Russia
AB The article is a response to the publication by M.E. Karyagin and A.Yu. Sungurov ("Polis. Political Studies". 2016. No. 2). The author attempts to clarify some aspects of the institutional history of the Russian political science and notes that in the last two decades there has been a significant increment of knowledge about the formation of this field of research, starting from the last third of the nineteenth century to the present day. The article highlights the little-known pages of domestic specialists' interaction with the International Political Science Association virtually since its inception. In the middle of the XX century the world political science community developed the set of criteria (that still retain their value) for evaluation of scientific content of political studies in different countries. These studies are marked by the diversity of directions, branches and national configurations, a variety of methodological and methodical approaches to research political phenomena. The author suggests that analysis of the relations of academic and expert communities and the factors of their differentiation and internal demarcation should be conducted not only in terms of "science-practice" or specialization at the academic market on researchers who are involved in science, on the one hand, and teachers employed mainly in the transmission of scientific knowledge, on the other hand, but also on the basis of differences in political and scientific-political views. The article questions the understanding of the object and subject of political science that leads to the logical assumption that a decline of authorities' interest in scientific knowledge about politics makes political science unnecessary or, at best, substituted by practical expert knowledge. In contrast to this position, the hypothesis is proposed about civil society as a possible recipient of scientific and expert knowledge about politics.

AB The article is devoted to the research, teaching activities, and outstanding personality traits of the eminent Russian scientist, Doctor in History, professor, and academician Boris V. Anan'ich. He has conducted deep and comprehensive research of Russian economic and financial history of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, revealed the peculiarities of Russian capitalism, the role of banks in the economic and political development of Russia, the potential of the reformist government. According to Boris V. Anan'ich, Russia could hardly avoid the revolutionary upheavals of the early twentieth century. Boris Vasilievich found the ideological origins of the "people's autocracy theory" and gave it the detailed description. He was able to comprehensively analyse the economic system, political views and public activities of Sergei Witte. Boris V. Anan'ich conducted brilliant historical-source research into the so-called "Academic Case of 1929-1931", which was the basis for the repression of the most prominent Russian historians. Professor Boris Romanov has played a huge role in the fate of Boris V. Anan'ich. Boris Anan'ich in turn has taught a lot of competent and original researchers at St. Petersburg State University and the St. Petersburg Institute of History of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Scientific-pedagogical activity of Boris Vasilievich became a professional and moral school for his disciples and followers. Refs 12.

AB Application of spatial-organizational approach in analysis of etlino-political conflict and identity politics in divided, plural, multiethnic and multiracial hybrid Latin American societies allows to consider etlino-political conflict as a multidimensional and multifaceted phenomenon, as well as to analyze identity politics as one of the priority areas of public domain in the context of globalization, struggle for global collective leadership of Latin America states and for global competitiveness. The Latin American political elites have been actively promoting racial mixing, mythologized ideas of national (civic) unity, racial and ethnic homogeneity, and preferred to prevent ethnic and racial distinctions from appearing in the political discourse and in the official documents. However, the problems of race and ethnicity are still present in the national discourse and in the regional politics. The analysis conducted in the categories of political space of various components of ethno-political conflict in the specific sociocultural and historical conditions of Latin America allowed to identify the general and the particular in the processes of transformation of models of state-territorial structure of the region in the past three decades and in historical perspective, to classify internal and external factors of the development of various transnational political spaces that can alter the established political identities, as well as to promote the formation of new macro-political communities, to comprehend the undergoing processes of decentralization and federalization in many Latin American countries, aimed at strengthening civic nationalism in the context of regionalization on the American continent in general, change in configuration of the modern world order, to evaluate the experience of regional policy in these countries.

ID SCIENCE
AB The paper presents a review of key publications on Transdisciplinarity (TD), the science and the methodology which active contemporary development is caused by growth of human activity in planetary scales (challenges of the Anthropocen). The review has revealed an eclectic enough collection of projects and new structures created mainly for the task of solving of problems of modern socio-economic development and integrative/transdisciplinary education. At the same time, some concrete projects of development of organizational forms and examples of convergence of socially demanded knowledge, appear rather actual. The paper mainly considers the sources that describe the following TD aspects: genesis (from antiquity up to now; conflicts and struggle of interests), ontology (Levels of Reality, their relations with levels of TD), epistemology (criteria of truth, the types of logic, new modes of education), political economy (a science as a form of public work organization) and ethical appliances (a "regulating ideal" thematic, ethical aspects of scientific research). Following the results of the review the author concludes that TD, presumably, is ready to support that direction of socio-economic, civilizational developments which will be supported by resources of stakeholders. The spectrum of possible basic methodological assumptions of the chosen direction can be wide enough: from "moist robot" to "builder of the lucid future with strong spirit". TD does not aspire to create a general theoretical structure, but, appeals of a wider reflexivity, including - "humility", openness for interaction with others methodologies and experts, contextualization of one's own knowledge and readiness to give way to other approaches if they are more adequate to modern challenges.

TI Meshchera as a Point of Political Interaction between Muscovy and the
   Tatar World
SO RUSSIAN HISTORY-HISTOIRE RUSSE
LA English
DT Article
DE Golden Horde; Kasimov Khanate; Muscovy; Tatars; frontier
AB Meshchera (also known in the historiography as the Kasimov Khanate, in diplomatic sources as the Meshcherskiy iurt) played a special, very specific role in the relations between Muscovy and the Tatar Khanates during the fifteenth through sixteenth centuries. As a kind of specific frontier zone, it was situated within Muscovy and the Muscovite grand prince possessed authority over it, but at the same time, it became widely regarded as a Tatar iurt. For instance, in Crimean eyes, it was a iurt of the Girays and the Shirin clan. It became for some Crimean servitors a home-away-from-home, a colony of sorts, where they came to serve a Gireiid dynast and enjoy material support and opportunities for campaigning. Certain of Nur-Daulet's (initially a Crimean, then a Kasimov khan) followers moved back and forth between Meshchersldi Gorodok (the capital of Meshchera) and the Crimea. This Tatar enclave, which served for Muscovite rulers as a pattern for other Tatar enclaves of this type (Kashira, Serpukhov, Zvenigorod, Romanov etc.), became an integral part of the steppe appanage system. Muscovite and Tatar political histories overlapped at this point. Although the Kasimov Khanate was not large in size, it figured very prominently in relations between Muscovy (Russia) and the steppe khanates, such as Kazan and the Crimean, as well as the Great and the Nogay Hordes. It, like other iurts of this sort, often acted as a bridge and arbiter of conflict between Orthodoxy Christians and Muslims. The existence of such Tatar enclaves within Muscovite territory influenced Muscovy's status within the whole of the lands of the later Golden Horde.

   (TTIP); Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP); groups of interests; lobbying;

AB This article contributes to the discussion surrounding involvement of interest groups in the political process on the European and global level. My purpose here is to examine how groups of interest can affect EU's role as a global actor and find out which mode of lobbying regulation could strengthen Europe's position in global governance. In this article, I am trying to bind concepts which at first glance might seem quite remote: groups of interests and global governance. By analyzing Europe's position on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), I argue that European ambitions on international arena are undermined by inner tensions. These tensions are mainly caused by discrepancy in positions of different groups of interest who try to influence the outcome of the political process and, thus, make it less stable and predictable. At the same time, adequate lobbying regulation could increase accountability and transparency and, therefore, help to overcome inconsistencies in EU's position in global governance system. The results suggest that without proper backing from inside actors like business groups and civil society associations the EU will constantly wobble and will not be able to fully achieve its global goals.

TI Exclusion as a Criterion for Selecting Socially Vulnerable Population
   Groups
SO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST
LA Russian
DT Article
DE social exclusion; socially vulnerable groups; the poor; poverty concept;
   social inclusion
ID POVERTY
AB The article considers theoretical aspects of a scientific research "The Mechanisms for Overcoming Mental Barriers of Inclusion of Socially Vulnerable Categories of the Population for the Purpose of Intensifying Modernization in the Regional Community" (RSF grant No. 16-18-00078). The authors analyze the essence of the category of "socially vulnerable groups" from the legal, economic and sociological perspectives. The paper shows that the economic approach that uses the criterion "the level of income and accumulated assets" when defining vulnerable population groups prevails in public administration practice. The legal field of the category based on the economic approach is defined by the concept of "the poor and socially unprotected categories of citizens". With the help of the analysis of theoretical and methodological aspects of this issue, the authors show that these criteria are a necessary but not sufficient condition for classifying the population as being socially vulnerable. Foreign literature associates the phenomenon of vulnerability with the concept of risks, with the possibility of households responding to them and with the likelihood of losing the well-being (poverty theory; research areas related to the means of subsistence, etc.). The asset-based approaches relate vulnerability to the poverty that arises due to lack of access to tangible and intangible assets. Sociological theories presented by the concept of social exclusion pay much attention to the breakdown of social ties as a source of vulnerability. The essence of social exclusion consists in the inability of people to participate in important aspects of social life (in politics, labor markets, education and healthcare, cultural life, etc.) though they have all the rights to do so. The difference between the concepts of exclusion and poverty is manifested in the displacement of emphasis from income inequality to limited access to rights. Social exclusion is characterized by the situation and state of exception that is linked to social status and self-perception of human rights and expressed through the senses of inferiority, anger, fear, despair, depression, shame. The status of social exclusion has many criteria: poverty, limited opportunities for employment and education, lack of access to social and community networks and activities, inability to plan one's own life. The explanatory concept of social exclusion is based on the construction of the attitude toward socially vulnerable layers as the devalued social status. The barrier of social inclusion consists in the formation of a negative image of a representative of this category of the population in the eyes of more secure population groups; and the reason for this phenomenon lies in individual characteristics of an individual: lack of purpose, apathy, laziness, low motivation to labor and training, and bad habits. The prevailing social stereotype contributes to the stratification of entire families, including children, who are in advance deprived of the most important economic, political and cultural resources of society, and have no opportunities for the upward mobility. If no measures are taken to overcome social exclusion, it can lead to the fact that part of the population will fall out of social development and slip into a state of stagnation and complete social dependence. The concept of social inclusion shifts the priorities of state social policy from the allocation of social transfers to actively changing the mindset in society.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE place name; toponym; Yamato; Nihon; Fuji; kami; islands
AB The article investigates the role and place of toponyms in political culture of medieval Japan. Research of place names demands interdisciplinary approach. A toponym can be considered to be a so called hyperlink, having clicked on it you open a never-ending chain of cultural, historical, political, literary images, events and phenomena. The exact localization of an event or phenomenon is of particular importance in the conditions of insular territory, relief features, distribution and stability of animistic beliefs in Japan. A complete address of an event or a phenomenon most often includes toponyms of the province, county, village or some concrete place that almost always allows to discover the specified object on a map. Moreover, the geographical objects once introduced into cultural context become places of worship, sources of inspiration for many generations and are extremely seldom changed. Toponyms are a component of names of deities, names of emperors and members of imperial family. Place names were also important for determining and fixing state borders. In the article we analyze the history, of origin and existence of toponyms, which make the base of political, historical and cultural image of the country: name of the country (Yamato - Nihon), name of the highest mountain (Fuji). Besides, we investigate as an example of an important element of the political and administrative structure of the medieval state the place name of such an object as a territorial barrier (Shirakawa), little known today. Being onomastic on the whole, a toponym keeps stability and invariance, allows to save historical information, to be a time indicator in written culture, i.e. using M. M. Bakhtin's term, to form a chronotope of culture. Bases of Japanese political culture up to the 20th century were geographical determinacy of insular mentality and correlation with the imperial myth. This has defined special attention to place names in Japanese cultural tradition.

AB Well-known is philosophical law: in the development of public relations, role of the subjective factor increases. This law is becoming more tangible, especially in transforming countries. This fully applies to Russia, where the subjective factor proved decisive in the choice of methods of reform, and, above all, their core privatization. As a result, privatization in Russia created new ownership relations. These relations are fundamental; they determine all relations social, political, legal, moral and psychological. They impact the whole social environment of the state. Today's political-economy model was created in the first half of the 1990s, and over the past twenty years has not changed. If modern reformers Den Siaopin, Havel, Mechiar, Balcerowicz have extensive bibliography, the identity of Gaidar remains on the periphery of attention of researchers. On the eve of the 25th anniversary of reform this is difficult to understand.

AB The article describes the characteristics of Japan's dominant party during the period of the "1955 system" (1955-1993). Special attention is drawn to the political technologies used by the ruling Liberal Democratic party in order to retain its dominance while maintaining all democratic procedures, including methods of electoral policies, methods of achieving consensus on the basis of an intra-party balance, image-making technologies by changing the party leadership, technologies of splitting the ranks of the opposition. The author concludes that one of the reasons for the resilience of Japan's dominant party phenomenon is "path dependence', which reproduces the nationwide political model in various historical circumstances.

ID FOOTPRINT
AB The main directions of the state regulation of ecological safety of subsoil use in the present conditions of an impending global ecological crisis are defined. These directions are environmental legislation (EL), ecological monitoring (EM), ecological standardization (ES), environmental impact analysis (EIA) and state environmental review (SER), ecological certification (EC), ecological audit (EA) and state ecological monitoring of rational use and safety of works related to subsoil use (SEM). We identify the problems of institutional capacity for environmentally sustainable development of subsurface resources associated with fragmentation, inconsistency and incompleteness of the specific measures that have been set out in Russian legislation. Elimination of these problems requires the development and adoption of new formal rules. The article justifies the necessity to assess the completeness of institutional capacity based on the greening development of mineral and raw materials potential represented as a primary mineral resources and technogenic deposits. We demonstrate the need to shift from the pollution control policy to the policy aimed at the pollution prevention or, at least, pollution restraint. The research confirms the practicability of the state regulation tools development of ecological safety in the direction of substitution the strict policing and punishment system of subsoil users with policy of financial and economic rewards for those who seek to reduce the anthropogenic impact on the environment.

AB Process of consolidation of the Turkic population of Western Siberia has taken the considerable period of time, actually all the II millennium AD. The territory of a forest-steppe zone of Western Siberia with the population living on her to the middle of the 16th century represented, telling expressed by archaeological terminology, a historical and cultural community. In general for all region it was expressed in a certain proximity of material and spiritual culture with the local options gravitating towards valleys of the large rivers - Tobol, Ishim, Irtysh and Ob. Duration of process of rapprochement of the Turkic population has been caused by several factors. First of all, the significant role in it was played that their resettlement to Western Siberia has dragged on more than one thousand years. Also places of an exit of groups of the Turkic population which varied from the foothills of Altai to Central Asia and the Volga region had considerable value. Actually process of formation of uniform ethnos of the Siberian Tatars has begun with inclusion of a forest-steppe strip of Western Siberia in the Mongolian empire. Archaeological materials of the first half of II millennium AD at all variety of the population of a forest-steppe strip of Western Siberia give us quite steady Turkic background on all key elements of material and spiritual culture. By the time of Western Siberia joining the Moscow kingdom there is a certain unification of economy, which becomes complex - consisting of the appropriating branches - hunting, fishery and collecting and making - cattle breeding and agriculture. Formation of the Siberian khanate stimulated the following step in development of the social and economic relations between the populations of certain regions of a forest-steppe strip of Western Siberia. This state education has united the population at a certain level of development of society, the patrimonial and feudal relations - thereby it has involved all population in uniform organizational system. It has found the reflection in archaeological sites of this time - settlement and funeral complexes, life support systems etc. The Turkic population of Western Siberia under the influence of mainly political events was rather in arranging to the last third of the 16th century, but this process began to develop already in other conditions - after accession of Western Siberia to the Russian state - in the XVII-XIX centuries. The key role in it was played by the Tatar nobility and the moved Muslim population from Central Asia and the Volga region, and a decisive factor - Islamization of all Turkic population.

AB The phenomenon German "conservative revolution" in the Weimar republic is the difficult ideological phenomenon of the German history of the mezhvoenny period. Being on limit of traditional conservatism and right radicalism, in the ideological relation "conservative revolution" in the world outlook and ideological plan developed in line with the main conceptual approaches of the German conservatism of the first half of the XX century: traditionalism, kulturpessimizm and acceptance of spirit of a modernist style. These trends defined ideological and political evolution of various directions of the German conservatism during the specified period: from moderated to its farright forms. Representatives of "conservative revolution" in the teoretiko-methodological concepts in the field of philosophy, culturologists, political science, law carried out quite successful synthesis of various tendencies of the German conservatism 1920 - the 1930th. In ideology of "conservative revolution" national myths of the German history, otrefleksirovanny in the spirit of vitalism and an irrationalism, cultures pessimism and political romanticism situationally connected. Representatives of "conservative revolution" in the teoretiko-methodological concepts in the field of philosophy, culturologists, political science, law carried out quite successful synthesis of various tendencies of the German conservatism 1920 - the 1930th. In ideology of "conservative revolution" national myths of the German history, otrefleksirovanny in the spirit of vitalism and an irrationalism, cultures pessimism and political romanticism situationally connected. But, in too time "conservative revolutionaries" had clear understanding not of opportunity to keep tradition within the doburzhuaznykh of public and economic structures and in this regard they acted as apologists of various versions of "a reactionary modernist style". Therefore, despite the appeal to traditional values, desire to position itself true defenders of the German spirit, "conservative revolutionaries far were beyond tradition. It led to transformation of both the understanding of tradition, and interpretations of its intrinsic signs. On the example of Shpengler, Freier and Yunger's cultural and historical and political concepts the author shows consecutive process of search of possibility of synthesis of traditionalism, kulturpessimizm, modernist style, culture and a civilization through equipment, as the most characteristic expression of a civilization during a modernist style era. The author draws a conclusion that the dichotomy of tradition and the present was comprehended by "conservative revolutionaries" at the new theoretical and practical (political) level: as a problem of preservation of culture and tradition in operating conditions of an industrial civilization. This problem was solved ideologists of "conservative revolution" only in "conservatively revolutionary" a radical key. For them there was no question that the tradition or the present is more preferable, they understood and accepted inevitability of approach of a modern industrial civilization. "conservative revolutionaries" saw the main objective in development of philosophical, political and social projects of synthesis of tradition with an industrial civilization.

AB This article discusses the new monograph by Boris Mironov, "The Russian Empire: From Tradition to Modernity," which is devoted to the social history of Russia in the imperial period. One of its main characteristics is its fundamental interdisciplinarity and the use of various research methods and strategies. Mironov synthesizes the approaches of social, economic, political and visual history, social anthropology, historical demography, sociology, political science and psychology. I. I. Verniaev, an ethnographer by profession, views this book through the eyes of an ethnographer and analyzes it from the perspective of social anthropology. In his opinion, Mironov succeeded in deeply analyzing the principles and technologies of management of ethnic and confessional diversity and the transformation of traditional socio-cultural institutions. The article discusses how Mironov identifies and analyzes such imperial principles and technologies of management of ethno-confessional diversity, modernization, and integration of socio-cultural systems as maintaining the status quo, the relative autonomy of ethnic groups in the early stages of incorporation of the national borderlands, ethnic and religious tolerance, the use of intermediate symbiotic (neo-traditional, in terms of ethnography) institutions, confessionalization, the predominance of social rather than ethnic assimilation, legitimation and the ennoblement of national elites, their inclusion in the system of governance of the empire, the extension and adaptation of the estate system to include new groups of the population from the national borderlands, the confessionalization of religions, and the empowerment of the clergy through rights and responsibilities in the administrative system. These processes are interpreted in terms of models of traditional societies and cultures developed in modern ethnography, and the manner of their modernization and incorporation into modern society.

AB In recent years, the interaction of Russia with several Latin American countries is increasingly determined by the term of strategic partnership, which was enshrined in bilateral inter-State instruments to articulate a more mature and advanced Russian-Latin American cooperation. To date, this type of relationship characterizes the Russia's link with Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua and Ecuador. At the global level, Russia and Latin American States are interested in improving and enhancing the effectiveness of the existing world orders in key areas of security, economic development, monetary and financial cooperation, stabilization of commodities, food and energy markets. The latter became especially relevant in 2014-2015, when there was a collapse in world prices of many products of Russian and Latin American exports. Strategic partnership at its core, is a complex phenomenon, since it covers almost all the key areas of Russian-Latin American cooperation and is not circumstantial but sustained and lasting. The strength of this type of State-to-State relations is determined by a number of factors, but primarily, by the willingness of the parties to take into account the mutual interests and promote their advancement, the presence of active and effective mechanisms for cooperation. Based on the foregoing and formulating the essence of strategic partnerships very succinctly, it can be stated that it is intergovernmental cooperation, which without the hard Allied ligaments and uncomfortable mutual obligations provides partners the opportunity to merge. For Moscow, the formation of a strategic partnership with Latin America is an integral part of modern mega strategy, aimed at enhancing the quality of economic and political positions of Russia in the global world.

   of forces; sovereignty; world and regional leadership; "world disorder";

AB The article is dedicated to the subject practically missed by the modern science - the problem of the world order transition to new structures taking place in history, and relevant regularities. The "transitional period" in world politics is regarded as a reversal of principles which formed the base of the past international relations system that has lost its efficiency and utility. Transitional periods are analyzed with reference to alternative ways of changing the international relations system functioning principles. The modern transition of world development and problems of the Russian Federation under new conditions are studied from the political-scientific point of view. The question when the present-day chaos (typical of a transitional period) ends, and the new world order lineaments take shape, is still open. The author presumes that the "new world disorder" may be considered the initial stage of the Forth World War (regarding the Cold War as the Third World War). The establishment of the new world order would now take other forms than it did in the past. In real politics, the global sustainable and safe development issues have paled into insignificance. Coming around to them could only be possible in the long term, and even if definite conditions are met. Global powers should adjust to new realities: the U.S. must stop regarding other countries as "junior" partners or opponents; China is to withdraw from its policy of reckoning only its own prosperity interests; Russia should show more leniency and understanding towards the political course of the European Union states.

AB The article examines the new realities of Russia's foreign policy after the "Arab Spring" and the potential for increased Russian influence in the Maghreb. One of the consequences of the recent political upheavals in North Africa is the growth of terrorist threat - this factor draws particular attention to this region. The Maghreb is important for the promotion of Russian interests in the Arab world and the African continent. Russia and North Africa are seeking strategic cooperation, and these countries have long-term friendship and mutual interests in the political and economic spheres. Further increase of the interaction will strengthen bilateral relations, will make it easier to survive during the political and economic crisis. The article analyzes the formation, the current state and prospects of Russian-Algerian, Moroccan-Russian and Russian-Tunisian relations. Algeria is one of the leading economic partners of Russia on the African continent. The main areas of bilateral cooperation are the energy and military spheres. The growth of the terrorist threat in the Sahara-Sahel region prompted Russia and Morocco to deepen security cooperation. In the context of EU economic sanctions against Russia a priority in Russian-Tunisian and Russian-Moroccan trade relations is to enhance cooperation in the field of agriculture. Russia is a traditional exporter of Moroccan oranges and Tunisian olive oil. Promising areas of cooperation of Russia and Tunisia are the development of water resources and hydraulic engineering, infrastructure projects in the field of construction of roads, bridges, industrial facilities. Expansion of ties with the North African countries will allow Russia to increase influence in the region.

DE conceivable and possible; a priori and a posteriori; nature of logic and

   argument; two-dimensional semantics
AB The article discusses the question of a ratio conceivable and possible. The proposed solution is in recognition of an inevitable divergence between what can be conceivable as possible and what is possible actually. This rupture of conceivable and possible is explained by existing limits of human intellect. The limits of human intellect can be expressed in categories of J. Hintikka who considers the sphere of logical through a prism of epistemic agent with limited information, and divides in this regard surface information and depth information. In the context of the epistemic agent with limited information transition from conceivable to logically possible, used in modal arguments of various type is wrong. In article criticized the zombie argument of D. Chalmers as an example of a similar mistake. The idea of the impossible possible worlds (Hintikka) is interpreted by the author in a spirit the necessity of selection special, not actually existing objects which inevitably (similarly transcendental illusion of Kant) designed by the finite epistemic agent at the level of superficial information. The idea of depth information is interpreted in the context of classical concept of infinite intellect, and also through differentiation of truth of the reason and truth of the fact (G. Leibniz). The question of the special substantial a priori determined by semantics of language is also raised in article. The idea of similar semantic a priori seems to the author more perspective, than classical idea of synthetic a priori (I. Kant). That idea also is attracted for an explanation of the nature of mathematics and philosophy. In this regard there is an interpretation of logic and mathematics as tools of the finite epistemic agent. Instrumental interpretation allows us to consider the logic and math independently of normative or descriptive functions. The article discusses the necessary connection of semantics of the possible worlds with ontological (or metaphysical) postulates which is generated by the fact that the universe of the possible worlds is determined by conceptual means of the accepted language and therefore depends on its conceptual a priori. Division of the Chalmers primary and secondary intensional criticized as the division which is not considering a role of the epistemic agent. In view of the finiteness of the knower, it becomes problematic a concept of "primary intensional", and after it should be revised the idea of two-level semantics as dependent on ontological prerequisites of some language.

DE Maidan; revolution; take-over; Russia; the Ukraine
AB The possibility of repetitions of the Ukrainian events of 2013-2014 in today's Russia is considered in the article. The analysis is based on detecting factors, which had effect on the process of realization of the Ukrainian revolution and on their comparison with the contemporary conditions. It is noted in the beginning of the article that the question itself bears rather polemical character and in the modern period the results of any sociological studies do not allow us forecasting such events in foreseeable future. Alongside with that the statements of opposition spokesmen, experts, journalists, statesmen and public officials of the Russian Federation about the potential danger of such progression of events and, in certain cases about theirs impendence, allow us to regard this problem as topical. The analysis of "the Revolution of Dignity" has helped us to determine several factors, which conditioned such an extreme way of transformation. The factors having effect on the macro level were the geography of the country, the history of the state formation, problems of the state structure (corruption, inequality, elective justice, the existence of oligarchic system, etc.), policy elite dysfunctionality; specific nature of the political institutions (including cultural aspect). The middle level are the factors, which had determined and predetermined the events of 2014: disenchantment of the overwhelming majority of citizens with the policy carried out, lack of support of the government acting at the time on the part of the main "players", intervention of foreign countries into the internal affairs of the Ukraine, as well as the role of mass media. Therefore, we can arrive at the conclusion that the Ukrainian revolution became the result of the system-related crisis phenomena of the Ukrainian society and state. Using the opportunity of the situation different inside and outside forces managed to become more active and execute the plan for the toppling of the legitimately elected president. Mass media also played a discrete role in the transformation of the citizens' discontentment into revolution activity. If we compare the above described situation with the situation in today's Russian society, we will be able to see similar problems. Those are, in particular, the problems of the political and economic systems of the state. Different situations, which can provoke discontentment and can be used for initiating rebellion activity (rules and acts regarding road and cars, several acts regarding the use of Internet, etc., which are unpopular among the majority of the country's citizens) are revealed. Totally, we can make a conclusion of the existence of different preconditions for initiating of revolutionary (protest) actions.

AB Reducing of Russia's political, military and economic presence in Asia-Pacific region, associated with the collapse of the USSR and the bipolar system of international relations, considerably weakened the degree of its cultural influence in the region. As a result, of the deep crisis in the political, economic and social life experienced by our country in the last decade of the twentieth century, Russia has practically lost its status as a world superpower, especially among former Soviet allies in the socialist bloc (China, Korea, India, Vietnam, Laos, Mongolia). Unattractiveness of foreign policy, national economy, inefficiency of the reforms, unfavorable investment climate, high levels of bureaucracy and criminalization of society, corruption of power, imperfect system of Russian legislation, unformed institutions of civil society have had a negative impact on our country's image in the world community assessments. However, now it has become quite obvious that the role of "soft power" instruments in world politics grows increasingly, resulting in the issue of Russia's cultural presence renewal in the world and, particularly in Asia-Pacific region is becoming one of the most important national interests of the country's foreign policy. In this regard, there is a need for intensification of integration processes in the sphere of humanitarian cooperation (science, education, culture, tourism, language, media, youth policy), between Russia and Asia Pacific countries. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of Russian "soft power" instruments in Russia's foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific region. The paper analyzes the factors and conditions for increasing humanitarian and cultural presence of Russia in the world, the recent initiatives and decisions of Russian government, as well as measures of state support in terms of the development of cultural diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region. The key challenges and the prospects for further activity in this direction are identified.

AB The article is devoted to an analysis of the state management role in a national brand strategy forming. A communicative branding model should have a basis as a central theme, which has a significant value for the citizens and for the international actors. In the article is viewed that the Russian national brand identity is defined by the key idea of the strong defensible state. Therefore, defense industry can be object field for national branding strategy forming. As a result branding communication may become a national unity basis and an effective state positioning. National branding strategy should be include in the internal and external political conjecture. The military-political crisis in Ukraine, participation of Russia in the military operations in Syria and an increased international terrorism threat actualize political values of national safety. Consequently the theme of the state defense ability could become the national brand identity.
   So the state as a key actor of the national branding strategy should act system-oriented and elaborately. There is a lot of innovation instruments for the support of innovation actors in defense industry: technological platforms, innovation territorial clusters, federal target programs, state funds etc. The optimal set of these instruments provide innovation potential of the actors in defense industry. So the system of supporting defense enterprises and universities is constructed. Innovation defense enterprises and universities using the innovation instruments form innovation territory potential, territory brands. Innovation belts formed with participation of the defense industry innovation subjects providing for the state safety promote a territorial and national branding. So the sum of territory brands form the national brand of the strong state. Communication representation of defense innovators collaboration and its results provides a sense filling of the national branding strategy. Communication branding policy is directed to the innovation policy support in the defense industry and its representation to the target groups. As a result an effective national branding of Russia brings the global competitiveness and international state influence strengthening.

DE socio-anthropological sense in science; non-scientific knowledge;
   quasi-science; fraud in science; ideologized science
AB In non-scientific knowledge one can distinguish such kinds of knowledge as extrascientific, unscientific (being inside science and called quasiscientific) and non-scientific one concentrated around science, which is named parascience or pseudoscientific knowledge. Both quasiscience and pseudoscientific knowledge parasitize on anthropological sense of science: quasiscience simulates sociocultural force, pseudoscientific knowledge tries to imitate science as productive and saving power. Quasiscience is generated as the result of violation of high requirements and norms and ideals of the scientific ethos by some scientists. In such cases violation may be insignificant which generates quasiscience, but in the course of more and more significant deviations from the norms and ideals new kinds of quasiscience appear. Three main types of quasiscience can be singled out. The first type includes works known to be weak in scientific respect and this type can be defined as quasiscientific hack. Spreading of swindling, shobby research and publications provokes further deviation from ideals and norms of scientific investigation and creates a new kind of quasiscience i.e. scientific fraud. Fabrication, falsification and plagiarism are referred to scientific fraud. Under fabrication the creation of a false scientific product is meant. Under falsification the distortion of the scientific product already created by other scientist, distortion of scientific truth and results of scientific experiments or observations is implied. Plagiarism is presentation of the scientific product which has been created by someone else as the scientific product created by the person who presents it at the moment. Quasiscience which begins to be supported by public authorities is evolving into the third type of such phenomenon and becomes ideologised science. In ideologised science quasiscientific hack and quasiscientific fraud receive state justification and quasiscience itself is transformed in pseudoscientific knowledge.

DE epistemology of introspection; introspection; phenomenal belief;
   phenomenal concept; the accuracy of introspection
AB The aim of this article is to criticize David Chalmers' incorrigibility thesis, which holds that a direct phenomenal belief cannot be false. In order to maintain his claim, Chalmers distinguishes three types of phenomenal concepts - relational phenomenal concepts, demonstrative phenomenal concepts and pure phenomenal concepts. According to Chalmers, pure phenomenal concepts do not pick out phenomenal properties relationally or indexically as do relational phenomenal concepts and demonstrative phenomenal concepts. Instead, they pick them out directly, in terms of their intrinsic phenomenal nature. Chalmers also distinguishes two subtypes of pure phenomenal concepts - direct phenomenal concepts and standing phenomenal concepts. Direct phenomenal concepts, which underlie direct phenomenal beliefs, can be formed by a subject only in presence of an object with phenomenal properties and only if she directs her attention to them. Standing phenomenal concepts can be formed by memory. Chalmers assumes that direct phenomenal concepts can be described as phenomenal concepts, which are partly constituted by underlying phenomenal qualities. He also insists on the existence of a special intimate connection between a direct phenomenal concept and its content - the phenomenal quality. This specific intimate connection makes the phenomenal concept's representation of its content incorrigibly accurate. Moreover he describes the introspective access to a direct phenomenal belief (at heart of which there is a direct phenomenal concept) as an immediate, non-relational connection, which he names by the Russellian term "acquaintance." First, the article tries to show that] the idea of there being a special connection between direct phenomenal concepts and phenomenal properties, along with the idea of acquaintance, makes Chalmers' incorrigibility thesis weak, for these two ideas remain unexplained in his current description of this thesis. Moreover, because of their mysterious meaning, they most likely cannot be explained in the future. Second the article points out that the specific immediate connection between direct phenomenal concepts and phenomenal properties seems inexplicable, because of the meaning of the word "concept," which presupposes that any concept relational or not - picks out only certain features of the object and cannot grasp all its details. Third, the article challenges the incorrigible accuracy of the representation of content in direct phenomenal concepts in the light of modern theories of consciousness, according to which phenomenal experience is illusory. Finally the article draws attention to the fact that even if direct phenomenal beliefs are indeed incorrigible, it remains unclear how they can enrich philosophical and psychological studies of consciousness as long as their content is so private. The first objection is, I think, the most serious one.

The search for God was mixed and affected many Russian philosophers. One of them was Merezhkovsky, who offered in return to Orthodoxy of the new religion of the Third Testament. In the formulation of her ideas, he started from solovievsky idea of God-manhood, and the basic tenets of the spirit and the flesh, sex, "Holy flesh" tested in the trilogy "Christ and Antichrist", the essay "Mystery of Three" and "Coming ham". The efforts of Merezhkovsky and his associates Z. Gippius and D.

AB Despite the dominance of the commodity sector in the regional economy, many experts expressed the need to transition to an innovative development. Such transformation contributes to the modernization of both the regions and the country as a whole. In this sense, Tomsk is a good example of how science and education can contribute to town formation. Development and introduction of high technologies are taking place in the framework of a special economic zone, which is also sometimes known as Techno-innovation Zone (TZ). Such zone has been functioning in Tomsk already for more than 10 years. This article attempts to examine the impact it has on the development of Tomsk and the region as a whole. Moreover, it tries to assess innovative development of the region via the introduction of the high-tech technologies as viewed by the scientific elite of the city. Research has shown that the functioning of the special economic zone had a positive impact on the development of the region. For instance, modern technological platform was set up in Tomsk. It hosts all city's high-impact companies. The emergence of TZ gave an impetus for the construction of roads and new routes. Last but not least it strengthened the image of Tomsk being as one of the innovative centers of Siberia. At the same time, there are a number of threats, hindering the neo-industrialization of the economy. These include factors such as a small fraction of the innovative developments being introduced in production, diverging opinions of the scientific and business communities, copyrights violations, low investment, and inadequate infrastructure. Nevertheless, Tomsk has an opportunity to strengthen its position among the innovative cities, by focusing on the introduction of high-tech developments. Also, it is very important to give due attention to the quality of innovation policy and investment climate, as well as the creation of social and economic conditions for conducting innovative activities by developing urban environment. Implementation of the above conditions will create the necessary prerequisites for the development of human and cultural capital, in other words - creative professionals, who lie at the core of the innovation economy and are able to work in the field of high-tech production.

DE Foucault's philosophy; episteme; structuralism; ontology
AB The paper considers the notion of Foucault's episteme in his "Order of things." Even if Foucault himself has abandoned the notion of "episteme" for other concepts such the "archive", "discourse" or "dispositive", it remains one of the most important methodological points in his intellectual biography. If we consider Foucault as a philosopher, we have to analyze how Foucault dialogizes or polemicizes with eminent philosophical movements of his time: phenomenology, existentialism, marxism. We have to take in consideration the most influential Foucault's commentators, ex. g.:E. Balibar, B.Han, G.Le Brun, G. Canguilhem, J.-G. Merquoir. The archeology of Foucault contests a long humanistic tradition that postulates the common nature of human being and the continuity of rational knowledge. Not only romantics or positivist thinkers, but even a materialist philosopher like Marx was, admitted an emancipation of human being and an accumulation of knowledge as a real background of progress. Our aim is to prove that the episteme notion is not only deconstructive one but contains a mighty potential to demonstrate fundamental structures of thought, history and being. Firstly, it is not occasionally that for discovering episteme Foucault explores sciences about language, economy and life and not mathematics or physics. It proves that these sciences have to do with particular historical reality. Secondly Foucault considers philosophical theories as epiphenomena of episteme. So the episteme has a particular ontological status, it is a priori and necessary; it is a complex conscious and subconscious structure of practices, institutions and knowledge. The very center of Foucault's archeological epistemology is the classical episteme. In this point the Foucault's work has much in common with the Heidegger's "Age of the World Picture". Another question is about the succession of epistemes. Foucault distinguished three epistemes: the pre-classical, classical and modern ("anthropocentrical") ones. It is possible to see how the epistemological discontinuities work at the empirical level. The applied sciences often meet difficulties to think the reasons of structural changes and cannot explain why they abandon an idea for another one. The actual difficulties to re-think the human and social sciences seem to due to this discontinue character of knowledge, as Foucault wrote.

DE the ideal language; the natural language; the interpretation; of

AB This article presents a study model of a ideal language in analytic philosophy. The author of the article is based on a study of V. A. Ladov "Formal realism", which presents two concepts - realism and antirealism, within which is formed the model of an ideal language. Realism is formed by creating a particular ontological model, characterized by the creation of concepts, singular terms that characterize reality. Antirealism presents an ideal model of the language, aiming at the demonstration of the constant change of the values of an expression, depending on the time and place of the events. The language model G. Frege characterized by establishing certain true concepts that reflect the thinking process. The model of an ideal language B. Russell expressed by means of the theory of descriptions and the formation of concepts aimed at the full description and the knowledge of reality. Language model W. Sellars is characterized by the creation of concepts, expressing nouns, adjectives, aimed at a clear description of reality. P. Stroson builds grammatical theory is not only through the formation of concepts, but also by creating categories that express communication, relationships, transitions, reflecting reality. The ideal model of language use P. Grice is characterized by constant change in the value of an expression that depends on the perception and place of the events. All the studied representatives of analytical philosophy: G. Frege, B. Russell, W. Sellars, P. Strowson, P. Grice expressed the ideal model of language claiming that logic is in any case should not be divorced from reality, and can be the basis for building a system of concepts, categories, specific terms, to all changes and processes occurring in the material world. These ideas are presented in the article, under the concepts of realism and antirealism.

DE Aristotle; essentialism; semantic theory; Kripke; Putnam
AB A certain tendency can be spotted in the English-speaking philosophical community - predominantly (but not exclusively) among ancient philosophy scholars - in the last few decades. It is a tendency to compare certain traits of Aristotle's philosophy with the semantic theories of certain modern analytics philosophers -mainly with those ones of Sual Kripke and Hillary Putnam. The subjects under comparison are "essentialism" and certain elements of "semantic theory" of Aristotle and the semantic theories of Putnam and Kripke. Comparing those scholars find surprisingly large number of similar traits - starting with the thesis, that essences of the certain objects, though being necessary, are discovered in course of scientific investigation and in certain cases all the way to the "linguistic division of labor". But how valuable such comparisons really are? To answer that we have to turn to the question of for what purposes comparison of two theories can be performed at all. We can compare two theories to track a historical influence of the earlier to the later - but that is obviously not the case with the theories under question, as they are not connected in any such way. We can further use the earlier theory that is more familiar and more clear to as a means of understanding a later and a less intelligible; but that in not the case as well in our case, as the theory in question of Aristotle, being fragmentary, not easy to follow and overall convoluted, is much less intelligible than those of Kripke and Putnam. Finally we can on contrary try to elucidate the earlier convoluted theory by the comparing it to the later and intelligible one; however if there is no real historical connection between them (and in our case there is not) we have no right to do that, as we would be forcing the problematic of the later theory on the earlier one with no ground for doing that whatsoever. Therefore I come to the conclusion that this kind of comparisons can not be counted among theoretically valuable ones: it can be curious and quite entertaining, but it can hardly help us to understand either of the theories in question.

DE traveling; homecoming; self-transcendence; originality; personality
   traveler; travel philosophy
AB In previous articles it was offered to combine different types of traveling - all possible means of travel for a human in the physical real world ("external" geographical) and in "internal" space of his personality - into term Travel. If Novelty is the main value and one of the true Travel's criteria, then its other features are awareness and voluntary fulfillment of the "external" and "internal" journeys; Traveler's ability to self-transcendence; his aspiration and opportunity to eventually return back (to society, to birthplace, to everyday reality, to Self); Traveler's creation of a "product" (further Product) produced after the completion of Travel and based on the experience obtained there. It is at this stage of the Return occurs the creation of a Product - a certain proof and creative and creative outcome of committed Travel.
   At the beginning of the Return's stage Traveler gets over adaptation to the world of everyday reality and changes inside Himself that have occurred to him after meeting with Novelty. Only after a break, during which Travel took place, and exclusively on the contrast with everymen who live within four walls, it is possible to perceive Novelty, which came into Traveler's life and his personality. During this period of time Traveler's Self is highly diffused and his personality is depersonalized, transpersonalized and partially marginalized. Current stage in the Return's process called "transit", "liminality" (A. van Gennep). Cultivation of new realities, means and structures at this stage will allow to "give birth" to Self in the skin of Novelty, particularly compile any variation of Self which looks most relevant at this phase of personality existence and congruent to its experience gained in the Traveling. By the time of Product's creation, Traveler's personality ultimately gains socially acceptable outlines and he gets a formed image of the world and Himself. Further, Traveler dives into the process of reflection on the topic of his Traveling to firstly realize its meaning and value for Himself and then share with others his conclusions via Product which is presented to society in a plain language or metalanguage of characters-sounds-codes (in case of artworks). Without the presence of the Product, we cannot consider what happened to the man as Travel and we cannot call him a Traveler as his personal experience and impressions in this case stay deeply internal and a Travel is an event out of personal life. And of course the general stage which can be called as Return includes phase which completely finalizes a previous Travel and begins a new one: building plans for future geographic journeys and apprehend interesting "internal" routes. In total we derive three main phases of the stage Return: Homecoming, Product creation and new Travel planning-apprehanding.

AB Considering Siberia a specific macro-region of the Russian periphery, the author strives to show the impact of historical Slavic studies on the development of its scientific and educational potential, the main regional socio-political and socio-cultural institutions and processes. Traditionally Siberian higher educational institutions were not among the centres of Russian historical Slavic studies due to their peripheral geographical location and administrative specificity. However, they played a very important role in these processes. The historical Slavic studies influenced some regional and sectoral institutions. The Slavic studies in the academic environment of the national high school, including Siberia, had a bidirectional effect. On the one hand, it was the state policy aimed at solving the most important domestic and geopolitical issues (e.g. promotion of the idea of Slavic brotherhood and the unity of Slavic peoples who have common history and cultural identity). On the other hand, the initiative on part of the high school employees in Siberia contributed much to the development of historical Slavic studies, especially in such peripheral regions as Siberia.
   The article is based on new archival sources and materials found by the author in Siberian archives and introduced into the scientific discourse for the first time.

DE epistemology; logic; Plato; relativism; truth; paradox; self-reference;

AB For the first time the classical argument against relativism was formulated by Plato in "Theaetetus". The argument was repeated more than once in history of philosophy. However, the argument was mostly represented to be naive from a logical point of view. It was built on the foundation of latent admission of consistent semantically closed language. Existence of the language was rejected by orthodox conceptions in the 20th century logic (Russell's theory of types and Tarski's semantic theory of metalanguages). These conceptions allowed to solve the problem of logical paradoxes. Therefore, to recognize correctness of Plato's epistemological argument it is necessary to analyze orthodox method critically and to present a new solution that would be admit semantically closed language. Author of this article tries to achieve the aim representing the new "ad hoc solution" of logical paradoxes in semantically close language. Thus, epistemological criticism of relativism is found its essential logical justification.

DE deflationism; truth; meaning; reference; liar paradox;
   interchangebility; pragmatism
AB Two alternatives are considered with regards of deflationism and the liar paradox: (1) revisiting of the principles of logic (in particular, in the framework of dialeteism), (2) adding an external pragmatic principle to deflationism. Tarski suggested that the truth definition for a given language should be formulated in the appropriate meta-language that allows one to define semantic concepts of semantically-open languages. In general, this approach can be used within deflationism. Kripke and Hintikka solved the Tarski's problem - the problem of an infinite hierarchy of languages and truth definitions for them, but they did not managed to solve the problem of the liar paradox. One can use the substitution interpretation of quantifiers to solve the problem of liar paradox, but the consequence of it is that strict completeness and compactness become unprovable without special modifications of a given logical system. Field offers to define dialeteism as a point of view, according to which both, sentence and its negation are accepted by a given speaker. In fact, dialeteism can be understood as a special case of the pragmatic variant of deflationary theory of truth. The solution of the paradox of the liar in this case would be complete only when deflationism is accompanied with some external explanation of the conditions under which the speaker is willing to make the substitution according to deflationary scheme. By means of this pragmatic principle we are able to epistemically define the concept of meaning. The problem of solving the liar paradox should be solved not by some particular theory of truth, and by a more general logical or logico-metaphysical theory. Therefore, the liar paradox threatens deflationism only in the cast that a liar paradox solution in a more general theory leads to a revision of the latter, which would no longer be consistent with deflationism.

However, only the coming to power of President Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping is not declarative, but almost literally led to the invasion of science in the Party and the administration of the country, including personnel policy and government decision-making. As a result of this policy, a new Institute of Chinese policy, similar in appearance to some training sessions, but in fact a crucial task, as the intellectual development of senior management, and promotes the transformation of the demands of society in specific solutions, and even transfer them to the specific political program. In the so-called collective training sessions, attended not only by members of the Politburo, but the ministers and the governors of the provinces, and the lecturers are the experts, scholars, researchers of Beijing University and other regions. These sessions solve diverse goals and objectives - the formation of a strategy to link the current problems with the Chinese history and the experiences of other countries, making the practice of collective decision-making contributes to the formation of a unified approach (consensus) among the participants of political and administrative process. Extremely interesting technology of their conduct, which covers selection of topics and research institutions; specific selection of lecturers and development of the texts, which are then handed over to each of those present; regulations; a leading role; The role of media. It is also important functions performed by the sessions - information, symbolic; ideological and propaganda; mobilization and recruitment policy; image production. Subjects discussed questions is always concrete and linked with the test problems of Chinese society. The party leadership and corruption in its ranks; environment, employment and unemployment; development of culture and the Internet; ideology and especially the central idea of "socialism with Chinese characteristics"; "law supremacy"; Marxist philosophy, social and economic sciences. And only a third of the sessions focused on international affairs, but each of them is always designated the national interests of China, its politics and society as a whole. Analyze the experience is not only unique, but also instructive to control the state, including Russia.

DE hidden indexicals; mode of presentation; notion; description; reference
AB In the spotlight of the semantics of belief contexts is the problem that in these contexts the substitutivity of identity principle is violated. One of the theories which pretend to explain this phenomenon is the theory of hidden indexicals. In this paper this theory given in version of Stephen Schiffer and in version of Mark Crimmins and John Perry is considered. Schiffer argues that belief is to be analyzed as a three place relation between an agent, a proposition and some mental entity which he calls mode of presentation. From his point of view, truth condition for belief ascription includes a designation of type of mode of presentation such that this type can be supposed on the basis of context. But one may reasonable doubt that, when a reporter ascribes a belief to an agent, he actually means what he would mean according this type-specifying condition. Schiffer comes to the following conclusion: to assume that the reporter mean one certain type of mode of presentation we should have sufficient reasons to deny that he mean any other type of mode of presentation which can be supposed on the context basis. But in general we do not have such reasons. The version of Mark Crimmins and John Perry avoid this problem fragmentary. A parallel to Schiffer's mode of presentation they call a notion. According to their theory, a reporter usually is able to refer to some notion directly, without the mediation on its type. To do this he only need to know that the agent has this notion. The reason for such knowledge may consist in simple fact that once the agent was in situation disposing to form the notion of an object and he was interested in this object. One weakness of such notion specification is as follows: any changes in agent's notions must affect to the truth value of the belief ascriptions involving direct reference to these notions. Sometimes it seems to be implausible. Besides, in some contexts, as one may reasonably assume, belief ascription is true exactly because of the fact that the reporter mean not the notion itself but the notion type. To analyze such contexts Crimmins and Perry give their own formulation of type-specifying condition, and for this condition the problem raised by Schiffer occurred to be actual too.

DE the fourth kingdom; projective semiosis; technical consciousness;
   Friedrich Dessauer; pragmatics
AB The article discusses the possibility for expressing "the fourth kingdom" of Friedrich Dessauer in the philosophy of technology by means of semiotics. Technology is understood as a material realization of the projective semiosis. The essence of technology is determined by F. Dessauer in terms of Platonism: "Technology is the real idea existence finalistically formed and processed with the inventory given by the nature". Technical is an area in which fiction and fantasy, wrapped in the logical (or at least the grammatical) form, are embodied in the virtual world corresponding to the laws of nature. Technology is a projective semiosis in the part that concerns the objective realization of rational structures in the substrate of sensory perception. "The fourth kingdom" has the same function in the projective semiosis as the "world of ideas" by Plato in the receptive one. The dispute concerns the identification of the rule type applied by F. Dessauer while interpreting this world and whether it is possible today, after more than 80 years since the first publication of this conception, to take it in the author's form. The thesis of the article is that the discovery of the objective laws of technical formation as an independent "kingdom" or "world" should imply its division into groups of semantic, syntactic and pragmatic rules of projective semiosis and be considered in the context of philosophical problem of expression. "Platonism" in the philosophy of technology means the accounting of "the preset forms of decisions", making ontological premise that something non-existent cannot be invented. It requires the analysis of the inventor's access mechanisms to the preset forms in acts of speculation, implementation and processing, as well as the analysis of interaction mechanisms among "worlds", "kingdoms" or "layers of semiosis" in creative activities. In general, the philosophy of technology unfolds as a study of the rules of projective semiosis, grounded in the history of creativity philosophy and building its models contradictory to receptive semiosis. Analytical philosophy of technology, therefore, is the field where practical application of traditional speculative models of receptive semiosis analysis and creative activities can be found.

DE money; language; communication; semantics; pragmatics
AB The article is devoted to consideration of analogy of money and language, its foundation on the one hand and its productivity on the other hand. This analogy represents interest both for economical theory and for the philosophy of the language. And the problem of its prosperity is connected to that tradition in analytical philosophy which concerns the issues of social epistemology. In this work the approach itself is presented, in accordance with which it is possible to draw a conceptual parallel between money and language. The arguments in favor of the stated analogy are given. They are:
   how language denotes objects and relations between them so money conveys the price of goods and provides their exchange;
   a total combination of language units is not a constant given so the combination of token money;
   the existence of language and money is impossible to imagine without an interpreter's figure; -the interpretation of language and currency units gives the opportunity to transfer them from one system to another in an adequate way;
   language and money use in the process of social communication is founded on universal language and currency units recognition and on trust to them. The arguments against analogy of money and language are studied such as: -language primacy in relation to money does not permit to regard money as a complete analogue of linguistic systems as money cannot exist without language whereas language can; -
   token money are self-referential that differs them from language units;
   it is impossible to draw an analogy between the expression of the goods value an indication an object in the word as in the first case it is the situation when variable is used and in the second one constant is used. In the solution of this contradiction, the supporters of money and language identification propose such approach according to that the significance of token money is defined by a subject in the process of practical use, i.e. pragmatically. The critique of pragmatic conception of token money is given and the alternative view at the problem of money and language correlation. The sign nature of both is established having lack of communicative contents. Money exists in language area but its concrete functionality makes it close not with language but with other semiotic systems in which value is expressed with the help of quantitative marks. Language regarding these quantitative systems is an essential condition of existence.

DE legal life; individual legal life; group legal life; public legal life;

AB Nowadays, jurists develop and propose new categories which reflect the evolutional process in the sphere of legal science. Being one of such categories, legal life was mentioned in the works of prerevolutionary Russian scientists and is fully considered at a modern stage of development.
   The article deals with the separate elements of legal life and their analysis that enables us to form a comprehensive perception of the given legal category and characterize it as a separate legal phenomenon.
   The author separates the exchange of duties between the participants of relations as a universal criterion which enables us to differentiate legal, economic, social and political life. Moreover, the author gives a detailed analysis of a separate element of such an exchange - the object of the exchange of duties between legal life subjects. The element deals with such manifestations of legal life as individual, group, public and international forms.
   A detailed consideration of the constituent elements of legal life has not only a theoretical significance but promotes a more sensible, effective, competent and purposeful activity when realizing the right in all its forms. This fact is supported by the provision that citizens, legal entities and officials in state bodies are the subjects involved in legal life and they develop a pattern for the creation of law, its realization and application in modern Russian society.

DE power; law; justice; social theory; political philosophy
AB The article presents the contemporary socio-philosophical edition of "justice" as the reception of Aristotelian ideas of the purposeful and equal distribution. Ways of a tematization of the "justice" in the social theory and political philosophy are analyzed. Identified three ways in consideration of a justice in the social theory and political philosophy: justice as growth of a welfare, justice as the value of freedom and autonomy and justice as "virtue" and the idea of "the good life". The methodological bases of the analysis and representation of this phenomenon are noted as continuations of logic of ancient topics of "justice". The base for the modern social and philosophical theory is the idea of Aristotle on justice as the ultimate goal of the state and social in general. The political appears as the natural horizon of any self-expression and the most important aspect of a fair situation. The contemporary philosophical discussion on problems of the right shows not eliminability of the horizons "justice" from the scope of the theoretical. According to the authors, the discourse of justice serves as an area of categorization of duties and obligations, and the sphere of right applications.

DE ontology; substance; attributes; modes; natura naturata; res; the idea
   of God; God; thinking; intelligence; motion; rest
AB Spinoza understands the modes of movement /rest, and the intellect (mind) as one and the same mode of being considered under different attributes. We suggest to understand these modes as the tool by which god continuously generates the world. By means of movement and the rest there is a formation and change of things, and by means of reason there is a formation and change of ideas. The intellect is the first infinite mode of thinking. Spinoza speaks about one more infinite mode (res), about idea of god. This idea is that god "represents" about himself. It follows from attribute of thinking, and out of it through the intellect follows all ideas. If intelligence is only the tool for generation of ideas (and motion and rest is the tool for generation of things), that the idea of god represents their unity, or a substratum. Such idea is the first idea of attribute of thinking. It initially contains in an objective form only attributes, without modes. Idea of god and intellect of god are two different res with similar quality: the idea of god follows from attribute of thinking before the intellect and, therefore, initially in itself doesn't contain ideas. The infinite intellect generated by substance is the tool for formation of ideas and so doesn't comprise ideas. They are only formed by means of it in attribute of thinking. Therefore it is impossible to tell that god or substance "thinks" of something like the person. When Spinoza says that "god thinks infinitely of a lot of things", he means that it is existence and transformation of infinitely many modes (ideas) in attribute of thinking. At the same time, we understand "thinking" of substance not only as formation and change of ideas in attribute of thinking, but also as the continuous approval by substance of existence something in her (i.e. in the attribute of extension). "Thinking" of god can't "perceive" things as objects for cognition (as something external), because attributes of thinking and extension is a one whole. Therefore substance (god, nature) can't be the knowing subject. Material objects of ideas (i.e. things) about which Spinoza writes, exist only for the person. Thus, we define "cognition" or "thinking" of substance as subjectless formation, transformation and change of the "ideas" in attribute of thinking, which approve all variety of the infinite states, occurring both in attribute of thinking, and in other attributes.

So the contemporary analytical philosophy continues the project that has been started a few hundred years ago. However in the past several decades there has been progress made in this area. Philosophers like R. Kane, J. Fischer, H. Frankfurt, D. Dennett and D. Pereboom made significant contributions to clarify the issues and drafts the possible solutions. In this paper I provide a review of D. Perebooms recent book on free will - Free will, agency and the meaning of life (2014). The first part of the book is devoted to the proof of the Incompatibilism between causal determinism (and indeterminism) and responsibility. Pereboom rejects the necessity of the alternative possibilities as a necessary component for the free will and moral responsibility. However he insists on incompatibilism on other grounds. The main argument for Incompatibilism is Pereboom's original Four Case Manipulation Argument. According to the author the argument shows that there is no relevant difference between the cases when the agent is being manipulated and the cases where the behavior of the agent is being determined by the events in the past and the laws of nature. The second part of the book is Pereboom's defense of optimistic skepticism. The author argues that even without moral responsibility in the basic desert sense, the human life doesn't lose meaning and the interpersonal relations don't lose its value. In this paper I disagree with the main argument of D. Pereboom. I suggest his description of the four cases is missing important details. Most readers make a judgment about the absence of responsibility in the described cases not because there is manipulation but because there it is unclear if the agent there indeed is a person and what kind of person he is. If we fill in the important details and describe the agent in such a way that his character is being revealed the audience will likely to judge him to be morally responsible for his behavior. I try to prove my point by describing an alternative scenario to the first case of Pereboom's argument.

AB This study considers the process of media convergence and the crucial characteristics of this phenomenon. The author studies different foreign approaches to conduct an extensive analysis of this topic in more detail. The research is concerned with specific and significant differences in approaches in connection with the understanding of media convergence. In particular this phenomenon includes the two levels - technological and social ones. The technological level bounds with merging different technologies and platforms. The social level connects determined communication effects. Due to the plural character of media convergence, it is necessary to investigate the question of the effect of this phenomenon on the realm of politics. The objective of the research was to find out the aspects of interaction between media convergence and a process of political communication in the context of social and technological dimensions. In order to achieve this aim the author studies historical context - the two periods in respect of virtualization of politics. The first stage had specific features: political structures began to penetrate on the Internet by dint of creating official web-sites. This stage included the manifestation the technological level because it is a case of digitalization of political information. In the following step the sphere of politics began to comprise different communication strategies, because media convergence achieved next level of the development - social level. The object and verifiable results were obtained by the comparative-historical method. The study showed a few real-world examples which reflect the main aspects of interaction between media convergence and the process of political communication. The author argues that the new forms of political communication were created by the social context instead of the technological context. The article considers the main problems of the adaptation of the state to the modern conditions. Besides, there are social problems which prevent the transfer of the public services into electronic format. The author analyses the category of problems: the imperfection of the legal framework, the dilemma of an organizational resistance and the problem of the "digital divide"

DT Article
DE K.K. Belkin; N.A. Morozov; students; Tomsk university; letters
AB In the article the everyday life of Siberian students on the eve of the 1917 Russian Revolution is reconstructed on the basis of the letters of a student of the Faculty of Medicine of Imperial Tomsk University, K.K. Belkin, to the future honorary Academician of the Russian Academy of Science, a member of the NarodnayaVolya [People's Freedom], N.A. Morozov, which are kept in the archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences, of the personal files of the student and of periodical press materials. They provide information about student life, activities of public student and scientific organizations of Tomsk. It is noted that N.A. Morozov's visit to Tomsk in October 1915, during which he became acquainted with K.K. Belkin, was a significant event in the cultural life of the university city. According to the letters, there were other events in the life of the student after the departure of N.A. Morozov from Tomsk. Letters describe K.K. Belkin's participation in the All-Russian agricultural census in Altai and in Semipalatinsk Oblast, and mark the position of the local indigenous population. The details of the Tomsk University life are also reflected in the letters, namely, the political sympathies of the new university administration. K.K. Belkin together with professor N.I. Bereznegovsky interceded for establishing a publishing house at the university. Participating in meetings of the Tomsk Society for the Study of Siberia and the Society of Practitioners, K.K. Belkin interceded for numerous public student organizations that existed in Tomsk. However, the university administration, in his opinion, did not favor the idea to set up a student cooperative. In the article the fate of K.K. Belkin is traced, too. In 1917, he joined the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and began to take an active part in the life of the party. During the Civil War he served in the army of Kolchak. After the restoration of the Soviet power in Tomsk at the end of 1919, K.K. Belkin was arrested twice for participating in anti-Soviet activities. Since 1923, he had been serving a sentence in various camps, including the Solovki prison camp, where he helped patients because he had studied at the Faculty of Medicine. In 1938, K.K. Belkin was arrested and executed on charges with counter-revolutionary activity and espionage. And only in 1992 he was rehabilitated. The article emphasizes that K.K. Belkin's letters expand our understanding of the pre-revolutionary life of Siberian students.

ID ATTENDANCE
AB According to the fact that modern societies evolve in postindustrial or informational stages, cultural capital became one of the most important resources of innovation processes in the local regions. This article describes the results of research, which completed as a part of the initiated by the Russian Institute of Philosophy in 2005 main research project "Sociocultural evolution of Russia and its regions". Methodology of this project assumes that we can use cultural activity the frequency of cultural places attendance as a criterion for measurement of a cultural capital in a region.
   Sociological researches of the cultural activity mostly involve two theories in the process of finding determining factors: P. Bourdieu cultural capital concept and the rational choice theory, so we shortly described these approaches in the first part of the article. In the second part we analyzed the influence of different factors on the cultural activity of the Tomsk region settlers. We exploited results of the 2015 year research which was completed with help by Russian Governmental Scientific Fund.
   We found that we could divide Tomsk population into three main groups:
   -the group with a high level of cultural activity, which consists mainly from young people (less than 29 years age) and people of intermediate and higher social statuses.
   -the group with a mediate level of cultural activity married with children respondents, who begun to visit cultural places (and especially nightclubs, stadiums and cinemas) much more rarely.
   -the group of culturally inactive respondents, mostly elder than 60 years or/and people with social status lower than intermediate.
   Researching determinative for cultural activity factors, we found two interesting points: absence of influence of education factor on the attendance of cultural places (including museum and theatre) and absence of clear influence of a social status on women's cultural activity combined with clear influence of social statuses on men's cultural activity.
   We concluded that cultural activity of people in Tomsk was rather high according to other Russian regions, and this fact implicitly approved our presumption that there was link between region's innovation stage and its level of cultural activity. Further, our research data reveal high cultural activity is typical mostly for young people. We can assume that there is still no formed cultural elite (or it doesn't demonstrate cultural activity which we could find with our questionnaire) which could be stable source of a region's innovative evolution.

AB The necessity for a more holistic consideration of the phenomenon using philosophical methodologies. Briefly describes the Genesis of the concept of organizational culture and main factors of its actualization. The phenomenon of organizational culture is considered in the framework adopted in two scientific approaches: rational-pragmatic and phenomenological.
   According to the rational-pragmatic approach, organizational culture is thought of as a tool to improve the efficiency of the organization. The distinguishing feature of this approach to install on the ability to manage culture in the aspect of creating and modifying its value in the kernel. This approach is widespread among theorists and practitioners of management.
   The phenomenological approach is understood as the essence of any social organization. The aim of this approach is the interpretation of the various manifestations of organizational culture. I.e. in the framework of the phenomenological approach to organizational culture is not a property, which has the organization and what it essentially is. In this vein, the management culture is being somenone, not to mention creating or editing its value in the kernel.
   The classical interpretation of organizational culture is the definition of foreign specialist Shane E. in his work "Organizational culture and leadership". Where the organizational culture is a set of basic concepts (basic assumptions), which operate at the subconscious level and are taken for granted the attitude of the staff yourself and the outside world for the purpose of internal integration and external adaptation. The basic concepts are cultural archetypes, they represent the core of organizational culture and are difficult to analyze by people for whom these archetypes are of a fundamental nature.
   Consideration of this problem requires a holistic view of the organizational culture as part in the system of General ideas about the culture in General. The General culture is thus considered as a special chelovekovedenija subsystem of society that reveals itself through its functional content. These functions can be subdivided into three groups.
   The first group includes the functions of the integrative nature, which also includes axiological, ideological, as well as the function of self-preservation and unification.
   The second group includes function as a process of goal-setting, maintenance and regulation of vital functions of the team.
   The third group of functions are those that provide accumulation and transmission of social experience in the organization.
   Organizational culture in structural-funkcionalna aspect is cut of the General culture or broader culture (national culture). Core bringing together a common culture and organizational culture are universal norms and values. The semantic kernel which is the basic triad: labour, morality and creativity. This triad serves as the underlying, where the work focuses on the present, as a major integration factor; the morality of acts is the focus on the past and koumouliruet in yourself to tradition, rules, regulations and practices of the activity, the usefulness of which is not questioned; creativity allows you to see the future and to realize the function of foresight or anticipation, directed to the future. This together lays the Foundation for the culture of any organized community. From this arises the need to classify organizational culture as a phenomenon to the set of problems that are conceptually very plastic in nature, largely due to the great attention from the social Sciences and Humanities, but still required a holistic and comprehensive philosophical investigation using philosophical and methodological tools that, until comparatively a very young cultural phenomenon.

DE migration; the Middle East; Europe; political process; Islam; religion;

AB Migration crisis that shook the European countries in 2015, seriously affected the development of political processes in the EU. However, to recognize the movement of large masses of people to Europe from Syria and neighboring areas, as only consequences of the "Arab Spring", acts of ISIL or search for better life, seem to be in correct. Those events were provoked by the revitalization processes in Islam and the attempts of the traditional oriental society to respond to external challenges. The author, basing his ideal on opinions of the Constructivists about the importance of identity's indicators (largely based on religion) to all social and political institutions and processes, believes that such a large-scale migration has become possible due to the overlapping of two civilizational paradigms: search by Muslims of their identity and the identity crisis in the modern European society.

AB The article analyzes the process of formation of cognitive management strategies in knowledge society. The specific character of these strategies is identified, its potential is characterized. The article touches upon the issue of meaning of management through knowledge arrays as a relevant impact resource. Transformation of knowledge status into knowledge civilization leads to a change in management strategies. It is affirmed that the role of innovations is very important in the knowledge society, introduced in enterprises, social institutions and communities of knowledge society. Bringing up an issue of strategy specifics of innovation problem investigation in the context of knowledge society concept, it is worth paying attention to socio-cultural effects of the phenomenon of innovation. The sense of this effect, which in our opinion is manifested in knowledge society, consists of the diffusion, to which innovations in knowledge civilization are exposed. Diffusion takes place within certain areas as well as it touches complex interdisciplinary interactions, which causes synergy of subject areas. Sociocultural effect is also consists of innovation ability to initiate transformations of knowledge, which cause reformations of social structures and processes. We outline the idea that the problem of inevitable knowledge obsolescence can find its effective solution through addressing to the mechanisms of innovative development. By virtue of the ability of innovation to generate in social systems the opportunity to adapt to a situation, where environment has high level of dynamics and risks complexity, in knowledge society the ideas of innovation manifest themselves in all social spheres. It is proved that evaluation of the role of innovation, proposed in the problem field of cognitive management creates preconditions for relevant assessment of knowledge as dominant factor of social development and dominant values of knowledge society, as well as gives an opportunity to evaluate adequately the status of knowledge in value increasing of individual intellectual potential. The analysis of nature, specifics and potential of cognitive management strategies is the theoretical platform on which it is possible to analyze a number of important issues related to knowledge management. This is analysis of models of knowledge creation, teaching structures creation, knowledge transfer mechanisms and mechanisms of forgetting. This is study of cultural barriers in knowledge management, the research of intellectual capital evaluation models, and finally, the analysis of knowledge role in growth dynamics and everything, associated with knowledge as the most important resource factor in knowledge society.

AB In the paper, I discuss the question of moral responsibility and dependence of the answer on the existence of collective mind. I argue that collective mind is not a necessary condition for collective moral responsibility. For thesis justification, I take responsibility conditions proposed by Christian List and Philip Pettit. Responsibility conditions are normative significance, judgmental capacity and relevant control. It is shown that not only individuals, but groups as well may satisfy such conditions. The presence of collective mind does not make any difference in satisfying all three conditions together or each one separately. Therefore, the possibility of collective responsibility for groups does not depend on the presence of collective mind.

AB This review discusses the collective monograph "Becoming a Professor: Academic Careers, Markets and Power in Five Countries" published by New Literary Observer in Moscow. The authors of this voluminous book pursued two goals at the same time. First, they sought to prepare a guidebook on academic careers in France, the USA, Germany, Great Britain, and Russia for young sociologists who are thinking ahead about their professional pathway. Based on various data sources (interviews, secondary data, autoethnography), they present an institutional history of the formation of academic sociology as a profession and describe the main trajectories in the academic biography of sociologists in five countries. Second, they find differences in institutional and extra-institutional mechanisms of recruitment for sociologists and offer a theoretical explanation. They offer the category of "optical systems" as a cultural framework of university organization used by various external and internal agents with different types of resources and motivation. "Optical systems" become an important source of coping with distrust and the fear of being cheated by "noble swindlers, " since the dynamics of the academic world are forced by the replacement of the suspicions vocabulary. In this review, we give a brief analysis of the chapters, presenting the advantages and weaknesses. This book discusses several important issues: morals and markets in academia; the impact and work of economic incentives; and the strengths and weaknesses of social networks, academic pathways, and political culture. Because of its provocative statements, incriminating comments, and polemic conclusions, this book is worth reading for all those who are involved in the modern system of higher education and science-academics, civil servants, governors, and of course, various experts.

The globalization of environmental problematics, its decisions with catastrophic scale often not beyond to scope for one country. It is essential that global efforts concentrate on the economic, political, legal, ideological direction.
   Thinkers were interested in the interrelationship of Man and Nature for a long time. They have received the philosophical understanding in the works of V.I. Vernadsky, Le Roy and Teilhard de Chardin. The proposed concepts were based on different positions. The theory of V.I. Vernadsky is based on the scientific material, Le Roy and Teilhard de Chardin took religious and idealistic postulates as a bases.
   By its orientation, the position of V.I. Vernadsky is optimistic, he believes in the future of Man; the concept of Teilhard de Chardin is based on the eschatological conclusions. Characteristics of the main statement of the noosphere, the place of science, scientific progress in the study of the system "Nature-Man", considered by V.I. Vernadsky, in its essence echo the conclusions of many scientists materialists.
   The fundamental nature of the noosphere teaching of V.I. Vernadsky is confirmed by its present relevance.

AB The objective of this research is a historical reconstruction of the training stages of physical chemistry specialists at a higher school on the example of the activities of Novosibirsk State University (NSU) in the second half of the 20th century under the influence of various factors: from intrinsic and general scientific prerequisites to the changing social and economic conditions. The subject of analysis is the educational activities of the chemical departments of NSU aimed at the training of specialists in the field of physical chemistry and related areas, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The role of Soviet academic institutions and their scientific leaders in the institutionalization of physical chemistry and chemical physics fundamental for the new field of physical and chemical knowledge of magnetic phenomena is analyzed. In the Novosibirsk Scientific Center, research has always been based on the principles of "integration and interdisciplinarity" and relied on the skilled personnel. NSU was the key actor in the replenishment of the scientific staff. The system of the training of qualified chemists in NSU was determined by several factors: advances of national and international chemical science, development of chemical and related industries, the policy of the development of raw material regions including Siberia, socio-economic and political processes in the society including the evolution of science and the education policy. Two departments of NSU, the Physical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Natural Sciences, and the Chemical and Biological Physics Department, Faculty of Physics, were engaged in educating professionals in the new direction of spin chemistry -magnetic resonance spectroscopy and later MRI. The Institute of Chemical Kinetics and Combustion of SB USSR AS / SB RAS and the International Tomography Center played a major role in staffing these departments. Carefully designed curricula for graduates in physical chemistry adjusted to the "Phystech" principles cultivated their ability to respond to emerging issues creatively and professionally, and opened opportunities for the development of promising scientific fields, including magnetic resonance and its practical applications. Mobility and adaptability of curricula of these two departments provided for the interdisciplinary competence of their graduates. Inter-departmental cooperation embraced several directions: joint research projects, organization of diploma and work experience for students of physics and natural sciences, teaching jobs for leading scientists of the academic institutes, scientific support of graduates, in-house conferences and seminars, participation in national student conferences, etc. All these factors contributed to the success in the institutionalizing of the new direction of physical chemistry - spin chemistry and its applications, including MRI.

TI THE THEORY OF NATIONALISM AND HISTORICAL RESEARCH: UNIVERSALISM VS.
   PARTICULARISM
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE nationalism; nation; civilization theory; modernization theory;
   perennialism; factor approach to historical processes
AB The article proves that the historicity of the phenomenon of nationalism makes its theory only possible "in the field of history and under its auspices" using the principles of historicism and methodological synthesis. Such a "synthetic" theory for the study of nationalism should be established in the active interaction of the Humanities and Social Sciences. A look at nationalism on the basis of common historical meta-theories allows us to take the phenomenon in a broader historical context, to take into account factors that determine the specific development of peculiar nationalisms, to find in nationalism the particular and the universal features which are inherent in its nature. A special role for nationalism study belongs to the modernization theory and the civilization theory reflecting the particular and the universal principle in the development of humankind. From a formal point of view the study logic of these theories is identical. Both theories are equally focused on the study of historical transformations. The only difference is that the civilization theory investigates the processes of transformation within culture, while for the modernization theory the priority areas of analysis are the transformation processes in political and economic institutions. The ability to balance between the universalistic vector of modernization and the particularistic vector of the civilizational identity opens up broad prospects for the use of the multidisciplinary factor approach, because only the latter provides a relevant combination of elements of civilization and modernization theories for explanations of the rapid transformation of archaic peoples in the modern nation with all their attributes like national identity and institutions of national and local government. To justify this theoretical scheme the authors of the article provide an empirical example associated with the modernization of state policy in the 1920s for the Buryats by the Communists that were in power. On this basis, it is concluded that the Soviet modernization of state policy towards the peoples of Russia was carried out taking into account Russian civilizational peculiarities that included elements of both western and eastern culture types. The modernization of interethnic relations was westernized. It was solving problems of attracting intellectuals in non-Russian peoples to control their own peoples and inclusion of the non-Russian bulk of the population in the political life, in raising of the culture level and quality of life for these peoples. However, the very political system of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union contributed to the preservation of ethnic identity of the Eastern peoples and features of the eastern type of culture within the Russian civilization. At the same time among the peoples belonging to the eastern type of culture there was a strong kinship principle which was integrated into the new government system.

   ART HISTORY

DT Article
DE miracle-play; medieval theatre genre; historical culturology; new
   historicism; philosophical typology of cultures
AB The essay focuses on the problem of an adequate estimation of the medieval miracle-play genre.
   The causes of the existing aberrations may be found in the methodological approaches, that do not comply with the very nature of the medieval phenomenon. The legitimacy of criteria typical for the Antique or Renaissance tragedy, applied in aesthetical treatises by the XVI century humanists and existing up until today, is given consideration. It is asserted that the attempts to estimate miracle-plays according to genre criteria formed in other cultures, can not be productive.
   Taken as an example, the analyses of Rutebeuf's Le Miracle De Theophile illustrates the efficiency of new methodological principals, which allow to discover the genre as a substantial form, inwardly connected with the existential horizons of culture.
   The analysis utilizes an interdisciplinary approach: a combination of theatre science (revealing drama architectonics - the conflict, which displays itself trough the sequence of perepeteia of dramatic action) with philosophy of culture, based on conceptions of regional ontology. Philosophical and typological reconstructions of the historical worldview horizon of culture reveal parameters of uniqueness and integrity of medieval culture. Analysis of Rutebeuf's Miracle proves that it possesses a true dramatic conflict, typical for medieval theocentrical view of the world. The reference to biographical facts of Rutebeuf's life, reveals vital roots of the miracle-play. A collision evolving into a conflict (Theophile, the main character of the book, who was angered by his master's injustice, rises against him and strikes a deal with the Satan). However, the obtained spiritual and political power, together with wealth and freedom provoke an internal conflict, that deprives his soul of peace and calm. A dramatic energy emerges in the soul suffering a discord and provides action with new impulses. The character is moved by this conflict through the labyrinth of an earthly hell. But after revolting against his master and losing connection with him, Theophile is not able to forget him. Memory is unfolding as a force, which connects two states of his mind: the clarity lost in the past and the hope for a possible return. But the miracle can't occur on its own. The depth of the memory can be enlightened only through a hard work, i.e. prayer as a sublime form of labor. At a turning point, when a miracle takes place, the character embraces peace once again. By learning Rutebeuf's biography, we can discover the real roots of this miracle-play: the "white" and "black" professors were involved in a bitter dispute over labor in this period. The article argues that solution of the dramatic conflict via a miracle is not artificial (deus ex machina), but is naturally intertwined into consciousness horizons of medieval culture.
   The essay puts forward a question about the place of miracle-play in the system of genres. It is argued, that the miracle and the genres of mystery-play, not morality play, represent most perfect forms of medieval theater and require detailed analyses

DE new cold war; nuclear weapons; structures of rivalry; geopolitics;

AB The article is dedicated to the contemporary analytical discourse on a "new cold war". The critical attitude towards this concept is based on the analysis of Cold War history, its roots, content and evolution. The phenomenon of Cold War and the post-bipolar history are placed in the context of transition periods (periods of grand destabilization), which characterize transition from one model of international relations to the other. The author looks into variants of new structures of rivalry between Russia and the West ranging from rigid confrontation to soft forms of competition. Among key factors, influencing these processes, the role of nuclear weapons is pointed out. The thesis that constructive polycentrism as interaction between competition and partnership is the most favourable strategy for international security and development is substantiated. Special attention is paid to problems of political subjectivity of the European Union and to arguments for its strategic partnership with Russia.

DT Article
DE state-owned enterprises (SOEs); public ownership; public services;
   performance; concurrence; competitiveness; SOEs governance;
   public-private partnership (PPP); OECD
AB The article analyzes the evolution of the state-owned enterprises' (SOEs) role in the economy in the period from 1998 to 2013. The attention to this subject is determined by the growing influence of SOEs at the national and international levels, in particular by the internationalization of their activities in both developed and developing (emerging) economies. Within the category of enterprises that are recognized as state-owned, two groups are distinguished in accordance to the share of state's participation in the equity (types A and B). Type A includes majority-owned enterprises where the state owns more than 50 per cent of the shares or holds effective control by other means. Type B includes minority-owned enterprises in which the state holds between 10 and 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital or voting rights (partly state-owned enterprises, PSOEs). The international investment activities of SOEs dramatically increased after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. This is a relatively new phenomenon which is likely to develop further in the near future. The key models and spheres of SOEs dissemination are presented (petroleum and infrastructure, financial services, utilities). The performance of SOEs and private enterprises is compared in several sectors (oil exploration, extracting industries, supply of electricity and heating, communication, aviation). The author analyzes the OECD-led efforts to reform the guidelines of the governance and accountability of SOEs with the aim to increase efficiency and transparency of SOEs functioning in accordance with high international standards of responsible business conduct. An overview of the main changes to the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises (2005) is presented. The document stresses that SOEs should not be used to finance political activities; that the governments should be able to identify and disclose the public policy rationales that justify the maintenance of enterprises under state ownership. At last, the OECD indexes that characterize the state's role in the economy (direct government control over enterprises and governance of SOEs) are analyzed. The author expects an increase of the SOEs role in the national and global economy in the short and long term for managing the challenges of the currently very turbulent economic environment.

   CENTRAL ASIAN COUNTRIES IN THE BEGINNING OF THE 18TH CENTURY
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian Empire; Central Asia; Khanates; Khiva; Peter the Great
AB In the early 18th century the Russian Empire was a powerful state experiencing a cultural and scientific boom and possessing a developed industry, structured and centralized administration, high-qualified armed forces, including the navy, and secular education. That state differed dramatically from the 17th-century Russia that fell behind time in economy, warfare and culture. In the 18th century, Russian diplomacy started to move in a new direction, of critical importance for Russia, towards relations with Asian states. For the whole century Russia was opposed by Central Asian Khanates, mainly by the Khiva Khanate. In this area, it was the expansion to India that had been put forward by Peter the Great as the main objective. The Russian emperor viewed the British colony as a land of immense riches. But the Khanates laid down as a buffer zone between the emperor's ambitions and the area that actually represented the sphere of influence of the British Empire. However, any kind of expansion to India was impossible without the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Khanates. Having realized that, Peter the Great set a course for active penetration into the region by means of expeditions and diplomatic missions, which opened the era of Central Asian studies in Russia and provided a demand for a thorough analysis of bilateral trade and economic cooperation perspectives. For Russia-Khanates 18th-century relations studies, the introduction of new primary sources into scientific use is both a necessity and a great chance for a researcher. Although a great number of the 18th-century documents have already been revealed and for contemporary historical studies it is definitely not a complete singularity, plenty of sources related to Russia-Central Asia ties are still unexposed. One could view this as a considerable omission, as it was the 18th century, when the relations actually started to evolve. The course of Russia-Khiva relations in the beginning of the 18th century stimulated many Russian scholars of that time to seek the most favorable means of interaction with the Khanates. A great opportunity to review these studies is provided by the analysis of a unique document discovered in the Archive of the Institute of Russian History (Russian Academy of Sciences, St Petersburg). As a result of such an analysis, it can be concluded that Russian political and military elite in the early 18th century was not only well-informed on Khiva, but developed the plans of military expansion as well.

   legislative system
AB Australian legal system which deals with modern scientific and technological base began in 1949. At that time, the Advisory Council of Science and Industry was restructured into the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). CSIRO activities are regulated by the Science and Industry Research Act 1949. The Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976 No. 85 was adopted by the liberal government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser (1975-1983). The main purposes of the law are, firstly, to encourage the development of an efficient, competitive and export-oriented production; secondly, to establish a branch structure which requires a minimum level of state support. John Button, Industry Minister of the Hawke cabinet, initiated major changes in the field of industrial policy legislation, reduction of customs tariffs and other forms of protectionism. Protectionism at that time was a major drag on the scientific and technological development of Australia. In 1986, two fundamental laws for industrial research and development in Australia were passed. Firstly, it was the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Research and Development) Act 1986. Secondly, it was the Industry Research and Development Act 1986. This act is the main one in the R&D field today. The purpose of the act is the help of the government to improve the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australian industry, the promotion of research and development as well as innovation. The order of activities related to venture capital investment has been established. The 1990s-2000s is the second stage of development of the legislative framework in the field of R&D. This is a time of political change of Prime Ministers Paul Keating (1991-1996) and John Howard (1996-2007). The scientific and technological development of this period is characterized by legislative measures in the area of commercialization of scientific developments. The main legislative acts of this period include the Patents Act 1990 No. 83, the Trade Marks Act 1995 No. 119, the Designs Act 2003 No. 147. R&D in Australia is mainly concentrated in traditional industries and production, but not in the high technology industry and high technologies. Economy focuses on the sale of resources and agricultural products. Business does not seek to achieve success in the innovative development. These are the main issues that concern the Government of Australia over the past decades.

AB The aim of the study is the analysis of the leading organ of the Tobolsk Diocese - Tobolsk Diocesan Gazette (Tobol'skie eparkhial'nye vedomosti). The content of published materials on the legislative policy of the government in the field of management, public life, education and other spheres of life in the late 19th - early 20th centuries. Emphasis is placed on the everyday moments of life that constituted the essence of the existence of urban and rural population. In the scientific literature this problem is not widespread, many questions concerning the interaction of the Russian Orthodox Church and the state authorities in the areas of legislation, including the publication of normative legal acts on the pages of the authorities of the Orthodox clergy have not been studied. The analysis of the topics is based on materials of a separate regional (diocesan) edition, which makes it undoubtedly relevant. This perspective allows to identify features typical for other media as well as specific characteristics of an edition of a distant region of Russia. The study is based on the principles of historical knowledge: historicism, comprehensiveness, objectivity and scientific validity. The systematic approach in this study is used when examining the structure of publishing legal materials in the edition as a single network in the framework of the studied subject. The complexity of the studied object, which does not allow to conduct the study only within historical science, determines the use of the interdisciplinary approach, developments in sociology, political science, demography, cultural studies and other disciplines. The local approach is used to identify the print edition in the imperial space, to determine its characteristics and specify it in all regional mass media. The structural-functional approach allows to identify the object of study as a separate phenomenon with its specific characteristics. The problem-chronological approach reflects the change in the components of the object in the historical dynamics under the influence of changing environmental conditions. The method of periodization (diachronic) is used to detect object changes in time in establishing the conditions and moments of its transformation. Processing the quantitative data also required the use of statistical methods. During the study of the topic it is planned to identify the related regulations and materials published in the newspaper to reveal the attitude of the clergy of Tobolsk Province to autocracy, to see legal measures and to track changes in the legislation in the period of the transformation of society and a major overhaul of patriarchal foundations.

AB In this article, we turn to the consideration of the phenomenon of fear in the mode of authorization. Fear is understood by us as one of the possible states of the human being, belonging to a time modality. Fear has a significant impact on the actions, emotions, thinking. The last point is particularly important because the ability to think for us is a defining feature of the semantic content of human life. The idea of the study due to the urgent need to pay attention to what is usually omitted as "self-evident", reinforcing the illusion of clarity and omission in relation to their perceptions of the subject. Fear is in the mode of authorization leads to discredit the ability to avoid utrasheniya and becomes a way of entering into a state of intimidation. Genuine fear arises when the very existence of man becomes a problem. In this sense, fear acts as one of the definitions of man as a "horrifying creatures." Placing the phenomenon of fear in the scope of the actual philosophy leads to fear, which is one of the fundamental categories of philosophical knowledge, it is a special form of describing things.

DE emergentism; functional properties; elementary structures; mental
   causation
AB In this paper, we shall cover the theoretical and methodological fundamentals of emergentism in contemporary philosophy of mind and linguistics. The main purpose is to pinpoint the benefits of emergent models in the context of non-reductive functionalism, the theory of syntactic complexity and conceptual semantics. In our view, the dynamic model of the structuring process of elementary components allows associate the mind-body problem of consciousness with the problem of syntactic complexity and properties of non-strict semantics. The emergent structuring is dynamic, flexible, variable, and prone to compromise on the rules that have shaped the structural elements. In our view, this key feature of consciousness (multiple vague interpretation) is reflected in the semantics and pragmatics of the language sign. We proceed from the statement that the "challenging problem" of consciousness, the result of a specific ontology of the language sign. The semantic and pragmatic nature of a linguistic sign may be considered a link between mental states, phenomenal judgments (self-assessment), and mental causation. The article substantiates the idea that the emergent approach may help avoiding the linear downward causation and reductive physicalism, while the qualitative emergentism may be represented in terms of conceptual semantic processes. The emergent properties of language and consciousness result from the constraints imposed by different ontological areas: brain structure, principles of organization of cognitive activity, social relations, varieties of interactional contexts, etc. The emergence approach explains both substrate and functional properties of the relation between the brain and consciousness. Language semantics exists because the brain processes "do not happen in the dark." The phenomena of the qualitative experience are organized in a specific way: there is a whole hierarchy of phenomenal judgment supporting the relation between semantics and ontology. Yet, it does not matter whether it is about the tangible or imaginary world. Apparently, the "gap" between the mental component and the physical causes of these contents is filled with a certain meta-level where the interdependent relationship between the "external" and "internal" consciousness, speech and language, denotation and connotation are implemented. It is at this level that the restrictions of the numerous ontological areas are imposed.

DE intentional identity; intentional objects; skepticism; holism; "On
   Non-Being"
AB The article argues against the "Reasoned Indifference" strategy (as Walter Edelberg calls it), which is proposed by some semanicists to address the problem of intentional identity. Our argument complements Edelberg's one. Namely, we have offered an interpretation of the third argument from Gorgias's of Leontinoi treatise "On Non-Being", according to which the objects of each intentional act are isolated in the world, created by the agent, or even by the unique agent's act. This bring about not only intransitivity of thought of one agent / intentional act to another agent / intentional act, for example, by means of some signs - letters, speeches, gestures..,. but also this entails that it is absolute impossible for two agent / two intentional acts to deal with the one and same object, even if such transmission is not implicated. Thereby it is impossible: to increase the knowledge about the same intentional object (or add characteristics to it by deduction or any other procedure); to be aware of one's own cognitive acts (to introspect); to correlate the perceived object with the thought one; to connect the different perceptions to one and the same (thought, imagined...) object. All this is a serious challenge to epistemology. Undoubted depth of these problems shows that any attempts to ignore the well-justified impossibility of intentional identity simply as an amusing argument, that has nothing to do with either ancient or modern philosophical discussions, as proponents of the strategy of "Reasonable Indifference" propose, cannot be successful. The difficulties faced by modern semanicists - when they are trying to understand the conditions under which intentional objects are identical - are not accidental ones. On the contrary, those difficulties have a long and venerable history, being closely connected with skeptical, relativistic and holistic arguments.

AB Salmon and Schiffer have proposed theories of belief ascriptions accommodating well known puzzling phenomena such as a rational agent's harboring conflicting attitudes toward a proposition. I compare their accounts of this phenomenon and argue that Salmon's account is preferable because of two reasons: 1) it is more parsimonious, for it does not include types of modes of presentation into semantic analysis of belief reports; 2) it presupposes more plausible division of labor between the semantic and the pragmatic analysis of belief reports.

DE sign; meaning; actor; information
AB Meaning - is the object, which is marked by another object - sign. Any object represents complete information about himself, including its current characteristics and states. On the other hand, the object is regarded as a reflection inside of the actor (in memory of the actor), where the meaning is associated with its sign by instructive rule. The actor divides the space as internal and external in reference to himself, and accordingly the sign and the meaning can be belong to the internal and the external actor's space. Accordingly, signs and meanings of the external and the internal space of the actor have their own characteristics. The actor may be presented as a multilayer structure including the layers from the physical to consciousness, each of which has its own memory. Identical meanings of the actor's internal space have interlevel relations and constitute a shared memory fragments. From the part of the actor the information can be understood as the current state and change (for internal or external reasons) the physical and mental state of the actor. The actor in the physical layer is exposed to a large number of physical effects, that is external space information, and only some part of the physical information goes to the consciousness, forming the meaning of the internal space. The object in the external space of the actor is understood as complete information about himself or the whole meaning. In the internal space of the actor the information about the object on the physical level of the actor is shown after physical interaction. Thus it is clear that information about the physical object is not complete, but only partial. Sign of external space is full information about themselves and the transition into the internal space of the actor there is complete and unambiguous information about himself. Using the notion of "information" gives an opportunity of structuring notions of "sign" and "meaning" against the actor, and creates a new level of understanding of their interrelationship.

DE Wittgenstein; Eastern philosophy; silence; comparative analysis
AB The problem of mutual relations between language and world has always been of interest both western and eastern philosophy. In particular, the special attention is still paid to silence which is represented as a specific category of language. It is possible to find plenty of ideas concerning understanding of the phenomenon of silence in the world wide philosophy. However, in our opinion the idea of comparing the visions of two philosophical systems belonging to different cultural traditions and ways of thinking is the most effective. The article presents a comparative analysis of the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein and eastern philosophical systems that represented by Taoism and Buddhism, in their attitude to the phenomenon of silence. The author of the article examines the problem in three main aspects: 1. understanding of philosophy as an activity and defining the role of language in it; 2. setting apart of showing as a third mode of communication from speaking and silence; 3. The designation of the specifics of understanding of silence in the context of wittgensteinian and eastern philosophical thought. This research aims to identify similarities and differences in the understanding of the category of silence in two considered philosophical systems. The necessity for such clarification of the results of the hard work of his thought is conditioned by the fact that Wittgenstein's philosophy has had and still continues to exert so strong influence not only on modern Western but also on Eastern philosophy. Silence plays an important role for both Wittgenstein's philosophy and Eastern philosophy. These two ways to practice of silence are not identical in point of fact, but they complement each other. In that way, the philosophy of Wittgenstein not only shows a clear resemblance to the thought of oriental philosophical practices, but it can also be understood as contributing to their understanding. As well as the other way around: understanding of Taoism and Buddhism can be of great help in achieving a better understanding of the philosophy of Wittgenstein.

DE God; ontology; methodology; multilevel semantics
AB The article "God as a Theoretical Object, or About Ontological Status of God Again" consists of introduction, four general parts, and conclusion. In introduction author tells about her motivation. Then a situation in the middle of XXth century is described. A new strong interest to God's existence arising in 60s was based on the possible world semantics developed by Saul Kripke. Approaches developed by Norman Malcolm, Charles Hartshorne, and Alvin Plantinga are considered since they were extremely important for subsequent investigations. In the second part the general idea of multilevel possible world semantics is presented, where each level contains the only one sort of essences. The essences of the level can exist in weak of strong senses. Every level has to be arranged to others levels by principle of Coherence Dictum. The essences of different levels exist in different ways. The one level is special - its essences exist "really", in a genuine way. These are the states of affairs. God is not a state of affairs and not the object like a tree, a hill, or a human. God is described as a very specially object, kind of a property of "arranging the worlds", the law of construction the system of worlds itself. In the third part the author considers God as a theoretical object in methodological sense. Then author analyses the possibility of combining the methodological ideas of V.A. Smirnov with some semantic ideas of P. Tichy.

AB Kunchen Zhamyan Shadpa Dorje (1648-1722) was a prominent Tibetan politician, an outstanding teacher and a universal scholar, made a huge contribution to the development of Buddhism in Central Asia. The political weight of Zam'an Sadpy and its activities in central Tibet and Amdo are directly linked to its prestige as a scientist-philosopher-encyclopaedist and scholastic. He is the author of fundamental works on logic, history, iconography, hagiography, sacred geography and bibliography spelling, Linguistics, Lexicology, poetics, history of philosophy, philosophy, madhiamika, jogachara, Abhidharma, etc. All his works are represented in the 15-volume collection. So far, they are considered the most significant works on the history of religion and philosophy of ancient India, Tibet, China and Mongolia. Kunchen Zhamyan Shadpa lived and worked in the period of political sharing of power and influence between contenders for power in Tibet, accompanied by ideological confrontation and armed conflict. Second half of xVII century marked by large-scale rebuilding political order throughout inner Asia, from the late 17TH to early 18TH centuries in the Tibetan tradition, there was considerable internal transformation of the Gelugpas, both in the sphere of Scholasticism, and against political role and one of the most important role in this process was played by Kunchen Zhamyan Shadpa Dorje. Thanks to its creative, educational, and political activities of the position They have increased not only in Tibet but throughout Buddhist inner Asia. In modern science Kunchen Zhamyan Shadpa name is better known. Firstly, through its scientific productivity, closely involving proselytizing, has had an impact on the distribution of the philosophical Sciences in Tibet. Secondly, the largest Buddhist Centre founded by him scholarship north-eastern outskirts of Tibet has played a significant role in training and self-development of the followers of the Gelug tradition. However, despite this popularity, there is still no special study about the life and work of Kunchen Zhamyan Shadpa, collected biographical, historical, political, creative data as well as religious and philosophical views, illuminating the diversity aspects of this outstanding person. In this connection, the relevance of the information provided by the article is unquestionable, as its practical value.

Therefore, as a result of targeted research within certain limits (boundaries), definition of social tension and appears in sociology as a nominal definition, without taking into account the general philosophical perspective. Not clarifying the same philosophical aspect in the notion of "social tension", it is impossible to give an interpretation of the notion of a private event without its "inferiority: incompleteness, unilateralism, etc.

DE the language of science; creativity; epistemological status, integration
AB The background for this paper is the view that cultural-contextual concept of the language of science contains the idea of linguistic creativity. However, the idea of creativity gives the language of science epistemological status. Cultural-contextual concept includes theories imparting the status of a cultural phenomenon to the language of science. The problem of the epistemological status is related to the cultural foundations of the linguistic ontology and language practice. The wider presentation of this aspect as the linguistic variety (creativity) raises a question of the value of linguistic creativity. If the uncontrolled increase of variety brings down the inner controllability and dynamic characteristics of the system. So the creativity in the language of science is able to cause a large number of problems in the process of resolving the conflict between knowledge and ignorance. The philosophy of language has been developing as a critique of language. There are many cases of the preference for the reality direct perception to language expression throughout the history of science. The problem is any language forces the particular experience preventing it from novelty and freshness of the experience perception through interpretation, description and representation. Comparison across different research perspectives facilitates understanding and overcoming the inevitable parochialism of the particular language of sciences. The current stage of the scientific development is characterized by integration and multidisciplinarity of the research. Is the language able to be transmitted to the other branch of science without some significant changes of semantics? This question seems interesting to consider from the perspective of analytical philosophy taking into account the hypothetical problem of the language of science conceptualization.

DE religious philosophy; patristic; antique philosophy; anthropology;
   sexual distinctions; saving
AB Now many researchers consider division of the human race into men and women (sexual distinctions) and its consequences the most important initial features of social reality. Holy Fathers think differently. They consider that division of people on man's and a female (and the social distinctions connected with it) is caused by Adam and Eve's fall. This division wasn't initially, before fall, and won't be in eschatological prospect when there is no sin. Some modern writers, in particular, P. A. Sapronov, consider that similar vision by fathers of Church "sex problem" is caused by influence on them of ancient philosophy, first of all a platonizm. In article the similar point of view is disproved. Is shown that the perception of sexual division as secondary and passing has the bases in the Bible and logically follows from the basic principles of Christian divinity. Really, explaining the position, fathers of Church refer not to Platon, and to the Bible. Already the first mention of division of people on man's and a female (also create God of the person, on the God's image create it: the husband and the wife create them (Gen. 1, 27)), by close examination in the context of Christian divinity, clearly points to secondariness of sexual distinctions. Fathers of Church note that the understanding of this verse as whole with need demands recognition of division on man's and a female as the making God's image in the person. It, in turn, demands to recognize existence of sexual distinctions in God. As for fathers of Church any conversation on sexual distinctions in God is a nonsense so far as it is impossible to say also that division on man's and the female is a component of the God's image in the person. Means, this division not initially and isn't the immanent characteristic of a human nature. It is obvious that the only option of an explanation possible in this situation assumes communication of division on man's and a female with fall and its consequences. And it only one of arguments of fathers of Church who are considered in article. All their set allows to say with confidence that so-called "the sex problem" isn't for Christianity something external, introduced from ancient philosophy, but logically follows from the fundamentals of Christian dogma other than bases of an antique world view. It is the good example showing that, without denying influence of ancient philosophy on patristical thought in general, it is necessary to look attentively in each case, whether is the analyzed phenomenon influence, or "autochthonic" idea of this outlook.

DE the problems of semantics of the metaphorical statements in the
   contemporary analytical philosophy; paradigms; models of semantics of
   metaphorical statements; literal and not literal meanings; non-semantic
   sign; Davidson
AB The article is devoted to the study of the problems of semantics of the metaphorical statements in the contemporary analytical philosophy. Analytical theories are considered within two paradigms - binary and unary. Theorists of a binary paradigm make the semantic analysis of metaphorical statements, that is << ... sees metaphor as a form of communication alongside ordinary communication; it conveys truths or falsehoods about the world much as plainer language does, though the message may be considered more exotic, profound, or cunningly garbed." [5, p. 174]. These theories lead to a binary model of semantics of metaphorical statements, which consists of two meanings: literal and not literal: M (+L (R) -L), where: M - metaphorical statement, +L - literal meaning, -L nonliteral meaning, R relations between literal and non-literal meanings. There are such theories, for example:
   1. The theories of double reference (Goodman, Ricoeur) -(<<+L >>/<<-L >>) and ([left perpendicular <<+L >> right perpendicular ] <<-L >>). Within this theories <<-L >> is a new (metaphorical) reference
   2. The theories of semantic interaction (Black) -((<<+L >>(a, b)) -> :<<-L >> (c)), where <<-L >> (c) -the new (non-literal) sense
   3. The theories of logical opposition (Beardsley) -(<<+L >> (a, b) > <<-L >> (a, b)), where <<+L >> (a, b) - logical opposition between the central meaning and that of other terms, there occurs that shift from central meaning to marginal meaning (<<-L >> (a, b) - italics - ours) which shows the word is to be taken in a metaphorical way" [ 10. P. 208].
   Contrariwise unary theories are based on unary model of semantics of metaphorical statements (as Davidson claimed " that metaphors mean what the words, in their most literal interpretation, mean, and nothing more" [ 5 173]): M (+L)*, where "+L" -literal meaning, * -non-semantic sign.. Non-semantic sign is main object of research in such theories. For example: 1) unusual seeing of objects (Davidson) 2) speaker's utterance meaning (Searle) 3) invitation to metaphorical transaction (Cohen), when " the speaker issues a kind of concealed invitation...", " the hearer expends a special effort to accept the invitation" and " this transaction constitutes the acknowledgment of a community" [ 7. P. 8]. Such theories are theories of an unary paradigm.

DE Ernst Mally; Alexius Meinong; idealism; theory of objects; epistemology
AB Our article centers on Ernst Mally's argument, which aims to refute "epistemological idealism" in several steps. The crucial element of Mally's argument is a paradox, that emerge in those cases, when we try to say that our thinking apprehends itself. This paradox of self-referential thinking plays for Mally crucial role in the refutation of the theses of "epistemological idealism". The first refutable "idealistic" thesis consists in saying that "object" means the same, as "that, which is conceived as conceived". The second refutable "idealistic" thesis consists in saying that every object is apprehendable. The third refutable "idealistic" thesis consists in saying that being is the same as being apprehended. "Epistemological idealism" under consideration is not identified by Mally with any kind of concrete historically given idealism (hence our employment of quotation marks in using term "idealism"). However, the so called "immanent philosophy" (Schuppe, Schubert-Soldern, Rehmke) perfectly falls under this concept, just because of its proceeding from the senselessness of any attempt to think about an object as independent from (this) thinking. As a positive consequence, Mally's argument demonstrates that epistemological position, presupposed by the meinongian "theory of objects" (so called "objectivism" (or "realism" in a loose sense)), is justified: "An object is what it is whether it is apprehended or not". Mally's argument, according to its intention, must show that object-theoretical studies, carried out in the school of A. Meinong, are devoid of even a grain of psychologism, despite the fact that the "theory of objects" is not possible without a "theory of apprehending of objects". Furthermore, rather speculative Mally's argument may be assessed as a "radical" expression of the struggle that the logic (in a form of the theory of objects) led for independence from psychologized epistemology. Mally's argument plays an important role in our understanding of the characteristic features of philosophical investigations in the school of A. Meinong. Meinong himself appreciate the paradox of self-referential thinking, exposed by Mally, as a threat for his own investigations. Meinong's theory of "defective objects" emerges precisely as a response to the paradox, exposed by Mally. Both the "Mally's paradox" and the Meinong's response to it become the points of issue for modern logicians.

DE intentionality; mental content; the conceptual role
AB Conceptual role semantics (CRS) is an approach to investigate intentional mental states basing on the idea of linguistic nature of thinking. The matters discussed in this paper are the ability of CRS to provide an acceptable criterion for the content of functional states and also some advantages and difficulties that occur when CRS is used to describe mental content itself. The problem of criterion for the content of functional states is closely connected with the problem of differing intrinsic and derived intentionality, in Searle's terms. CRS does not explain genesis of intrinsic intentionality but gives some account of it by analyzing so-called conceptual roles. The main assumption of CRS is that thought has content because it consists of concepts, each of which have syntactic and semantic properties that is supposed by the subject himself to be stable enough to use this concept in reasoning. Being the extension of the theory of meaning in use CRS is faced to the characteristic problems of this theory, such as the rule-following problem and the problem of grounding the principle of compositionality. The ways to solve them are barely outlined at best. For all that CRS seems to be able to cope with some other problems better than classical semantic theory. Specifically, it provides more plausible way to interpret indexical concepts and gives simpler account of the logical form of thoughts.

DE language policy; linguistic diversity; national language; national
   identity
AB Today, most states at least in some case may be characterized as culturally diverse. International dialogue of scientists and artists, qualified migration and student mobility leads to the situation where in most countries significant numbers of people belong to different cultures. And that's not taking into account the indigenous peoples with their distinctive cultures. The problem arises precisely from the fact that many culturally distinctive people want to comfort live in the country where they grew up or came in, so the authorities must organize a collective democratic community within the country. In this connection the question arises: to what extent the cultural diversity can consider as acceptable and tolerable and how to ensure harmony in these circumstances? When within a single society coexist people with different cultural traditions, it is necessary to solve a number of problems, to provide and arrange all the rules of social life and to determine the range of rights and responsibilities of individuals and communities. Because to solve these issues is not easy, governments have to choose between different options of language policy. One such option is a monolingual language policy, and as noted by A. Patten, such language policy, tending to linguistic convergence is useful for countries with different points of view. Firstly, such a language policy provides social mobility for all non-carriers of the state language, giving them the opportunity to show their loyalty and get access to all major public institutions. Secondly, the presence of prestigious single-language mediator can effectively build a collective identity of citizens and, thirdly, to provide a quick and efficient exchange of views within the state, which is very important for any democratic state. Finally, fourthly, one obligatory state language allows to minimize expenses on state transfers and bilingual communication that determines the economic value of a language policy. The ways of resolving these issues in the framework of language policy are based on two basic concepts: attitudes towards languages and respect for the linguistic rights. In this paper we analyze the monolingual language policies of different countries in terms of their normative content in the major legal sources, such as the constitutions, administration and special language legislation. According to this analysis it is clear, that states, conducting monolingual language policy, consider the state language as a tool of internal integration, where it serves not only as a function of the general mediator of communication, but also as an important political symbol. States focused on the preservation of national policy, adhere to monolingualism, which means a special, privileged position of language (in relation to the other) in order to unite the communities within the state as well as achieve a number of objectives that contribute to maintaining the stability of the political regime.

A brief description of these aims is given. The paper is concerned with the mathematical rationale. According to the mathematical rationale, G. Frege believed that whatever admits to proof ought to be proved. And he thought that the propositions of arithmetic, hitherto unproved, admit of proof and should be proved. Aspects of neo-logicism, questioning the feasibility of mathematical aims of G. Frege in the framework of the program, are problematized. It is concluded about the solution of this problem in the framework of the project of neo-logicism of C. Wright and B. Hale.

DE subjective time perception; figure; ground; overcoming a dualism
AB We are faced with the problem of defining of nature of time when we considering the time. Time as a constant, as a permanent, mixes with the man always. Time is felt as a resource witch depends on the person. Time is felt as an object that can be manipulated. However, a man can manage time only through self-management, redefinition, understanding of existence and his inner self. There is a problem: the one is trying to take control of what he himself controls. The man as the creator of time instantly becomes his victim. This desire reduces the one side of the phenomenon. We propose to interpret time as having both objective and subjective characteristics at the same time. Try to study time as a holistic object, not by its parts: the subjective and the objective (more or less), it perhaps with the help of the achievements of the psychology of perception, Gestalt psychology, and then linguistics adopt their methods of investigation. Rejecting the simplicity of time, we submit the form of time as eternally successive figures and grounds. The simultaneous adoption of the two alternatives is not something new, but the understanding and acceptance of the necessity to discard the dualism requires effort. This is contrary to human nature - or share everything on the contrary, highlights the extremes, either not properly averaged, excluding not only the existence but also the essence. The article gives examples of theories where the border and simplicity are rejected, cause that does not reflect the reality in favor of the alternatives are approved at the same time cause that reflect the reality in its entirety. Time in different conditions can look very different, that in turn makes us the impression of "simplicity" and "complexity". The complex nature of time reconciles opposites. The problem of time is essentially a problem of complexity - the cognitive relationship between subject and environment, with the proviso that both parts of the system included the study object. The time is no simple, single essence; the forms of time are equal and unequal at the same time, isomorphic, singular and gestalt.

AB The aim of this paper is to explore how from an early age a person acquires an intuitive ideas about what are the thought and language, and how they relate to each other. The sum of intuitions of this kind can be called naive semantics, which is often one of the main targets for philosophical criticism. The overall objective of the paper is to show that such criticism is largely underestimates the value of naive semantics for our intellectual development and cognition, and that it usually incorrectly describes the origins of naive semantics. In particular, the use of mentalistic idioms that characterize naive semantics is not a secondary or parasitic functioning of language, but a necessary and preliminary step in mastering of abstract, including scientific, concepts.

DT Article
DE universalism; repressions; heterogeneity; relativism
AB The paper considers the problem of overcoming repressions, which are produced by the scientific and philosophical systems, which are pretending to be universal. Repressions originate from the position of the classical universalism that all the knowledge must be incorporated in rigorous system. In its turn, a system is legitimized by a metanarrative. Ideas, which are not blended with the universal requirements, drop out from the "normal" scientific or philosophical knowledge. In order to overcome repressions, produced by universalism, Lyotard and Rorty suggest anti-universalistic approaches. In this paper were analyzed conceptions of the local language games, which mainly concentrated around the idea of defending the heterogeneity and uniqueness of all discourses. Nevertheless, in such conceptions there are ontological and ethical presuppositions, which could be qualified as universalistic. Thus, however, such universalism could be marked as "soft", because even though it presupposes some sort of general conditions, they are not becoming a philosophical foundation in the classical sense. The paper shows, that they mainly served for providing a prevention of repressions and they focused on the differences maintenance. Nonetheless, because of denying of the strong universalism, Lyotard and Rorty don't achieve a general elimination of repressions. Therefore, their concepts appeal rather to the ethical identity of each participator of all language games.

It is demonstrated that practical philosophy of the early Wittgenstein in his "Tractatus" had a little influence on Ramsey. In its turn, the Ramsey's concept of philosophy as a logical system of definitions, developed in his works (1927-1929), having a dynamic impact on the structure of the language meaning, influenced the change of Wittgenstein's views greatly, namely his concept of the meaning in use.

The author analyzes the thesis vertical, its governing bodies and the geographical distribution of dissertation councils. The highest governing body that controls the activity of dissertation councils in the country is the Supreme Attestation Commission under the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation. However, it meets at least two times a year and is composed of people, very busy on their core business. So really directs the work of dissertation councils Department of the Ministry of Education and Science. The author states that in Russia there are about 70 dissertation councils. They are distributed unevenly. 24 dissertation councils operate in Moscow and St. Petersburg. 25 dissertation councils operate in the European part of Russia. 14 dissertation councils operating in Siberia and the Urals. This situation is not satisfactory. The author puts forward the proposal for decentralization of the thesis, the transfer of many functions in the awarding of degrees of the leading universities of Russia. He also reflects on the communicative nature of the rituals thesis defense and tries to understand the functions of the main actors of protection. He believes that there are irrational and rational basis in the activities of the Dissertation Council as a social group, performing a ritual to determine the readiness of the applicant to independent research. He is trying to reveal the obvious and hidden side of the main participants of the ritual behavior, namely the applicant, his supervisor, board members, Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Scientific Secretary.

ID ACCOUNTABILITY; ATTRIBUTABILITY; ANSWERABILITY
AB It seems that there is collision between the contemporary legal practices and philosophical views on the moral responsibility of psychopaths. A number of philosophers and psychologists argue that psychopaths lack certain qualities necessary for moral personhood and so can't be held responsible. On the other side courts often try these cases and find the psychopaths guilty. In this article the author examines the arguments about the responsibility of psychopaths and comes to the conclusion that they should be held responsible even in the basic desert sense. The conclusion is based firstly on the conviction that psychopaths actually do possess necessary capacities, in particular capacity to treat others as persons and they possess moral competency. Secondly, it is based on the observation of similarities between the psychopaths and repeat offenders. Both kinds of criminals have an ill will and immoral character. The lack of empathy that is typical for the psychopaths cannot serve as an excuse and reason to withdraw accountability. The author of the article examines several objections to this view, but finds them unconvincing. So he concludes that the punishment of psychopaths is justified.

DE time; perception time; consciousness; psychophysical problem;
   neurophysiology; rhythm; duration; simultaneity; sequence
AB The problem of time perception is largely related with a psychophysical problem. First of all, there is the question can we reduce perception of time or some of its aspects to human brain properties or to human body properties at all, or may be it is based on collective society rhythms as E. Durkheim proposed, on language forms as B. L. Whorf thought, or just on habits as some postmodernists wrote. S. Rubinstein suggested the time perception conception based on at first on the sensations duration and on time perception in itself, which can be divided into two components: duration perception and sequences perception. On the assumption of scientific research results the four time perception aspects: rhythm, duration, simultaneity, sequence were revealed. It is confirmed by S. Rubinstein, A. Maklakov, L. Vekker's works and also by the last scientific researches including researches by Bradford university scientists which have discovered the "time channels" formation in the brain that remembers frequency and duration of events (2011), and also hyppocampus researches by scientist from Boston university (2011). MIT (2011, 2014), Californian institute (2014). Herewith, even if time itself is no more then a human illusion as some philosophers and even physicists believe, the perception of events sequences has a specific requirement in the directional realization of successive events series.

DT Article
DE Great Britain; U.S.; Russia; Anglo-American "special relationship";
   Britain's foreign policy; NATO; EU
AB The article is devoted to the Anglo-American "special relationship" maintaining under two U.S. governments of Barak Obama and two Britain's governments - the coalition government of David Ca-meron-Nicholas Clegg and the conservative government of D. Cameron. The paper covers the evolution of the bilateral relationship from worsening to improving, which came into being amid the American economic and military resources overheating due to the shift of the U.S. political interest from Europe to the Pacific region and overstretch of American military communications as a result. The author scrutinizes only two mane fields of this "special relationship": political and military cooperation. International events and political steps of both countries have rescued their relations from the collapse and have boosted them. The article deals with the role of such international crises as wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, combating the Islamic State (Islamic jihadists) and the Ukrainian crisis in preserving the speciality of Anglo-American relations. The author comes to a conclusion that Britain's participation in military operations around the world as the main partner of the U.S. is the main reason for improving the bilateral relationship. The attention is paid to the trends in cooperation making the relationship special, such as nuclear, sea and intelligence cooperation. The partnership between two countries in NATO is also highlighted. The author regards the movement for Scottish secession from the United Kingdom as one of political tendencies in the British society which bring uncertainties to Britain-U.S. relations. Special attention is paid to another political trend in the British society - the movement for Britain's exit from the European Union, which is a real threat for Anglo-American "special relationship", because it can ruin its traditional pillar - the bridge between the U.S. and Europe. The author tries to answer the question about perspectives of Anglo-American "special relationship" under the Cameron's government.

AB The transboundary resources management is the urgent issue where political, social, economic and environmental interdependences appear and where integrated development and management of transboundary resources and territories have the potential to yield the greatest success. More than half of the world's population depends daily upon water resources shared by more than one country. As the needs for this precious resource continue to increase, the imperative for cooperation between countries for better managing this resource has never been greater. New means are required to better manage water resources at every possible scale; especially in the highly complex situation of transboundary waters.

AB Mixed methods research is often used in studies involving young people. One of the key social problems in Russia today is low birth rates. However, there is little mixed methods research done into young people's ideas about family and parenthood. This paper presents the results of research into the views on family and parenthood held by young people in Russia. The study uses convergent mixed methods design. We analysed data from two quantitative and one qualitative study. The use of mixed methods research has enabled us to conclude that family is one of the key life values for young people in Russia. They hold a positive image of family in their minds. Thus at the cognitive and emotional levels, there is a stable belief in the importance of family and children. This enables us to speak about the absence of a fundamental crisis of the family institution in Russian society, despite vigorous political and scientific debate on the issue. This study also offers further research directions based on the findings and results.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Turkey; Justice and Development Party; economic stabilization;
   democratization; Kurdish question; savings level of national economy;
   current account deficit; middle income trap
AB The article investigates the main achievements and failures in Turkey's economic and social development during the period of the Justice and Development Party (JDP) in power (since 2002). The major successes of the JDP government are related to attainment of financial and economic stability, which created a base for sustainable economic growth with the help of the increasing inflow of foreign direct investments. At the same time, the social policy of the state has become more active, including noticeable achievements in solving the housing problem. Certain positive developments were attained in the democratization process, particularly in expanding civilian control over the military elites and reducing the likelihood of military involvement in domestic political processes, as well as in terms of ethnic minorities rights recognition (primarily of Kurds). As for negative trends during the JDP period, they refer to the so-called majoritarian understanding of democracy with an inevitable emergence of new social strata excluded from the official system of interest groups. This has ultimately led to the restriction of identification possibilities for secular segments of the population, who share classical values of Turkish republicanism and secularism. Such understanding of democracy has inavoidably resulted in establishing of control over media, restrictions on the freedom of speech, growth of intolerance towards the opposition, politicization of the judicial system, etc. The article also discusses tactical moves, to which the JDP elite and the President of Turkey R.T. Erdogan (who has close ties with the ruling party) have resorted in order to ensure the party's victory in the early parliamentary elections of November 2015. They took place once, prior to the June elections where JDP failed to win the majority required for forming a single-party government. Essentially, a hostage to the JDP's victory was the Kurdish problem, on which JDP had to radicalize its positions in order to get back the voices of nationalist-minded voters and, at the same time, to reduce popularity of the Pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party - another competitor for electorate. But, as a result, the split between political groups in the country over disagreements on the question of democratic freedoms was supplemented by the rift between national groups. The economic situation in Turkey is also not stable enough, because its economic prosperity relied heavily on active use of external financing. The decrease in its availability due to changes in the international financial market actualizes the threat of falling into a so called middle income trap with long period of low economic growth. Therefore, although JDP had managed to re-obtain the status of a ruling party, the price of victory is high: the country and its government will have to face a number of challenges and serious problems in the economy, internal and foreign policy. The lack of capability to find a constructive response to them can lead to radicalization in the nature of political power in Turkey.

This was followed by futile attempts to form a coalition Government. The author focused attention on the causes of the defeat in the elections of the two traditional competitors the People's Party and the Spanish Socialist Workers' party and on the success of the two newcomers to the lower house of parliament - parties "Syudadanos" ("Citizens") and "Podemos" ("We can"). The main problem in the formation of the coalition government was not only the fragmentation of the parliament, but also the ideological incompatibility of the four parties.

DT Article
DE A.I. Kim; elections; electoral law; legislation on elections
AB Domestic state-legal thought occupies a unique place in the world political and legal science. During the 19th and 20th centuries Russia became one of the centers of formation and development of the modern state and legal sciences. Today it is possible to assert an independent scientific heritage of domestic experts in studying the state, which includes statement of fundamental theoretical problems and proposals for their resolution. Scientific heritage as a cultural-historical intellectual domain of Russian society and its study by contemporaries is a key to the reconciliation of generations and the moral rehabilitation of the state-legal life. Respect for the scientific heritage of different socio-political periods as a spiritual and intellectual potential of Russia is able to remove the ideological differences and evaluation. Therefore, the scientific heritage of our teachers, that is, of people who directly influenced the formation of our consciousness and world outlook on a daily basis, has a particular importance. And here it is necessary to recall the scientific heritage of A. Kim, a recognized Soviet expert in studying the state, a social activist. The article discusses the value of scientific heritage which is the theoretical source of the new constitutional philosophy. The uniqueness of the scientific legacy of A. Kim is that he was able to overcome the narrowness of law and its enforcement in his time. For modern Russian constitutional-legal science the view on the electoral system and its difference from other institutions of constitutional law is interesting and relevant. The electoral system is an element of democracy. The study of the scientific legacy of A. Kim is an incentive for a new reading of the state-legal literature of the Soviet period and new studies based on it. For modern Russian constitutional legal science the problem of lack of voters is perspective. The modern expert community points out some reasons for a decline in the voter turnout. In his works, A. Kim emphasized that civic engagement in the elections is a multifactorial phenomenon and requires constant scientific research. The first modern findings support the position of the famous Soviet scientist. A low voter turnout significantly reduces the value of voting and influences the level of legitimacy. Therefore, in today's post-modern society with the rise of social difficulty, it is necessary to reduce the impact of manipulative technologies. According to the scientific legacy of A. Kim, it is possible to make a constructive conclusion that democracy is the lack of gap between the declared constitutional will and the real will of the people which is achieved on the basis of actual and broad participation of citizens in solving social problems.

TI HIGHER EDUCATION AS A TOOL OF POLITICAL POWER IN THE THIRD REICH

LA Russian
DT Article
DE The Third Reich; teachers and students of universities of Germany; Nazi
   policy of national community; higher education
AB The article considers the changes of the traditional concept of German education that always paid a great attention to the development of personality. The article analyses preconditions and consequences of nazification of higher education and gives examples how students and teachers of German higher schools of that time reacted to these changes. Right after the Nazi had come to power totalitarian principles were put into practice in all aspects of German education, which considerably deteriorated the development of science and the quality of students' training. Many academicians and professors openly supported not only Hitler's dictatorship, but also its anti-Semitism. Teachers and students of other than an Aryan origin began to be dropped out of universities. According to some rectors, university was to be integrated into a national community and merge with the state. The Nazi system of higher education was developed to both physically and ideologically prepare not only elite personnel but also the whole generation of German youth for the service in the Third Reich, which means for the war. At the same time the number of students as well as undesirable teachers decreased, according to statistics. The article shows the role of the National Socialist Union of Students in winning student youth over to the new power's side. Against a background of the Nazi public mood in the society that was heated by the patriotic propaganda, students did not resist the repressions of their colleagues and recent idols; moreover, they enthusiastically started realizing "the great mission" of the German nation. Persecution and dropping of undesirable teachers out of universities became typical of Germany of that time. On account of this, 20 % of the teaching staff was fired. Despite the general tendency and an open terror there were scientists in German higher educational establishments for whom science did not have nationality. Some of them ventured to defend their suspect colleagues whose talent they could not do without. The article gives an example of a students' protest against the ruinous ideology of the ruling regime. Thus, German education and German universities suffered great moral and material damage which appeared to be profitable to the rest of the world. Thousands of talented scientists emigrated from Germany and successfully continued their scientific and teaching activity in other countries. During the 12 years of the totalitarian regime the process and content of German higher education changed so much that it took years to return its former quality and appeal on the world level.

DT Article
DE Pakistan; demographic upsurge; globalization; parliamentary-cum-military
   regime; Afghanistan; Taliban; Islamic State (ISIS)
AB The author highlights an almost unprecedented growth of Pakistan's population. He believes that the population census of 2011, unfinished due to some home policy reasons, gives a true picture of the demographic upsurge encompassing primarily north-western and western periphery of Pakistan. The population explosion results in the six-fold increase in less than 70 years averaging 3% annually. This phenomenon combined with ecological problems worsening in the Indus basin, which constitutes the heartland of the country, augurs not well for the future. At the present stage of globalization, Pakistan experiences the increasing out-migration of labor force, mainly to the Middle East. The rapid growth of private transfers from abroad amounting to almost a half of the export earnings can be considered an asset for the economy. The negative side of globalization is revealed in the slowing pace of industrial development due to low internal demand. Investments in the energy sector and infrastructure were lagging behind because the ruling political-cum-military circles neglected them. The author distinguishes between the upper crust of politics and its lower tier. The latter is dominated by the landed (feudal) aristocracy and tribal chiefs. Their power in the vast semi-desert areas to the west from the Indus basin is being now challenged by Islamic militants of different shades and sects. The spread of Islamists is traced to the influence of the long Afghan civil war on Pakistan. Analyzing the today's Afghan crisis the author considers three scenarios, one of which is favorable for the present regime in Afghanistan while the other two are unfavorable envisaging the return of the Taliban to power or the actual fragmentation of Afghanistan. The last scenario foresees the talibanization of Afghanistan's South and East, with its West and central part tilting towards Iran, North-towards Central Asia, and a generally unpredictable interplay of Islamic and counter-Islamic forces and factions throughout the country. The author refers to the economic cooperation between Pakistan and Russia as a factor, which can contribute to Pakistan's and indirectly Afghanistan's progress and stability.

DE Reformation; charity; rationalization
AB Studying the phenomenon of charity is of particular interest for philosophers, historians, and leaders of society. However, in the Soviet period, this issue was not examined at all, for political reasons. Nonetheless, charity has always reflected the level of socio-economic development of society and the state of moral culture and civilizational maturity of society. Therefore analysis must take into account three elements of charity in Russia: the historical background (context), the concept, and the practice of charity.
   This article is aimed at studying the transformation of Christian charity at the beginning of the New Time and the analysis of changes ongoing in this sphere. The authors of this research start with the analysis of the situation that had been formed in the economy, culture and activity of the Roman Catholic Church in the late Middle Ages. Such a preliminary excursion into the historical domain is not coincidental. It assists understanding the reasons for the Reformation and later events. However, "in the beginning was the Word", therefore, the text analyzes the ideas of such founding fathers of Protestantism as Martin Luther, John Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli. The new ideology along with the sociocultural and socioeconomic factors promoted the formation of a radically different and more creative social system, also including the charity sphere that became more rational, practical and rough. The purpose of the article is the analysis of changes in this area.
   In the XV century there was a latent preparation of the reformation period of European history. Cities played the large role in this process. The French historian F. Braudel called the cities the electrical transformers that increase the voltage, increase exchange, change people's lives. In the cities there was a very different kind of communication between individuals based on social differentiation of the inhabitants. The reflection of changes in the late Middle ages begins just in cities and there were born innovative activities, new organizational forms, technologies, management practices. In the cities there were such progressive types of private charitable institutions such as almshouses, hospices, houses of mercy, and later hospitals, etc. The City is always creative, even in the ritual, stagnant era. The attitude towards charity was also changed. The main trend of the charity development in the period under review became the rational support, but hard and not yet targeted.

DE social and labour relations; small and medium-sized business
AB The purpose of this study was to examine the specifics of the Russian model of interactions of social and labour relations actors in small and medium-sized businesses. The empirical research was considered on relationships of modern employees and employers of small and medium-sized businesses with trade unions, the Association of industrialists and entrepreneurs, the employment service and recruitment agencies. The following methods were used for the collection and analysis of empirical data: 1) questioning 500 employees of small and medium enterprises; 2) content analysis of semi-structured interviews with owners of 68
   owners of enterprises small and medium-sized businesses; 3) expert interviews with representatives of trade unions, the Association of industrialists and entrepreneurs, services employment and recruitment agency. The analysis of questionnaires and interview research focus was directed on the general nature and assessment of relations between workers and employers with target us agents. We cleared out the fact of the existence of this interaction, reasons why it occurs or is missing, the nature and methods of these interactions, its effectiveness and the problems.
   Exploring the unique set of empirical data, the author concludes that in the modern model of social and labour relations in small and medium business is almost completely absent of such classic lines of communication as "worker-trade union" and "employer-association of industrialists and entrepreneurs". The interaction of the two main actors: workers and employers with the employment services and recruitment agencies are not decisive in the overall scheme of social and labour interactions (although for workers is probably closer to the employment services and for employers - recruitment agencies).
   The research results are of interest as one of the stages of exploring common models of modern social and labour relations in small and medium business, which will generate the optimal strategy of joint action actors, which in turn will contribute to social stability in the society as a whole.

TI PROBLEMS OF LATIN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AS INTERPRETED BY RESEARCHERS

DT Article
DE democracy; stability; conflicts; social policy; social protest
AB The article deals with problems of the modern Latin American democracy in the context of various research methods, factors of stability and proneness to conflict, as well as new challenges for democracy set by the developing modern society. The author analyzes the leading experts' opinions in the field - mainly Spanish and Latin American researchers involved in modern social and political problems. Much attention is given to: political development issues in the region; transformation of the political parties' and civil society's role in response to consolidation of Latin American democracies; the youth activity as a new political phenomena; the increase of social protests, and the phenomenon of exaggerated social expectations. The important role of the social policy in stabilization of the political situation in the region, as well as in a successful democratic consolidation process is noted. Almost all countries of the region used the period of economic prosperity and growth (2003-2013) to develop and implement a targeted social policy aimed at the social sphere development, employment growth, and the improvement of education and public health systems. But the majority of successful social projects were devoted mainly to solving the most daunting and morbid problem of the Latin American society-poverty, which has been significantly lowered. Thus, the state targeted social policy played a significant role in shaping a positive attitude towards democracy. However, even over a ten-year period of economic growth, a state was unable to solve all problems accumulated. These challenges have been left unattended. It poses a serious threat to political stability. It is noted that the assessment of the democratic development prospects in the leading countries is closely related to social pessimism, which has been spreading among different classes of the Latin American society in recent years, and is associated not only with the worsening economic situation, but also with the growing disappointment in possibilities of democracy itself. Ineffective public administration, bureaucratization of state agencies and corruption cause irritation and discontent among the population. At the same time, along with criticism and emphasis on the subject of "disappointment" in politics, the commanding view among researchers is that the liberal democracy must be defended despite all its drawbacks and weaknesses, as the challenges for democracy set by the modern developing society, however serious they may be, are merely the tests of its prospects and possibilities, and not the evidence of its inconsistency.

There is an obvious discrepancy between the foreign and domestic policies of the UK, which was particularly evident when London joined the US invasion in Iraq in 2003. During the last two years, the United Kingdom has competed with the US and Canada in anti-Russian rhetoric, thus keeping itself from the process of settlement of the Ukrainian crisis. The question is detached on whether the country still masters the ability to think strategically, as its foreign policy has shrunk to the echo of the US foreign policy or is overshadowed by euroscepticism.

TI THE SUEZ CRISIS OF 1956: A TURNING POINT OF THE BRITISH FOREIGN POLICY?

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Suez Crisis of 1956; Great Britain; Anthony Eden; historiography of Suez
   Crisis; Hungary Crisis of 1956
AB The Suez Crisis of 1956 still attracts a keen interest of domestic and foreign, especially British, historians. The first decade of the 21st century noted a surge of monographs and articles devoted to a comprehensive and thorough study of the events of the autumn of 1956. This situation, first of all, refers to Western historiography; however, Russian historical science, responding to the opening of the archives of the United Kingdom and other countries, had new fundamental publications related to the history of the triple Anglo-French-Israeli intervention in 1956. In describing the events of the autumn of 1956, the author also touches upon the Hungarian Crisis that coincided with the triple Anglo-French-Israel intervention and had a significant impact on the discussion of the events in the area of the Suez Canal in the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations. Particular attention is paid to the reaction of the USA and the USSR on the Suez and Hungarian Crises. For the first time during the Cold War, Moscow and Washington were on the same side against the colonial powers and strongly condemned the military action against Egypt. At the same time, the White House could not use unrest in Hungary for propaganda purposes. The author, referring to the history of the events of the summer and autumn of 1956, builds material of the article around a search for an answer to the question of whether it is possible to consider the events of the autumn of 1956 a turning point of the British foreign policy. This formulation of the problem is due to the advent of the so-called revisionist trend in British historiography which presented a new view of events related to the implementation and consequences of the Suez operation against Egypt in 1956. Revisionists deny the Suez Crisis as a line after which the British policy in the Near and Middle East changed dramatically. However, questions remain about the impact of the events of the autumn of 1956 on the colonial policy and other areas of foreign policy of Britain. For the UK, the crisis highlighted the need to rethink the chosen strategy not only in the Middle East, but also in the matters of decolonization, which at the turn of the 1950s and 1960s acquired a prompt character in connection with the strengthening of the so-called "non-aligned movement" and the growth of the Asian and African countries in the UN. The Suez crisis had a clear impact on the political crisis in the country and had an important psychological impact on the perception of the country by the population and by the political elite. In the early 1957, Prime Minister Anthony Eden resigned and H. Macmillan became a new head of government. He put forward new initiatives in the field of colonial and European policy. A new chapter began in British history.

   Economic Belt); effectiveness of international organization
AB The article presents the idea that nowadays the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is a rapidly evolving "node" of a multipolar world, capable to oppose various global and regional risks. But despite the overall consolidation of the global stance of the SCO, the basic function of it refers to a regional level. The SCO's 2016 Model provides for the expansion of the regional agenda in view of the current deepening of the Central Asian disparities (growth of traditional and non-traditional threats to security, including related to the ISIS, economic recovery of some states and the decline of others, need to render aid to turbulent Afghanistan, etc.), as well as the conflict between the SCO key country, Russia, and the SCO observer state, Turkey. Despite the tangible success of cooperation within the SCO, discrepancy of interests of some member states is observed in terms of economic development. Therefore, Russia has to implement its own concept of Eurasian economic integration through the already functioning Customs Union (CU) and the "young" parallel project, the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) as well. The latter is especially topical due to the advancement by China of the Silk Road Economic Belt strategy. The authors draw some proposals to improve the efficiency of the SCO as an international organization. So, to ensure its further "peaceful rise" the SCO should not only develop new cooperative programs, but rather bring the old ones to the stage of practical implementation. Firstly, it is advisable to eliminate intraSCO discrepancies on a number of issues, among which are: general direction and motivation of the SCO activity in the foreseeable future (economic cooperation or military-strategic cooperation); political and economic discords between Central Asian countries enhancing the conflict potential in the SCO; efficiency of the relationship between the SCO and other organizations in the Central Asian area - the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and the newly formed EAEU; political maneuvering of Central Asian capitals between Moscow and Beijing along with the expansion of their contacts with doubtfully friendly non-regional forces, such as the US and the EU. Moreover, the authors see urgent helpfulness not only in hard-to-reach "high" integration notions, but also in "simple" cooperative initiatives associated with some practical economic activities within the SCO; as well as in increasing the financial self-reliance of the SCO by implementing settlements in national currencies and introducing a special SCO accounting unit, functionally similar to the "transferable ruble" of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in 1963-1991. The article concludes that for China the "project" of the SCO is only a particular case of the PRC's regional policy. And the higher the activity of China in other international structures, the more obvious will become the probability of Chinese resources "spillover" to non-SCO recipients; and for the Russian Federation the problem of increasing its competitiveness in other world "platforms".

AB The paper analyzes the programs, creating accessible environment at the experimental regions of Russia. The object of the survey is the state program "Accessible Environment" 2011-2015. The subject of the survey is implementation of the state program "Accessible Environment" 2011-2015 at the five experimental regions of Russia (Saratov region, Tver region, The Republic of Khakassia, The Republic of Tatarstan, The Udmurt Republic). The aim of the survey is analysis of implemented measures at specified regions within the framework of creating accessible environment (barrier-free environment). The tasks of the survey are: 1. To conduct historical excursus on creating an accessible environment and the development of sociological research. 2. To conduct a comparative analysis of activities in the following areas: ensuring the accessibility of accommodation and living environment, transportation and transport services, sport buildings and services in the field of sport, cultural facilities and services in the field of culture, social welfare and services in the field of social welfare, accessibility of medical organizations, health care facilities and services in the field of medicine and public health; providing access to facilities of the educational system and the provision of educational services; providing access to objects in employment and provision of services in the field of employment and occupation; providing access to Internet resources, communication devices and services in the field of information and communication. The main research method is a comparative documentary analysis. Additional method is expert interview (with representatives of Tatarstan ministries and non-governmental organizations).
   The main conclusion is an imbalance between large funding of some activities and low financing of some others. In addition, all of the programs implemented in the region, focused on the creation of accessible (or a barrier-free) physical environment. Regional agencies give a little attention to creating a positive attitude towards disabled people in society.

Fatherhood is characterized as a complex phenomenon formed as a result of interaction between normative societal regulations and individual attitudes emerging from father and child relationship and from the relationship between man and woman as parents. Father's role is slow and the "involved and caring father" is so far just the image present in the social consciousness.

DE risks; migrant students; new Russian Asians; fateful moments; avos' /
   tavakkalan
AB The steady growth of educational migration from Tajikistan to Russia and issues of enculturation of migrant students who are likely to stay in Russia raise the question of improving Russian language learning. The article, drawing on methodological approaches laid out in E. Giddens's, U. Beck's and N. Luhmann's work, studies this question through the prism of 'risk'. The habit of relying on avos' / tavakkalan or hope that things will somehow work out on their own is considered the subjective reason behind poor knowledge of the Russian language. It is believed that the quality of human capital acquired over the years at the university may result in the division of migrant students from Tajikistan into the successful 'new Russian Asians' who got well educated in Russia and achieved a lot and those who found themselves on the sidelines of life because of poor education. The latter may start harboring bad feelings toward the host society and join criminal or terrorist groups. The decision of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science making possible the learning of the Russian language instead of a foreign one is seen as a tool which will help better the quality of education. The article draws on in-depth individual interviews conducted by the author with students from Tajikistan, leaders of the Tajiik diaspora in Siberian cities, and the faculty of Tomsk universities as well as other host society members. It is written in the framework of the project 'Man in a Changing World. Identity and Social Adaptation: Past and Present' (the Russian government grant #14.B25.31.0009).

AB In the article based on the application of the economic approach to the philosophical and anthropological and cultural-philosophical studies analyzed the missionary project as a specific product of man as a manufacturer of religion. Describes the peculiarities of missionary project.
   In the first part of the article the author examines the relationship between processes of transformation of the status of religion in the culture and processes of transformation of the human. With the development of material and technical aspects of human existence is an increasingly growing share of economic factors in human existence, which is indicative of the completion of the modern transition from homo religious to homo economicus, when all anthropological phenomena, including religious, are determined by economic structure. On this basis, it is concluded on the need for an economic approach in line with the philosophical-anthropological and cultural-philosophical research that makes it relevant to the study of religious phenomena through the concept of economic human.
   In the second part of the article examines the changing nature of religion in modern society, to which the author's opinion, was influenced by two key processes: the process of de-secularization of society, such as the liberalization of religious policy the former Soviet Union in the early 90s of the twentieth century and the process of globalization.
   In the next part of the article discusses the conceptual provisions problem of religious market and the concept of economic man. The author notes that, according to economic approach religious space of modern Russia is an established and actively functioning market religions where religious organizations can be considered as firms openly competing with each other. In these conditions, man performs the following key roles: the role of "manufacturer of religion" and the role of "consumer religion".
   Further, the author goes on to direct analysis of missionary project. Shows that the missionary project is not just a product manufacturer of religion, but also a means of production used them to expand the organization and gain greater opportunities for influence on reality.
   In the last part of the article discusses the various types of missionary project based on the analysis of empirical sources, and are the factors that determine its content and quality.
   At the end of the article concludes on the need for economic-anthropological approach to the study of missionary activity, allowing for a new open features religious space post-secular cultures where the first place there is not "the truth of God" - the dogmatic rules and traditions of the religious organization, - but correctly made and implemented strategy of missionary project, the authorship of which belongs to a specific person.

The Volga Muslims (Tatars and Bashkirs) formed the main part of as members of the Muslim community, as the heads of Muslim religious organizations. In recent years the proportion of Caucasian and Central Asian Muslims is increased significantly. The growing number of Caucasian Muslims who are following to a politicized interpretation of Islam, causes to an open confrontation, both with the authorities and the rest of the Muslims autonomous region. The main factor influencing on the change in the ethnoreligious composition of the Muslim world of Ugra is active migration flows to the Autonomous Region from Muslim Russian regions and CIS countries. In the period under review these flows have been consistently high, including from "hot spots". It contributed in violation of the internal balance of the Muslim Ummah. According to information of law enforcement agencies in the region many cases have been reported when the representatives of the Islamist movement tried to recruit Muslims in Ugra for extremist activity. The unity of the Islamic Ummah in Ugra today is quite nominal, and the life of the Muslim community itself is filled with deep internal divisions. The article focuses on the issues of prevention of the manifestations of radical Islam and extremism in the Muslim world. Currently a program directed to harmonization of interethnic and intercultural relations is realized in the region.

AB In the article is analyzed the theoretical concepts of motivation in the system of public administration. It is defined, that this social institution is divided into four levels: the basic, the middle, the elite and the institutional level. On the basic level it is the personnel of public authorities, who carry out state functions by providing public goods. The supervisors of public authorities comprise the middle level. They manage the basic level and form the practice of application of law. The high level is the political elite, who perform state management. They have imperious powers, but don't solve practical problems. The norms, values and roles, which constitute the institutional level, are consolidating element of all system. Currently the motivation of civil servants is based on the theories, which is not considered the personal aspirations, needs and values of staff of governmental bodies. It is appropriately only for basic level of public administration. The results of research show that there is a gap between normative structure and incentive system, which leads to the increase of stress and reduction of the social contentment of governance. The main goal of motivation in the public administration is the activation of the high social potential of state services by transformation their activities from support of personal welfare to the ensure of quality of life of citizens. The motivation's management should account difference in the structure of motives and values between the levels of public administration. The motivation of high and middle levels should base on the assessment of personal aspirations, needs and values with regard to the principle of fairness, which requires a clear goal-setting and development of criteria for achieving these goals. The result of their work may depend on the level of welfare of the region or the economic success of the industry in which they carry out state management. Receiving material benefits or benefits for employees on the basic level should be linked to individual performance. This should take into account that their activities mainly lies in the interaction with society, and therefore assessment of their activity is advisable by the criterion of satisfaction of consumers of public services.

AB The topicality of the article is conditioned by a need for a special sociological theory that explains the patterns of medical care consumption. So, the present paper is devoted to the methodological problems of medical care consumption' categorization in sociological discourse. The purpose of article is to create a uniform methodological space of sociological study in the sphere of medical care consumption. The novelty of the work is expressed in the applying of metaparadigmality constructing to this phenomenon study. The concept of medical care consumption is analyzed as multidimensional, emotionally directed type of adaptive behavior designed by the individual in a wide social context. It's stressed that specificity of medical care consumption consists, first, in need of overcoming of objective and subjective accessibility barriers, secondly, in the alternativeness of a personal choice, thirdly, in subjectively "installable" strength of medical need. On one hand, sociological perspective views medical care consumption as a stage of individual disease career in the social relation system. On the other hand, sociological tradition is concerned with how institutional limitations and cultural program of society influence medical activity. It's argued that medical care accessibility is an integrative factor of consumer choice in the healthcare sphere. Thus, there is necessity to create a theoretical model which includes behavioral and structural factors of medical care accessibility. Particular attention is given to the possibility of integrating the cognitive installations of classical and nonclassical models of scientific rationality for better sociological understanding of medical care consumption dimensions. The task of modern sociology in Russia, in the opinion of the author, is to link the representations of various social groups about "optimal" help-seeking strategies with process of healthcare institute transformation on the national and regional levels. At the end of article the author emphasizes that sociological approach allows to reveal the hidden subjective and objective factors of medical care consumption, as well as to define the reasons and effects of obvious limitations in Russian healthcare system.

DE army; young people; patriotism; social attitudes; valued orientations
AB Nowadays positive estimates of the state of affairs can be observed in the Russian army. However, military service doesn't catch up with a schedule of an overwhelming majority of young people. Comparison of different age groups of youth proves that the quantity of those who are definitely not willing to enter the army is increasing with aging, as well as those who consider themselves not to be ready for entering the army. By the end of high school just a bit more than a tenth of army draftees tend to join the armed forces; to add more, among them not all consider themselves to be completely ready for doing military service.
   There is a significant difference in relation to the state of mind of pupils living in megalopolis and towns towards military service. The quantity of pupils living in megalopolis, who don't tend to enter the army and, moreover, have an excuse from military service, is twice as big as those who do.
   Pupils' attitude towards serving in the army, in the whole, and, particularly, towards serving in the armed forces is more likely to be negative. It is estimated that prevalence rate of military hazing and bullying amounts for the largest number of negative responses. But at the same time, most pupils point out a special place the army takes on the world stage, as well as its high prestige.
   Within life values of draft-age youth patriotism and serving Motherland are low valued. Health, favorite work and friendly family are, above all, the most important components of vital success. Resoluteness and manhood comprise the top ten of prime characteristics, too, though it is more common for them to be used in the context of successful career.
   Statistical methods of data grouping make it possible to separate groups of young people guided by different life values. One of those groups includes such values as serving one's own Motherland and its defense, patriotism, as well as faith and religion. According to a number of estimates, focus on power and wealth is the opposite to this group. The third group is focused on the family and the fourth one - on realization of personal potential in profession and career.
   Pupil's attitude towards military service is strongly influenced by their parents' attitude. Teenagers' parents, guided by patriotism and serving their Motherland, are distinguished by comparatively strong advertency towards the future of their child. Their attitude towards the army is positive, thus, they definitely advise or even insist on entering the army.

DE dance; "male"; "female"; gender; body; physicality; androcentrism;
   dualism
AB The author of article "Masculinity in dance or" real men do not dance !? "deals with the problems of philosophy understanding of dance and gender representation in dance. The key moment of the author's reasoning is the comparative analysis of the essential characteristics of the human.
   The author, Candidate of Philosophical Sciences, Associate Professor at the department of Humanities and Socio-Economic disciplines of Omsk Tank-Automotive Engineering Institute, social dancing choreographer Zhaparova Aliya Kairgeldievna. The author of this article had the task of explaining the reasons of stigmatization of dance as a sphere of "female" and understanding of explication of masculinity in dance.
   The essence of the problem is reduced to passivity of philosophy to the dance, which is associated primarily specificity of the material - the human body, which has been a taboo subject for the Western European Christian society, and also the philosophical tradition recognized the primacy of the mind over the body. In such a way the dance by and large refers to the "philosophy of physicality" discourse.
   The main part of this article provides a comparison of binary oppositions in the descriptions of the essential characteristics of human in Western philosophy, in which preference is given to the characteristics traditionally belonging to "male". This in turn explains the reasons of the normative dualism in culture.
   In conclusion, the author leads the reader to idea of the possibility of overcoming the dualism by seeking broader forms of rationality, and dance in this sense can be an important resource as the dance material is a living body. In dance, the body can be represented in the masculine and feminine aspects.
   Therefore, the assertion that the natural flexibility, plasticity, special rhythms of the female body are in aggregate basis "predisposition" to dance according to the author is not quite correct. There are stereotypes in modern society that claim dance as something "female", but they are nothing more than the result of misconceptions about the nature of the dance.

DE contemporary otkhodniks; socioeconomic types of otkhodniks; domestic
   temporary labour migration; provincial society
AB The article deals with investigation of how economic behavior of the contemporary Russian otkhodnik (domestic temporary labor migrant) impacts his social status. The ideas of human capital theory are used. The author considers otkhodniks' knowledge and skills to determine the level of income according to their uniqueness, and defines them as "professional competence specificity". Otkhodniks' abilities, in their turn, should be considered from the perspective of readiness to endure harsh living and working conditions at the job site; the author defines them as "adaptability". Professional competence specificity and adaptability become the parameters for otkhodniks' economic behavior typology. The combination of "high" and "low" values of the parameters allows determining four socioeconomic types of otkhodniks: "maximalists", "fastidious", "drudges", and "standing about". "Maximalists" have unique skills, work and live in harsh conditions, earn big money and have a high status in their local community. They are carpenters who erect houses in the suburbs of major cities, and "rotation workers" in the extractive industries who work outdoors. This type prevails in the forest regions of the European part of Russia. "Fastidious" otkhodniks have unique skills and avoid working and living in harsh conditions; by their material situation they are similar to the local residents successfully employed in their hometown or village. They are communications technicians and otkhodniks who make repairs and renovate premises for wealthy clients. These otkhodniks are least of all integrated in the local social structure. "Drudges" do not have unique skills and endure harsh working and living conditions. They are respected by the local community; their earnings allow them to have a "decent" lifestyle, comparable with the lifestyle of locals successfully employed at the place of residence. They are builders, truckers, loggers, factory workers and "rotation workers" in the extractive industries who work indoors. "Standing about" otkhodniks do not have unique skills and avoid working and living in harsh conditions. They offer the employer only their presence and perform the simplest jobs. These are otkhodniks occupied in security, trade, catering and domestic services. Their earnings are lower than the amounts that people working locally receive. Their status in the local community is not high. This type is more frequent in the agricultural regions of the European part of Russia.

TI TRANSFORMATION OF CHINA'S RELATIONS WITH THE NOMADIC PEOPLES OF CENTRAL

DT Article
DE China; Central Asia; ethno-cultural contacts; Middle Ages
AB This article considers various aspects of China's relations with the nomads of Central Asia, which are associated with the relocation of neighboring peoples to the northern border of the empire. The major feature of this ethno-political situation was that the state and political union of northern China provided objective conditions and opportunities for close interaction and most progressive cultural unification of various peoples of the empire on the basis of the ancient culture. China's policy in relation to the surrounding nomadic peoples, especially in Central Asia, is significantly different in some historical periods, although the strategy was always the same: to maximize the sphere of influence in the surrounding area and, at the same time, to protect the population of their state against external aggression. At the initial stage, China solved this problem trying to distance the nomads from their borders and to maximally fence off from their penetration. However, protection of the borders with defensive constructions was expensive and did not bring the desired results. Then policy towards nomads was revised and a new tactics of struggle was used. For its implementation some of the tribes were moved to the borders of China. Their coming to the Chinese land was due to the resettlement policy carried out by the Chinese court in order to use nomads in the fight against external enemies. This helped to reduce the armed invasion that China's nomadic neighbors made in times of its weakening. However, it was the direct cause which marked the beginning of the rule in China of nearly two dozen public entities of nomads. These events led to the beginning of mass migration of the Chinese to the south of the Yangtze basin. The "southern barbarians" also moved. The migration of different ethnic groups fundamentally changed the population in large parts of Eastern Asia. This time is characterized by mutual coexisting of fundamentally different ways of life of nomadic and agricultural civilizations. Thus, the problem of ethnic and cultural contacts with the non-Chinese peoples on the territory of China in the early medieval period reveals an important feature of the Chinese civilization that consists in the fact that all the introduced elements gradually adapted and became elements of the Chinese culture. On the other hand, the rule of the steppe peoples who invaded the north of China had a significant impact on the formation of the Chinese ethnicity in the early Middle Ages.

TI METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES IN RUSSIAN AND FOREIGN FOLKLORISM RESEARCH
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE folklorism; methodology; cultural heritage
AB The research is relevant due to ethnic elements popularization in social, political (use of electorate's local ethnic culture in political party's work) and economic (tourism) life spheres. The aim of this article is to show the main methodological approaches in foreign and Russian folklorism research. The term folklorism was suggested in 1962 by German ethnologist Hans Moser. He wrote that the folklorism is "second-hand mediation and presentation of folk culture". Moser meant most popular folklore elements transformation for shows and performances. But he did not suggest any methodological approach for the new concept. Several years later, another German scientist Herman Bausinger suggested his methodological approach in which he especially noted the role of media, scientific organisations, the most popular form of folklorism (e.g., use of indigenous dress), regional folklorism (e.g., Bavaria in Germany). More methodological approaches to folklorism are described in American, Slovenian and Russian ethnological research works. In his research on the kappa belief and its transformation from folklore to folklorism, American folklore researcher Michael Dylan Foster used a historical-genetic method, document analysis, mapping, a historical periodization method, structure functional and system analysis. Irina A. Kolobkova was interested in clay toys as a modern folk decorative art. She used observation, interview, photo fixation, comparative analysis. The following conclusions and summary can be made from the above: 1. According to historiography, the author has formed an operational hypothesis: folklorism research uses system analysis methodological approaches. It means integrity, transformation of social institution system constitutive relation under the environmental influence. Traditional historical methods (comparative analysis, document analysis, field work and other) are also used; 2. Folklorism study uses quantity and quality sociological and ethnological methods (overview, interview, public opinion polls, content analysis); 3. There are no principal differences in foreign and Russian folklorism methodological approaches.

   employment; remuneration of workers; demographic situation; social

AB The crisis affecting Russia provokes risks of rising unemployment, reducing real incomes, growing poverty, worsening demographic situation and other negative social trends. It accentuates acute structural problems challenging future human development, threatening with social and economic degradation of Russia. Workforce employment structure by economic activity and occupation lacks economic efficiency and social reasonability. Poor state of labor protection results in high incidence of work accidents. Obsolete labor regulations prevent the employment adjustment to reindustrialization shocks. Huge and unfair gaps in workers remuneration by economic activity, region and occupation cause high income inequality. Low level of remuneration in many economic activities, including those contributing to modernization of economy, leads to high working poverty and low attractiveness of innovative sectors to workers. Persistent low fertility, high mortality and low life-spam engender unsupportable demographic development and risks of restarting depopulation. Uncontrolled immigration of unqualified workforce from developing Asian countries is a source of growing social, ethno-cultural and political tensions. There are risks of growing emigration and turning flows of adaptive migrants away from Russia to EU. Structural and institutional reforms are to be realized to counteract these problems and risks and overcome crisis. Such measures are to get over the unjustified unbalances in employment and remuneration distribution, to form new competences and professional attitudes and raise stability of demographic development, supply of labor resources and boost their productivity. These changes may create social premises for transition to economic growth of new quality based on frontier technologies, wide innovations and high human development. At the same time high-tech economy development poses challenges of high unemployment, and labor market policies are to maintain balance between the needs of conserving stable employment and realizing economic transformations. Solution of many acute national problems should be based of complex approach, supposing package type of measures and simultaneity of social and economic reforms.

AB Today Russia is often being criticized for new legislative initiatives in the field of Internet communications. Laws in this area are often negatively perceived by online community and critics and are the cause of misunderstanding between the government and society. Russia, however, is not the only country that has attempted to regulate its online sphere. World practice shows that many states are seeking to regulate virtual life of society. Such initiatives are indeed useful and necessary. The world today is shifting to a new reality where virtual space will play an increasingly important role, but it will raise many dangers and challenges that are needed to be solved at the legislative level. The regulation of the Internet is at the junction of legislation and politics as it is directly concerns the interests of society, the rights and freedoms of the individual, so it is impossible to resolve these problems in isolation from political science and sociology. This article contains a brief review of the legislation in the field of Russian Internet and in some countries, and represents an attempt to determine a necessary level of government intervention in the Internet and the level of its regulation.

DE "The other legend"; Moscow; symbol of the Russian throne; the power
   symbol; the symbol of the Moscow State; B. Godunov; False Dmitry I
AB The theme and image of Moscow acquires special significance in the periods of severe historical and political ordeals. The compiler of "The other legend", the compilatory monument dedicated to the events of the Time of Troubles, is interested in the history of the capital, its image only in historical and political aspect. The episodes of related themes that mention the toponym Moscow, are different artistically and are characterized by different degrees of dissemination of the narrative. Stories about the accession to the throne of B. Godunov, V. Shumsky, the approval of the board of seven boyars are lapidary, they focus is not so much on the city itself, as on Muscovites and their reactions. Stories of False Dmitry I. I. Bolotnikov uprising and P. Gorchakov et al. are characterized by detailed narrative about how those going to the throne conquered Moscow and tried to capture it. In both types of narrative Moscow appears as a symbol of the Russian throne, the power symbol, the symbol of all the Moscow State. The difference in the description is partly due to very specific starting positions of the power-hungry people, particularly, their location: if the attempts to seize the throne were from inside or outside. Depending on their location and ideological attitudes the compiler chooses different narrative storytelling models, which are at times contrasting from the biblical archetype to the protocol ceremonies, as in the case of the conquest of Moscow, Boris Godunov and the False Dmitry I. Each of the contenders for the throne is using its own methods of conquest of the city, from verbal persuasion to direct threats and reprisals against residents. And each of them gives special importance to the conquest of Moscow, not only because it is reigning city, but also because it is the mother of cities of the Russian land.

AB This study is devoted to the consideration of such a phenomenon as financial determinism, and the definition of its role in the socio-economic development of Russia. In addition to the review of characteristics, disclosure of the scope and content of the subject of determinism and of financial determinism in particular, the author traces the evolution of the determining factors in the historical context, and also fixes the formation of financial determination in the world community. Based on the data, the author focuses on the analysis of Russia's position in world politics and the financial system. The author notes the uniqueness of the situation and determines the appropriate direction and prospects for further development of the situation. As the principal outcomes of the research, the author notes that the determinism of the state's development and its position on the world stage is the basis for the possibility of scientific prediction, but the specific outcome depends not only on general laws, but also on the specific conditions and correct behavior in the situation.

We combine network analysis (based on group co-membership) with LDA topic modeling (based on posts) to identify the ideologies and cultural features which unite and divide virtual Caucasus. The gap between warring nations is bridged by Pan-Caucasian virtual groups with no political ideology.

DE social and intercultural conflicts; multicultural competence;
   intercultural/multicultural communication; interdisciplinary approach;
   mediator
AB Among the most important imperatives of the XXI century globalization (as a process of growing worldwide interconnectedness of structures and cultures) takes one of the first positions. This phenomenon appeared in the XX century and is connected with increasing acceleration in both concrete global interdependence and consciousness of the global whole [9]. It is widely known that various problems and conflicts are associated with globalization (e.g. migration, immigration, employment and education of new arrivals, cultural misunderstanding).
   In this situation researchers from different spheres of social sciences (sociology, education, philosophy, psychology) try to find the ways preventing negative influence of this phenomenon on different sides of our life (M.S. Archer, K.A. Grant, A.Portera, J.Stier, etc.).
   The role of education and educators may be of great significance here. The importance of education is recognized as globally call to the preparation of students to face challenges of migration, mobility, social inequality and etc. In this way it is well known that any education has ideological implementation and foreign language education first of all plays a "political role"[5]. This role is defined as developing an ability to evaluate critically practices and products in one's own and other countries and cultures [4].
   The role of foreign language education integrated with multicultural communication is under our investigation. The globally developing world is becoming multicultural. Consequently, it is not enough to teach students to understand only one contacting culture as in the theory of intercultural communication, which is included in contemporary educational standards. In order to prepare future specialists to communicate and cooperate with different people of the world predicting and preventing social conflicts, it is necessary to create a new approach. Two aspects are significant for us here: 1) the growth of the role of foreign language education as education for citizenship [3], 2) the approvement of the new position of foreign language education as education for global citizenship.
   The purpose of this study was to create, to use in practice and to examine a new approach to the system of foreign language education aimed at developing a new type of competence - multicultural. Multicultural competence is a new perspective in the theory of linguistic education and is based on the cognitive linguistic and focused on the fact that teaching foreign languages is not only a language code acquisition. An important component of teaching is a conceptual world picture of native speakers belonging to different cultures. The idea of the study was to help students understand similarities and differences of cultures and countries being in contact. In general, this competence can help future specialists to become mediators in the situations of cultural and social conflicts.
   One more idea of the research was to develop such characteristic features in the structure of multicultural competence, as tolerance, positive ethnical identity and close social distance with contacting culture.
   he most important parts of our approach were: 1) interdisciplinary and integrating approach which included a theoretical course "Intercultural and multicultural communication" + a practical course "Foreign language (English)"; 2) a field work (practice) in the form of international youth workshop (students from Russia, Italy and Poland working together in real situation of communication and cooperation).
   The results were evaluated in two different ways: 1) analysis of final projects presentations, prepared by international small groups of students; 2) special express questionnaires, helping to collect quantitative data and measure statistical results ("Index of tolerance", "Type of ethnical identity" and "Scale of social distance").

AB An important component of the formation of national identity in Bolivia was the memorial policy created by the official narrative justifying the Creole minority privileged position in government. The War of Independence was the foundational history, it formed an idea of the origins of the nation. Today it remains one of the battlefields of the memory, for the excluded race or social groups, Indians and mestizos. The radical changes in the country at the beginning of the XXI century, led to deny of all past historical heritage, a unified national narrative, offering instead the diversity and multiplicity of narratives, converting the nation in not political and humanistic community with big diversity of elements.

DE quantization of economic data; structural-topological approach; multiple
   global system; planning mechanism; management mechanism
AB More than 100 years ago, the concept of quantization began to go beyond natural and physical sciences. For instance, quantum numbers are used to determine the electron configuration of an atom, the probable location of the atom's electrons and other characteristics of atoms. The main idea of quantization is the application of "double nature" logic to observed processes and phenomena, as well as to their driving forces and structure. Based on this logic, the principle of wave - particle duality was developed in physics and mathematics and provides the basis for quantum mechanics and relativistic theory. This principle applied to analysis and calculations helps to formulate fundamental theories to explain processes and structure using relativistic velocity and, in turn, describe operations of the material world at the macro and micro levels. This article applies the concepts of quantization and representation duality (which is the analysis of the dual nature of facts and events observed at the macro and micro levels) to social, economic and political data to describe the dynamics of actors and processes of the multiple connections of the global system.
   The analysis of the current state of world's multiple connections in a macroeconomic context is conducted within approved parameters that characterize the dynamics of various changes that explain events in a two-dimensional manner. Often criticized by experts, these parameters have been supplemented by new ones, which have not yet resolved the flaws in such a study of changes in economic processes. This article describes a theoretical concept of a structural-topological approach based on presenting global multiple connections in the form of two aggregated spaces - the space of events and the space of states - that complement each other to create a single system. The study demonstrates the representation method of the global economy illustrated through a practical analysis of integrational processes in the European Union and the Eurasian Economic Union. The method presented in this article can be used along with existing research methods to understand global fluctuations.

DE energy consumption of national economy; energy efficiency;
   multidimensional model; development forecasting model.
AB The decrease of energy consumption of national economies and the increase of their energy efficiency is the prior task of development of almost all countries of the world. Different methods and approaches, having shown their rather high efficiency while considering the problem firstly in its sector and regional perspective, are used to solve this problem. In addition to that, a lot of its aspects require to carry out further research. In particular, a lot of unsolved issues refer to the model building of the influence of different factors, influencing greatly the size of energy consumption of national economies in the crisis period of their development. The absence of the developed models suppresses forecasting of the development of social and economic processes in different countries and taking anti-crisis actions. The given research of the dynamics of energy consumption of gross domestic product in different countries based on the analysis of retrospective information for the previous years made it possible to establish the fact that in the crisis conditions the size of energy consumption of national economies changes differently. Thus, for example, the 2008-2009 world financial crisis, which was the last but the most considerable, led to the decrease of the growth rates of the gross domestic product of almost all national economies. The size of the indicator of energy consumption of gross national product in different countries had multidirectional dynamics - it increased in some countries (Latvia, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Russia), but it remained the same in others (Canada, Greece, Germany, Great Britain). These facts presupposed the relevancy of the research, directed at the revelation of factors, greatly influencing the energy consumption of the gross domestic product in different countries of the world in the period of crisis development of their national economies. As the result of the given research, it was stated that the factors, influencing greatly the size of energy consumption, are the following: first, it is the industry share in the gross domestic product of the country; second, it is the service sector share in the gross domestic product of the country; third, it is the share of income, coming from the natural resources sale, in the general size of the gross domestic product of the country. It resulted in building the multidimensional model, which can be further used to forecast the dynamics of the changes in energy consumption of national economies in the crisis conditions of their development and take anti-crisis actions.

DE democracy; government; community; majority; freedom; trust; protest
AB The article discusses the relationship between a government and a protest movement, and takes as its chief example the protest movement of Kiev's Maidan. Analyzing the affective logic of community, which is manifested in a crowd, the author argues that this logic is a necessary component of democracy. The argument implies that what are commonly considered democratic values, such as "freedom" and "justice," are not values, but the effects of the process of resisting any government, the political manifestation of which was described as far back as Hobbes in his description of the state. Having derived the political from these ethical affects, one can produce a nonpolitical definition of democracy in which "freedom," "justice," and "dignity" cease to be tools of political rhetoric, pointing to those community relations that cast doubt on the prevailing understanding of the state and politics.

AB The article deals with the analogue forms of civil society in the Islamic countries of the South. The author analyzes the formation and development of the civil society in this region of the world, its specifics and peculiarities. The author also shows that burgeoning civil society models of non-western area have their own specific features, which are determined by a unique way of civilizational development and by significant impact of the religious factor. The present research brings up a methodological novation - an analogous civil society. According to this novation, the developing political system (which takes part in civilizational competition with other systems and tries to use their historical experience and accumulated resources explicitly, for example, by attracting ideas, technologies, investments, or implicitly - by creating the same resources through modernization and social mobilization) does not imply an organic link between ideologically reflected meaning of this system's existence, the forms of such existence, and the main institutions' functionality. Moreover, this smoothness is not very important and desirable for the analogue system or its components. The meaning of such system's existence is using the forms, principles, mechanisms, elaborated through historical development of social and political systems for their own specific purposes, for the sake of diametrically opposed goals that sometimes are not very detailed.

DE China; modem world; foreign policy; military-political alliance;

AB The article is devoted to the pressing issue of the transformation of China's foreign policy strategies in the world in recent years. The rise of China in the last decades increasingly designates the possibility of China's gaining the status of global superpower and the leading country in the international political arena. China's influence in regional and world affairs is growing rapidly, though 20 years ago its role was hardly noticeable even in East Asia. However, times change and now China, which during the Cold war was considered a backward country of the "Third World", is said to be a new world leader, whose economic potential surpasses that of the United States. At the present stage, China has assumed a heavy burden of responsibility for overcoming the global financial crisis by successfully solving its own problems and helping other countries with substantial financial injections. With the growth of China's influence in the world affairs there is increasing the opposition to its policies on the part of the traditional global and regional opponents, in particular the US and Japan, which coordinate efforts in order to prevent China's advancement to the leading position in the military-political, economic and humanitarian spheres and China's ascent as a new hegemon instead of the United States, the country taking on responsibility for the global development and working out the principles of international relations, the formation of a new architecture of international security and economic and financial stability.

DE Japan-China relations; East Asia; foreign policy; military-political
   alliance; economic integration
AB The article is devoted to the pressing issue of the transformation of China's and Japan's foreign policy strategies in East Asia in recent years. The main feature of these countries' policies in the region is the domination of the economic approaches as the basis for the practical implementation of the "soft power" concept. However, the two countries do not give up the military representative acts, particularly with the use of the navy in order to demonstrate the national military might and readiness to defend their political interests through military means. China's tactic is to switch the consideration of a number of problematic issues with other countries in the region from the multilateral level to the bilateral one. Japan, rapidly losing the position of the centre of the region's economic development, tends in its foreign policy to increasingly rely on the US support and it is modernizing its army at a quick rate, preparing for a military confrontation with China. Japan and the United States are increasingly striving to create the "anti-Chinese coalition" in the Asia-Pacific region with the prospect of its institutional design within the framework of the military-political organization of NATO type. In this regard, China increasingly opposes their policies at all levels, sparing no effort and money to find new allies, such as South Korea, as well as trying to improve its relations with Taiwan. In spite of the political differences, China and Japan increase their economic cooperation and deepen economic interdependence. In the context of enhancing economic cooperation and simultaneous strengthening of the military-political confrontation between China and Japan, the further development of the Sino-Japanese relations is becoming a key issue for the economic and military security of the region.

DE parks of recreation and leisure; upbringing; "a new person"; everyday

AB The paper considers the potestary symbols of a Soviet person's everyday life. The Soviet government did not only work towards a total control of production, but also of private life. The altered leisure concept in the 1920s-1930s helped to create a special type of the so-called "parks of recreation and leisure", which were meant to raise a "new person". The architectural and symbolic design of parks shaped patterns of citizens' behavior, instilling in them new cultural practices that facilitated the tasks of ideological education and formation of a system of total control over society. The author uses materials of the 1920s-1930s, guides of the parks, and archival documents from the Museum of A rchitecture named after A. V. Shchusev. An analysis of architectural projects, the description of landscape design in Moscow and Leningrad, and the impression it produced on its contemporaries allows to draw a conclusion about a special kind of Soviet canon as to the design of parks of recreation and leisure in the 1930s, which later spread throughout the Soviet Union.
   The nature of the events that were held in the parks of recreation and leisure were political and educational rather than recreational.

Archival documents which serve as the main source have been introduced into research circulation for the first time. The author focuses on property crimes and offences against the person: murders, bodily injuries, thefts and robbery. General types of offenders are identified. Also alcoholism, hooliganism, child homelessness, prostitution which were part of daily city life during the NEP time are examined. Finally, some measures of state and public counteraction to prevent criminality growth are shown. It is concluded that social and economic conditions during the NEP increased criminality in the towns of Udmurtia whereas counteraction measures often lacked efficiency and failed to halt the criminality growth.

AB Nowadays the international situation and wide political, social and cultural relations enhance the importance of interpreting from one language into another. The role of professionals in interpreting is also increasing. It causes the necessity of special training and development of interpreters at education institutions of different levels. Training interpreters can be realized from various didactic and methodological standpoints. To find the most effective way of training interpreters the previous practical experience of teaching and theoretical research in the field of interpreters' training methodology should be analyzed.
   The topicality of the paper is explained by not only the increased interest in interpreting as a professional activity but also by a modern view on interpreting as a part of mediation that is considered by European researchers as a special language activity along with reading, speaking, writing and listening. As all language activities can be taught from the point of different lingo didactic approaches, consequently, training interpreting can also be studied as a realization of lingo didactic views and theories known in educational environment.
   The purpose of this paper is to analyze different lingo didactic approaches to teaching foreign languages and their use in training interpreters practice; generalize the ideas of the previous studies and suggest the ways how to implement these theories into the modern practice of teaching and training interpreters-to-be more effectively; concentrate on the issues of training interpreters in a specific setting; present some examples from the practice of teaching and training interpreters at Peoples' Friendship University of Russia (RUDN University).

AB The article introduces into forms of political and social representation specific to the recent Russian civil protests. The analysis is based on numerous interviews with protesters and observation of evolution of the movement. The data challenges the frequently referenced "crisis" of representation and bring to light a variety of coordination centers set in competition for a political mandate of the protest movement, as far as a vague will of a considerable part of protesters to be represented. Media coverage of the street rallies, including their global attribution to a "middle class," is critically examined along with the protesters' own statements and rallies agenda, in order to check the presence of an actual social or revolutionary representation. The article reveals a break with apparatus and hegemonic models of collective action in current mobilization which provides it with new (in the Russian context) forms of political subjectivity based on self-empowerment and self-trial.

AB The background of national economy innovation development is modernization and expansion of scientific-research complex enterprises. Considerable losses in material and technical basis on the majority of science intensive manufactures are demanding a multiply investments increase to their rejuvenation according to modern technological standards requirements. Reduction of centralized assignment per financing research-and-development activities (R&DA) in absolute and relative expression (from more than 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1989 to approximately 1% in 2015) has weakened Russia positions in global market and considerably undermined fundamentals of national economy industrial and research fields conversion to the qualitatively new level generated during several decades. Increase of science intensive and modern in technical plan industries percent in gross national product (GNP) will provide Russian commodity market an edge on developing countries, undervalued export net cost of which is stipulated by extremely low expenditures level on the labor application. The main problem is not only in search of possible financial resources sources, but also in preplanning a science intensive enterprises development program, corresponding with current priorities of the industrial policy.

DE BSEC; Russia; science; education; potential collaboration; bibliometric
   analysis
AB Regional international organizations have a significant impact on the global economy by fostering bilateral and multilateral collaboration and cooperation in a wide range of areas. The Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) serves as a forum for cooperation of 12 Member States in about 20 different areas, including information and communication technologies, exchange of statistical data and economic information, healthcare, environmental protection, education, science and technology, and aims to encourage multilateral relations and foster economic development in the Black Sea region. This study contains an analysis of the current state, dynamics and prospects of international cooperation of the BSEC Member States with the Russian Federation in the field of research, science and education. The main objectives of the development of international cooperation in these areas include implementation of joint Research & Development projects and programs for greater valorization of the educational potential, geared towards increased students' mobility rates and cooperation among universities and research-focused institutions in the BSEC Member States. Addressing these objectives will allow to increase the efficiency of the exchange of the best practices in the field of research, science and education, as well as expand the application of innovative technologies in these areas of cooperation. The key method of the study is a bibliometric analysis of Scopus indexed scientific publications of universities and research-focused institutions in the BSEC Member States in a wide range of subject areas over a period 2010-2016. The article provides an overview of the current state and dynamics of cooperation of the BSEC Member States and the analysis of the promising areas of collaboration in the field of research, science and education. The article concludes that overcoming the barriers to multilateral and bilateral cooperation and strengthening collaboration of the BSEC Member States in the promising areas of research will improve the level of internationalization of universities and research-focused institutions in the BSEC Member States, enhance the quality of education and improve research and economic cooperation.

DT Article
AB In this article, Oleg Budnitskii introduces the publication of correspondence between Vasily Maklakov and Oskar (Israel) Gruzenberg spanning the period of one year: January 1933 to January 1934. In Late Imperial Russia, they were known as leading lawyers and public figures, who conversed on ethical problems with Leo Tolstoy and led the liberal opposition to the regime. Occasionally, their professional paths crossed, for example, during the infamous Beilis trial (1913), when Maklakov and Gruzenberg led the defense team. At the same time, they were divided on many political issues, as well as by personal attitudes. The rise of the Nazis to power in Germany provoked Maklakov and Gruzenberg, now living in emigration in France, to discuss the new political reality in Europe: that of dictatorships based on massive nationalist mobilization. They discuss the prospects of the Soviet regime in this new reality, which leads them to a bigger question of the "nature" of the Russian people, the historical roots of the Bolshevik Revolution, and their own integrity in politics and as professionals.

DE protection of civil rights; privacy of citizen; problems
AB This work contains a legal description of the new concept for Russian civil law - the protection of the private life of a citizen. New law of the Civil Code is considered by the author in the system of intangible objects such as a private life, right for presentment, family life, privacy, secrecy of correspondence, documents and etc.
   Based on the method of materialist dialectics which is widely used in the science of civil law, the author explored the concept of private life of a citizen in the context of the historical situation, exploring the patterns and trends of it as a social phenomenon, for the first time regulated by the norms of the Civil Code. In addition, using comparative law method, the author studied the experience of legal regulation of the protection of private life of an individual in foreign legal systems.
   Carried out the systematic analysis of the norms of civil law in this area the author formulates some problems of theory and practice suggesting ways to resolve them.
   One of the contentious issues of law enforcement is the use information on the private life of a citizen to create works of science, literature and art. Privacy protection regime is used ambiguously within the civil justice. Specially, it stipulates the obligation of the parties to keep in secret private information about the life of a citizen which has become known to them in the event and (or) the performance of the obligations which also causes many debates and judgments.
   The main disadvantage of Art. 152.2 of the Civil Code is the lack of certain effects and sanctions which could occur in case of violation of the right to privacy. The article has a link to the general methods of protection of civil rights which do not allow to fully restore the right.
   Comprehensive implementation of the proposed sanctions taking into account the experience of foreign countries, the development of a common approach to interpretation of the rules on the protection of private life of a citizen in law enforcement will allow to restore the non-property rights of a citizen in full.

   Volokolamsk; Russia and Europe; Renaissance; political theology;
   autocracy; freedom; humanism
AB The aim of the present paper is to provide a historical and philosophical analysis and an up-to-date interpretation of the correspondence between Andrei Kurbsky and Ivan the Terrible. According to the author, the decisive point of disagreement between the two was a difference not just of political and ideological, but also of cultural and aesthetic priorities: Prince Kurbsky's commitment to the Renaissance humanism (his acquaintance with it began long before his departure from Russia) did not allow him to adopt the program of cultural isolation and political authoritarianism implemented by the Tsar. Whereas the latter used the religious idea with the aim get Russia turn against Europe and to suppress freedom aspirations inside Russia, Kurbsky, with his keen interest in European scientific methods and fascinated by the diversity of religious and philosophical ideas in the West, opted for the dialogic model of social interaction and championed cultural rapprochement between Russia and Europe. It would be fair to say that Prince Kurbsky was one of the first Russian Europeans. Hence the interpretation proposed by the author, according to which the correspondence between Andrei Kurbsky and Ivan the Terrible can be regarded as a manifestation of the dramatic collision between divergent vectors of Russian political thought, the opposing versions of Russian spirituality and Russian mission. These ideological extremities, first crystallized in the famous epistolary duel of 17th century, kept being reproduced at almost every stage in the history of Russian society as a constant and integral part of its identity, a problem of an indubitably existential nature. Controversy between Ivan the Terrible and Andrei Kurbsky in many ways provided the model of historiosophical thinking and shaped the format of political debate in Russia.

DE retirement age; population ageing; demographic forecast; pension system

AB Population ageing has been one of the main driving forces behind pension policies and reforms in the past two decades. Increase of the retirement age looks the most obvious and easy response to population ageing. The article evaluates the possibility of increasing the retirement age to mitigate the influence of ageing on the pension system of Russia. The study consisting of building forecasts of the gender and age structure of the population has been performed. The following assumption has been made to study the effects of increasing the retirement age to 65 years for all categories of the Russian citizens. Increase of the retirement age will start in 2016, run at a pace of 6 months per year, and end in 2026 for men and in 2036, for women. The forecast confirmed a well-known paradox that-if the situation with the reduction of mortality rate continues to improve as it used to in the recent years the ageing pace negatively affecting the pension system balance will turn out to be even faster at least in the mid-term prospect.

AB "Dangerous liaisons" of the left and right-conservative discourse have been discussed widely by different thinkers of the 20th century. Most sharply this issue rung in the context of long standing debates between the left esoteric Walter Benjamin and the conservative utopist Carl Schmitt. Based on the texts of Benjamin and Schmitt of the 20s and 30s focused on a range of issues such as sovereignty, state of emergency or violence and language, the author exposes the irreducibility of the positions of these two thinkers and their fundamental political, metaphysical and ethical alternativeness. The article critically analyses the approaches of famous modern day researchers to the theme referred to (Agamben), conditioned by their preconceived political, theological and metaphysical convictions.

AB This essay reviews the works of a world-known political studies researcher, Inoguchi Takashi, on current Japanese politics and political science. Although political science emerged in the 20th century, its origin, according to Inoguchi, can be found in ancient philosophy conceptions of Greece, Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, or China. The key point emphasized by Inoguchi, is the deep distinction between Abrahamic and Dharmic traditions. The former can be associated with Christianity, Islam, and Judaism and focuses on standardization and unification, whereas the latter is associated with Buddhism, Hinduism, Daoism and Shintoism and focuses on embracing diversity and respecting differences. Hence appears Inoguchi's central conclusion: "Neither Western political science, nor non-Western political science exists; there is political science of embracing and equilibrating two traditions - Abrahamic and Dharmic.

AB This article describes the research aimed at studying possibilities of efficient automated analysis of public opinion on activity of public authorities in open mass and social media for purposes of political science. The task was divided into the following subtasks: 1) to configure the monitoring system to collect online publications of mass media and other open data sources; 2) to make an ontological representation of public authorities, their activities, and possible evaluations; 3) to develop the computer system for linguistic expertise of texts on the basis of this ontology; 4) to develop computer analysis tools to identify evaluative judgments about activities of public authorities on the basis of this expertise.
   The problem still remains, that opinions are often communicated by means of metaphors, allusions, hints, circumlocutions, etc. In this article, the perspectives of further studies are discussed: improving the ontology in the domain of public administration and federal governmental agencies, and the opinion mining tool to analyze the abovementioned means of indirect evaluation.

DE globalization; contemporary world; humankind; interdependence;

AB The author addresses globalization from the philosophical viewpoint and considers multiple visions of globalization in different cultures. The 21st century turned a new page in history, because the world became global and interconnected in accordance with the basic parameters of social life. These transformations are results of the historical development of society, which entered the era of global relations during the great geographic discoveries when economic, political, and cultural contacts irreversibly transcended the borders of separate countries. Globalization's development provoked new global power configurations and a new vision of world events and was a primary cause in the destruction of the world socialist system. The world did not become more secure, because humans continue with habitual, but obsolete, categories. Separate states confront each other and struggle in pursuit of their interests. The author envisions an alternative through developing civil society, democratic principles, and human rights, taking into consideration regional peculiarities and the mentality of peoples living in each region. Every nation, while preserving its traditions and values, is obliged, for the sake of guaranteeing the future to pursue universal interests first and to follow the motto "think globally, act jointly."

AB The aims of this study are to trace a path of a marginal to the elite and to identify factors of social ascent in a particular case of David Rosenberg (1879-1950). The goals can be achieved by studying representative sources - a compendium of personal and office documents, journalistic, educational and scientific literature. Social discrimination against the Jews in the Russian Empire pushed the Jewish youth to political radicalism. Like many others, Rosenberg could not get an education and a prestigious profession. In 1904 he joined the Bund, led the anti-government agitation among workers and in 1914 he was exiled to Siberia. In the years of the Revolution and the Civil War Rosenberg was a Menshevik, the party publicist and editor of political newspapers in Tomsk. In 1920 Rosenberg changed political orientation and joined RCP(b), the Russian Communist Party of the Bolsheviks. He was in the personnel reserve of the Siberian Bureau of the RCP(b). However as a former Menshevik he could not make a political career. During the New Economic Policy (NEP) Rosenberg-communist had a wide range of other possibilities. The transformation of educational system, an acute shortage of staff allowed him, a dropout in the "past life", to begin scientific and teaching career. In the 1920s Rosenberg taught political economy, he became a communist professor and wrote "A commentary on Marx's `Capital'". It successfully fit into the political situation and helped with a widespread introduction of Marxism into higher education and science. In the 1930s Rosenberg continued successful scientific and teaching career at institutes and universities in Moscow. As a very valuable specialist who strengthened ideological foundations of the regime he escaped the Great Terror. In 1939 Rosenberg was awarded the title of Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1945-1948 he worked as a senior researcher at the Marx-Engels-Lenin (MEL) Institute of the Central Committee of the ACP(b), All-Union Communist Party of the Bolsheviks. An underlined dedication to the Communist Party, the choice of specific profession of "political propagandist in science" and extraordinary abilities were key to Rosenberg's survival and successful career in the Soviet society. However, because of the formation of a new ideological paradigm based on antisemitism in the Soviet Union in 1948-1953 Rosenberg was unable to publish his new book and lost his job at the MEL Institute. In 1950 the seventy-year-old expert on Marxism- Leninism could not bear a new round of struggle for survival and social status. The author of the article concluded, that a successful individual mobility during the revolutionary age is of particular interest. It highlights an emergence of the higher levels of the new social hierarchy on the ruins of the old society. During wars, revolutions and radical transformations in Russia in the first half of the XX century this process was extremely controversial and rapid.

AB The article is devoted to the evolution of political views of Louis Stanislas Xavier of the House of Bourbon, who until his accession to the throne of France in 1795 as Louis XVIII held the title of Count of Provence. At the beginning of the French Revolution he advocated reforms and was very popular, then he went into exile in 1791 and took a more conservative stance, but the course of events forced him by 1799 to realise the need for compromise between the Ancien Rtigime and the Revolution. The author demonstrates that Louis XVIII acted more as a politician rather than as a prince while expressing the ideas he believed were the most effective. At the same time, Louis XVIII did not betray his own political views as he always knew very well the extent to which he was willing to make concessions.

The study is focused on geospatial identification, socio-economic parameterization and structuring of the coastal zone of Russia. The detailed characteristics of its most important segments the Baltic and the Black Sea-Azov coastal zones, are given. The main factors of formation of the long-term, permanent and tactical (i.e. associated with the crisis processes and changes in the geopolitical and geo-economic situation) cross-border clusters in the coastal areas of Russia are analyzed. An inventory of the most important cross-border clusters, localized in the Kaliningrad, Leningrad, Rostov and Krasnodar regions is carried out. Their impact on the regional economy and the dynamics of the settlement system is evaluated.

DE small and medium-sized enterprises; innovation potential
AB The aim of this article is to analyze the relationship of innovation potential and its main components with the level of small and medium-sized enterprises development in Russian regions. Based on international and Russian experience the regional innovation potential was evaluated using the multilevel approach. It includes the calculation of the partial sub indices reflecting the innovation potential components in the regions (resources, infrastructure and effectiveness of innovation) as well as the composite index evaluation based on them. Principal components analysis of the variables characterizing small and medium-sized enterprises density in a region and these enterprises contribution to regional employment allows obtaining generalized characteristic of the level of small and medium-sized enterprises development. By the values of resource and effectiveness components of the innovation potential the typological groups of Russian regions were highlighted. The analysis reveals a significant moderate positive relationship between the level of small and medium-sized enterprises development (in particular, the groups of micro and small enterprises, medium-sized enterprises) and the composite index of innovative potential as well as sub-indices characterizing its components. For mediumsized enterprises this relationship with the resource and effectiveness components is higher because medium-sized enterprises are more involved in innovation activities. Currently, the contribution of small enterprises to innovative development of Russian regions is negligible, so the level of small entrepreneurship development depends mostly on regional infrastructure than on other aspects of innovation. Finally, practical recommendations were developed to stimulate entrepreneurial activity taking into account regional specificities.

A young Italian state serves as an example of the existing problem: an insufficient promotion of the Italian language together with the historically formed regionalism, and a wide spread of dialects can become a reason for political instability and for a weakness of a state unity.

TI "EUROPEANIZATION", "WESTERNIZATION" AND MECHANISMS OF ADAPTATION OF
   WESTERN INNOVATIONS IN IMPERIAL RUSSIA
SO VOPROSY ISTORII
LA Russian
DT Article
DE europeanization; westernization; Russia; innovations; adaptation of
   innovations; diffusion waves; elites; "phenomenon of Bashmachkin"
AB The article proposes the new interpretation of the problem of European cultural influence on Russia of the imperial period. By developing the cultural-civilizational approach offered by Polish sociologist P. Sztompka for analysis of transition state in postcommunist societies, the authors consider the use of this approach possible for comprehension of transit states of other historical epochs, in particular, for interpretation of historical transition from the Middle Ages to Modern period. Proceeding from this, Russia is presented 'as a country, which always belonged to European cultural circle, but entered into the civili7ational dissonance with the number of West European countries, which earlier than others accomplished the "modern leap". Due to the number of reasons (not least of a political nature) in the XV XVI centuries the two interrelated stereotypes were formed in the intellectual discourse of the Western countries: about the unified European identity and non -European character of Russia. These stereotypes, due to circumstances, were accepted by Russian political elite of Petrine era, that, in its turn, created a new myth about the "tsar-demiurge", who led barbaric Russia to the bosom of civilized European powers. In practice, according to authors' opinion, the content of the process of including Russia to the sphere of "civilized" European countries was determined by its transformation from traditional, medieval European country to the European power of Modem Age. In this regard, the term "Europeanization" has no real basis in relation to Russia, because this question is not about including of non -European country to the European cultural space, but only about modernization of one of the countries of European periphery. Through the prism the article considers "the process of perception of western novelties, which, contrary to established terminology, by no means always may be defined as "European innovations". The authors propose their own scheme of mechanism of novelties' turning to innovations, note the multistage character of such transformations (diffusion waves) and pay attention to the special role of hierarchically organized elite groups mediators, translators and actors of innovations, in this process.

TI SEARCH FOR THE NEW IDEAS OF RUSSIAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FROM THE
   PERSPECTIVE OF THE THEORY OF PASSIONARITY
SO TERRA ECONOMICUS

DT Article
DE new idea; passionarity; economic methodology; development; etnos
AB Moscow Economic Forum (MEF-2016, end of March, 2016) had discussion on the intriguing theme of search for new ideas of development of the Russian economy, with the national idea as the main focus. Such orientation of scientific search makes it reasonable to turn to cognitive potential of Lev Gumilev's theory of passionarity. Its potential is being developed in many directions of modern social science.
   Application of method of the theory of passionarity shows its relevance for the Russian economic science, in particular, for the process of collective search for new ideas which could help to renovate the archaic structure of Russian economy. The author justifies legitimacy, relevance and necessity of application of methodological tools of the theory of passionarity for the analysis of creative potential of the Russian ethnos at the current life cycle phase. Application of these tools can provide efficiency of search for the new ideas of Russian economic development, and result in a denial of various cliches which may mislead the scientific search. At the same time, today such application is limited because of the methodological abilities of research participants, due to decline in political-economy level of analytical culture.
   Special attention is paid by the author to the interdisciplinary character of search for the new ideas of Russian economic development, with the emphasis on complex approach, involving: context analysis, detailed historical description of the economic system, clearness of the research in terms of its object, conceptual integrity, effective combining of strengths of different scientific approaches, as well as assessment of feasibility of the new developmental ideas. The author seeks the real assessment of potential of development that the Russian ethnos possesses at the inertia phase of its life cycle.

AB This article is the result of the author's reflection on I. Pantin's book "Russian Revolution. idea, Ideology, Political Practice." Author of the paper suggests to analyze I. Pantin's research and sources of Russian revolution. The essential problem is studied by politico-philosophic approach to social phenomena. The review comprises three parts. In part one Gramsci's approach to ideology studies is examined. The second section deals with reconstructions of the history of Russian Revolution. The last part of review covers problems of the history of social struggles and the genesis of revolutionary party in Russia. Pantin shows that Russian revolution evolved faster than previous explorers suggested. He wrote about tree phases of revolution: 1) preproletarian phase - Narochilk movement, peasant's democracy and proproletariat's intellectuals; 2) Narodnaya Volya struggle with the state; 3) Social-Democracy and organized movement of working class. In the article author writes about Pantin's main ideas on the process of creating the ideology of revolutionary party, on the causes of political split and the ways of growing the power of revolution. Author gives his opinion about the activities of the government, which brought the revolution nearer. Author tries to prove that Pantin offers the original concept of Russian revolution, which is actual to the future, not to the past. The book revives the ideology in political studies. The main Pantin's method is that ideology of political position helps to be linked in the process, to become the part of historical movement, to see the historical perspective from inside.

DT Article
DE autonomization; decentralization; devolution; social policy; European

AB Introduction: the article is devoted to the autonomization process (gaining of ethnical and territorial autonomy) in modern Europe and relevance of the social component in this process. Purpose: to analyze the significance of the social component, considered under this study as vesting autonomies with power to carry out social policy and providing them with the relevant financial opportunities in the course of decentralization and devolution. Methods: the methodological framework of the research is based on a set of methods, including universal, general scientific methods and also comparative law and technical methods. Results: various models of autonomization in Europe show various strategies of regional and/or ethnical elites. The models considered in the article are characterized with the elites' focus on gaining a high degree of autonomy and its legitimation (decentralization without breakup of the state, devolution without revolution). Though political ambitions, ethnical and regional identity play their significant part, socio-economic factors, in general, and the autonomization social component, in particular, determine this process to a considerable extent. The European models of autonomization do not exemplify political ambitions being satisfied at the expense of social policy curtailing.

DT Article
DE foreign campaign of the Russian army in 1813-1814; Patriotic War of
   1812; the Napoleonic wars; historiography of the war of 1812; era of
   1812
AB The subject of historiography on the foreign campaign of the Russian army of 1813-1814 was traditionally eclipsed by the heroic events of the previous year. The Russian historical science shows more interest in the historiographical research on the problems of the war of 1812. Works analyzing the campaign of 1813-1814 are few in number. The foreign campaign of 1813-1814 led to large changes in the European world order. For decades Russia became one of the leading European powers. The Napoleonic wars gave rise to many kinds of legends, served as the basis for the formation of the key Russian historical myths. Being closely related to historiography, historical myths began to form the state historical policy. Today, topics associated with the foreign campaign of the Russian army in 1813-1814, because of their importance for the Russian history, are relevant. In this regard, it is necessary to trace how the domestic historical science covered the event and what aspects of the 1813-1814 campaign receive more attention. The first time researchers addressed the historiography on the foreign campaign of the Russian army of 1813-1814 was during the celebration of the centennial of the Patriotic War. The monograph of S. Kartsov and K. Voensky Prichiny voyny 1812 goda [Causes of the War of 1812] and the article by V. Alexeyev "Otechestvennaya voyna v russkoy istoricheskoy literature" [Patriotic War in Russian Historical Literature] were first attempts of periodization and analysis of the historiography of the 19th century. During the Soviet period of the Russian historical science, there was no summary research on the foreign campaign of 1813-1814. The development of historiography of the 1812 era was influence by the political situation. During a long period, the work of historians was focused on the creation of a negative image of the enemy. They saw a prevailing reactionary significance in the foreign campaign. Moreover, the participation and the role of Alexander I were reduced to a minimum. The Russian army and the talented commanders won the war. Special attention was given to Kutuzov. However, researchers turned to the historiographical issues of the foreign campaign of 18131814 in the context of the history of the War of 1812 and foreign policy of Russia at the beginning of the 19th century. The works of L. Beskrovny, N. Troitsky, B. Abalikhin and V. Dunaevsky are representative in this respect. At the present stage, Russian historians turned to the experience of historiography of the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as to the western historiographical tradition of studying the Napoleonic wars. The authors of a number of papers, not specifically devoted to the historiographical issues, feel the need to pay attention to the historiography of certain moments and aspects of the era of 1812. For the first time there began a discussion on the Napoleonic wars in regular scientific conferences devoted to the era of 1812. Despite the availability of a sufficient number of works, there is no coherent work on the historiography of the foreign campaign of the Russian army of 1813-1814.

SE Value Inquiry Book Series

DT Article; Book Chapter
DE Yeltsin's Russia; former Soviet Union; internal anarchy; anarchy in
   international relations; security; the West
AB This essay addresses extremely up to date issues, because the anarchist trends today have become widespread in the world, including Western countries. Between the end of the 1990s and until fairly recently, very little has been published on anarchism in the West. In recent years, however, many new books have been published as anarchist tendencies have begun to develop extensively in different places around the world. The author analyzes the role anarchism played in the Russian post-communist experience of the late 20th century. This essay demonstrates the importance of anarchist tendencies after the collapse of the Soviet Union and puts them into the context of pre-political and post-political forms of consciousness that ignore the role of the state in maintaining social order. The author argues that Western scholarship and politicians confused anarchic with democratic tendencies in Russia and encouraged anarchist Russian development. In contrast to the opinion that Russia pursued the democratic path, which prevailed in 1990s in Western countries, the internal anarchy of Yeltsin's Russia stopped institutionalization of democracy in the country and, at the same time, played an important role in increasing international anarchy.

DT Article
DE ideal citizen's model; liberal education; indoctrination; R.W.
   Livingstone; K. Mannheim; The Council for Curriculum Reform
AB After the Great War it seemed that the democratic idea would have triumphed in Europe forever. But by 1939 the liberal-democratic regimes had survived only in 13 out of 29 countries. Britain was one of those countries. In spite of this, not without the influence of the experience of totalitarian states, in the 1930s, for the first time in British history, the issue of the need for social and political propaganda among the population (especially among youth) was raised. It was the issue of the conveyance of a well-defined "political philosophy". But due to the fact that "propaganda" and "indoctrination" presented a frightening sense, the British preferred to talk about civic or liberal education. The search for the ideal of the citizen-democrat, corresponding with the terms of the twentieth century, became part of the discussion that took place at different levels of the public and state structures. An understanding of "citizenship", formulated by Professor Richard Winn Livingston, came into widespread acceptance: a "good citizen" is like a "good soldier"; he serves as part of the body, and, if necessary, sacrifices his life and carries out his duties to the state on his own free will. Truly, in the "era of totalitarianism" most people preferred to talk about person's duties not to the state but to the fellow citizens, to society. Another image of the citizen-democrat's ideal was introduced by the Council for the Curriculum Reform which treated the democratic way of life as a combination of the Roman feeling for law, the Christian love and brotherhood, the medieval respect for reason, the seventeenth-century pursuit of empiricism and science, and, not the least, the passion for the social justice and social equality which inspired the reformers of the 18th and 19th centuries. In the time of crisis there was a desire to convince people that they were to blame themselves, and therefore they should engage in self-improvement. A well-known European thinker Karl Mannheim, who emigrated from Germany to England in 1933, opposed the reanimation of the liberal theory and its postulates, according to which the purpose of education is a free development of internal qualities of a free person. The sociologist believed that it is impossible to be a good Christian in a society in which the basic laws contradict the spirit of Christianity. Therefore he defended the process of social changes and those virtues and values that can provide it: brotherly love, mutual assistance, honesty, social justice, freedom and respect for the individual. At the same time, in order to survive, democracy must become "militant", and therefore it must produce individuals who are advanced and militant, but not fanatical. The search for the ideal of the citizen and ways for his training, widely spread in British society on the eve of war, eased the preservation of social stability that was so needed in the UK during its more than five-year fight against the Nazi Germany.

LA English
DT Article
DE art; culture; avant-garde; leadership; rock music; the left; the USSR;

AB The article reveals the similarities in development of Soviet art in post-Revolutionary years and in the period of "defrosting" and "stagnation". It was accepted, that this comparison is appropriate due to presence of similar aspects in the Soviet political system of the abovementioned chronological periods. The author demonstrates a great role of avant-garde art in the cultural life of the country in 1920-1930 and at the turn of 1950-1960. The specific character of Russian avant-garde, as the "Revolutionary" art, was revealed. It substantiated the idea about possible approval of the Soviet leadership in the sphere of "new" art (including rock-music) in the whole world in post-Stalin period due to competitive advantages, as compared to the USA and Great Britain. There were important factors-given the specificity of Soviet cultural policy that prevented the USSR from becoming the global leader in the sphere of new art. The negative aspects of Soviet socialist realism were denoted, even though partially, especially in advancement of the USSR's positive image in the world. The conclusion is that there needs to be certain amount of freedom under the cultural policy of the state as a required condition for participation in cultural sphere.

DT Article
DE integration; Andrey Baykov; convergence; regionalization; regionalism;
   comparative analysis
AB The author of the article considers the study of the integration problems in Russian political science. In early 21st century, integration has turned into a global trend: having acquired the status of a significant tendency, since the middle of the 20th century (marked by the success of, first, economic, and, then, political and managerial consolidation in Europe), this process has subsequently embraced different regions of the world. The strengthening of integration that started in some regions (overseas Europe, Asia, the Americas, and others) and in some periods, occurred almost simultaneously with the processes of decay in other regions (the USSR). A significant expansion of the area of integration at the beginning of the 21st century has emphasized the urgent need for understanding of this phenomenon, and it's really happening; so far abundant and diverse literature has appeared. A characteristic feature of this literature is that until early 21st century, the study focused mostly on European experience, which is often seen by default as a normative model. Awareness of the limits of this approach has stimulated the desire to move beyond the borders of the EU experience. In Russian literature, this direction has been actively and successfully developed by A. Baykov, whose works mark the promotion of the general theory of integration.

AB From the 1980s, the concept of the new world order for a long time remained almost synonymous with the ideas of Western domination. However, because of globalization we see that today the new world order is being established on some other and more fair principles because the United States and the West continue to gradually weaken. With regard to the decline of u.s. leadership and the rise of the developing countries we expect that no country can substitute for the United States as the hegemonic power. Thus, the World System will continue its development in the future without an absolute leader. So, in the next decades the global political landscape will undergo dramatic changes. We are at the outset of a very complex, contradictory, and long process of creating a new world order. The directions, forms, and results of the processes of its transformations to a great extent depend on the changing balance of world forces and on different geopolitical factors and combinations. Philosophy faces many problems with respect to the creation of a new world order. Without doubt philosophers can do much to make better and more humane the world order that is being created.

DE drug market; psychoactive substances; legal psychoactive substances;
   pricing factor; new potentially harmful substances
AB The pricing of substances on the drug market plays a particular role in influencing the behavior of its participants. The primary tendencies in the development of the drug market are driven by the interest of drug dealers in receiving an excess profit. The manipulation of retail prices permits the organizers of the narcotics market to effect an orientation of price sensitive consumers towards new and potentially more harmful substances. At the same time, in order to increase the maximum net profit, they have been able to improve their established channels for the sale of drugs. In this connection, the question concerning the evaluation of the influence of the price factor on changes in volumes and the variety of available psychoactive substances becomes increasingly relevant. The influence of the retail price, total profit and profitability of criminal businesses on the turnover of phytogenetic cannabinoids, opiates, some synthetic drugs defined in terms of psychostimulators and "smoking mixes" -and also legal substances- is assessed on data pertaining to the Russian Federation.
   A conclusion is drawn concerning the dominant influence of organizers of the illegal drug market on changes in its diverse makeup by means of price factors used to direct the consumer to a choice of less expensive synthetic substances, which are conditionally categorized as detailed above. Effective measures to reduce the currently legal narcotics market segment should consist of a ban on the circulation of new, potentially harmful substances and, in order to slow the growth in the number of consumers, to lower the definition of a significant amount of a psychoactive substance for the purposes of Articles 228, 228.1, 229 and 229.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation to the size of the nominal consumable single dose. For a major decline in demand for psychoactive drugs it is necessary to continue work on the creation of a national system for the rehabilitation and resocialization of drug users.

DE academic potential; highly qualified specialists; academic staff drain;
   brain drain; exchange and mobility; highly skilled migration
AB This paper investigates challenges currently faced by academic staff in Russia. Along with the terminology analysis, the paper draws a distinction between such research concepts as: highly qualified specialists; academic staff drain; "brain drain"; intellectual exchange, circulation and mobility; academic elite. Based on a comprehensive analysis of studies dealing with various aspects of highly skilled migration and academic mobility, available research resources for deepening the understanding of these concepts worldwide are analysed. Statistical data characterising trends in the reproduction of Russian scientific potential over the 1990-2014 period is analysed. It is shown that, although the science and engineering fields in Russia declined by one fifth during this period, the academic staff suffered a loss of nearly two thirds. Over the 1990-1998 period, the number of researchers decreased by 58 per cent. The academic staff outflow in other economic sectors amounted to 500,000 people, with the Russian academic diaspora abroad accounting for 30,000 people. Some key reasons for the abovementioned process are given. Challenges affecting the reproduction of academic potential in Russia are described in terms of the significantly reduced number of researchers, staff aging and ineffective staff structure. Collaboration with Russian expatriate researchers currently residing abroad is suggested as a means of restoring academic potential in Russia.

DE sustainable development; region; state economy; subordinate and general
   systems; economic crisis
AB Sustainable development of regions has always been a prime concern of any state. Therefore, the development of instruments capable of providing an adequate assessment of sustainability in regional social and economic systems is a relevant task for economists. The purpose of this work was to design an algorithm for determination of the level of sustainability and possible reactions of the economic system in a given region ("subordinate" system) to changes occurring in the economy of a country ("general" system). The proposed methodology is based on the analysis of time-series macroeconomic indicators developed by correlating the rates of their growth. A classification characterizing types of possible reactions of the subordinate system to changes in the economic situation within the general system is given. On the basis of the algorithm proposed for the analysis of regional sustainability, we developed a software product, which may facilitate estimation and classification of sustainability in Russian regions. Maps of Russia are provided to illustrate the sustainability classes of Russian regions calculated based on the index of industrial production. These maps allow the response of Russian regional industries to the crisis of 2008-2009 and macroeconomic instability of 2014 to be assessed.

DE Globalization; new media environment; professional values; university
   students; psychological mechanisms
AB In the present-day globalized world new media with their distinctive features have brought human society to a highly interconnected and complex level, penetrating and dissolving human boundaries and influencing the way we live, think and behave. The cyberspace formed by the new media allows people to generate virtual experience and reality. Moreover, it effectuates the free alteration of one's gender, appearance, ideology, occupation, personal and professional needs and values ([1]).
   Our research focuses on the discussion of the relationship between the new media environment and university students' perception of their professional values in the modern conditions of globalization.
   In fact, the globalization of young individuals' culture, ideology and lifestyle has become a conceptual magnet attracting research and theorizing efforts from a variety of disciplines and interdisciplinary formations such as psychology, political science, cultural, communication and media studies, cognitive linguistics, journalism and sociology.
   Multiple studies as well as our own findings show that many young people today see the meaning of life in interesting work, in their welfare, in the humanization of social relations and in building a truly democratic state, whose activities would be aimed at creating conditions for the harmonious development of a man ([2]). The formation of new media community that crosses all the boundaries of human society definitely challenges the way young individuals perceive their common life principles and professional values. And this community is also able to affect young people's professional consciousness and its key psychological mechanisms - goal-setting, professional reflection and professional self-concept - as it is stated in this paper below.

AB The article raises the question of the role of foreign trips of Russian Slavophiles in the development of their social and political views. The author considers Slavophilism as a form of Russian liberalism, as they were opposed to serfdom, fought for openness and the power of public opinion, put forward the idea of Zemsky Sobor (The Assembly of the land) a kind of Russian parliament, called for individual freedom and for the development of entrepreneurship. The reason for the development of their concept of distinctive Russian way was not the absence of knowledge about Western Europe, but the good knowledge of it. The article examines in detail the notes of about two dozen Slavophiles and their supporters, which were made while traveling through foreign countries of Europe. These notes show peculiar political liberalism of Slavophiles, especially of A. I. Koshelev, A. S. Khomyakov, Kireevskys brothers and others. Nevertheless, the Slavophiles advocated the idea of a special Russian way, and called for Slavic reciprocity, spirituality and soulfulness.

The fact is substantiated that the seizure of their jurisdiction of cases on state crimes is a reflection of the specificity of the political regime, the legal policy of the Russian state, justice, legal culture and mentality of the Russian society of the second half of the XIXth century.

AB In the present article based on rare archival materials for the first time used in scientific circulation the author examines the issues of cultural and domestic arrangement of migrant kolkhozes (collective farms) in the North Caucasus region in the period of agriculture collectivization. The author highlights the key activities of regional authorities in the sphere of cultural development within these collective farms. It is stated that cultural arrangement of resettlement of collective farms in the 1930s was far from ideal. But taking into account state importance of the resettlement campaign, the authorities managed to achieve certain positive changes. An integral part of the cultural life of the people of the red army was its political and ideological component, due to the high level of politicization of public life in the USSR in 1930s. The red army collective farms were equipped with schools, nurseries and kindergartens, clubs and cinemas but these institutions were poorly organized. The article points out that labour of the red army settlers had little common features with farms of the local people. Community production activities and everyday leisure are, on the contrary, marked by the similarity of lifestyle. The mass spread of literacy stimulated the reader's interest - immigrants in their leisure hours read the newspapers, magazines and books, mainly fiction. The author examines the everyday life of immigrants, and it is largely substantiated by their social moods which contributed to the formation of the red army collective farms. The author came to the conclusion that the daily life of settlers was largely due to their social disadvantage. Food and accommodation, working conditions were at a very low level. For most of them, life and work in the Kuban Cossack villages was a daily test of their physical and moral forces and was not much different from the life of the Kuban collective farmers.

DT Article
DE intervention; conflict; instability; indicators
AB The starting point of the conclusions of politicians and experts was the recognition of the changed nature of threats to the New World Order. In post-Westfalia system of international relations the main actors are not sovereigns, but transnational actors of world politics, including transnational terrorist and criminal networks. In this situation, the support of global security threat serves the underground world terrorists, shady business structures, failed states. The unconventional nature of the threat to peace and stability of the New World Order requires an equally innovative response which transcends the formal constraints of international law and the traditional doctrine of deterrence. An analysis of the U.S. foreign policy concepts suggests that today's academic and political community has promoted consensus of neoliberals and neoconservatives, supporters of the institutional functionalism and representatives of the school of Realpolitik. This consensus was based on the recognition of the admissibility of pre-emptive strikes on the territory of failed states, sponsoring international terrorism, or the implementation of open interference in the internal affairs of "rogue states" for human rights and democratic freedoms guarantee.

AB The paper highlights for the first time in the mainstream of historical-philosophical approach such a substantive aspect of Russian religious-philosophical thought of XIX-XX centuries as interpretations of the Byzantine theme (that is, increased attention, until re-actualization, to the Byzantine spiritual heritage, which is evaluated positively or negatively) in the views of P. Ya. Chaadaev, K. N. Leont'ev, G. V. Florovsky, A. S. Panarin, S. S. Horuzhy, M. N. Gromov and others. It reveals the motivation of the actualization of the Byzantine theme in Russian religious-philosophical discourse. Most attention is paid to the characterization of beliefs of A. S. Panarin, and G. V. Florovsky. Byzantine theme has two aspects in the interpretation of A. S. Panarin. The Byzantine Orthodox tradition is considered one of the important bases of identity of Russian civilization. Eastern Christian-oriented interpretation of the Russian civilizational identity does not allow to attribute it to purely Western or Asian types of identity that has implications for cultural and political self-determination of Russia. The second aspect of dealing with Byzantine theme by Panarin is determined by the recognition of its relevance in religious and philosophical terms, as a source of a special type of religious worldviews associated with the experience of space energies of the Orthodox tradition. The Byzantine theme is central in the religious-philosophical and theological works of Georges Florovsky. In the interpretation of Florovsky, theological and philosophical potential of the Byzantine Orthodox tradition was most fully revealed in the age of Palamit disputes. It preserves the value of the sample for subsequent centuries as for its structure and partly in terms of content. This sample was taken into account in the formulation of theological and philosophical program of neopatristic synthesis by Florovsky.

AB Internal return migrant workers (modern seasonal workers or "otkhodniks") are relatively new, but already a mass phenomenon in Russia. We estimate the number of otkhodniks in Russia now in 15-20 million of working-age population. Th is category of migrant workers exists outside the public administration system, primarily occupying the sector of "gray economy". The bodies of state and municipal authorities have not yet formed any definite relationship with migrant workers; no management solutions have been established. Th ere are no management decisions on the regulation of otkhodnichestvo working. Th ere is no regulatory framework. The article, based on field studies in 40 Russian regions and empirical data for 77 municipalities, considers the problem of interaction between the government and migrant workers in three aspects: (1) the ratio of otkhodniks to power, (2) forms and types of interactions between otkhodniks and the authorities, (3) the political significance of modern otkhodniks. The otkhodniks are eliminated completely from the government. They refuse to interact with the government and local self-government. Th ere is no cooperation between the authorities and this category of migrant workers. The authorities underestimate the economic and political importance of modern otkhodniks. All this creates significant social and political threats and risks for the public administration system.

DE architecture; Rome; Ancient Near East; classical antiquity;
   Christianity; temple; apse; tetrastyle; baldachin; ciborium
AB This paper is devoted to the study of some architectural principles and types of spatial organisation that were characteristic of late Roman architecture and expressed some authoritative concepts and later had a great impact on early Christian architecture. A famous art historian A. Grabar proved that many motifs used in late Roman art were influenced by the culture of Near East, which, in turn, influenced early Christian iconography. Before lately the architectural theory was based on the idea by R. Krautheimer and J.B. Ward-Perkins. They thought that the early Christian architecture had no connection at all with late Roman pagan building practice. There are at least three points. Firstly, appearance of halls with apses, typical both for pagan and Christian religious buildings of the 3rd-4th centuries and luxurious palaces and villas of late Roman aristocracy. This tendency could be linked to new political and religious concepts of tetrarchic period. And if we look back, it might also be based on the ideas of ancient Near Eastern kingship. Moreover, the new hierarchical organization of the ruling class that mainly consisted of former military officers was also based on the same ideas. Secondly it is important to examine such an architectural element as the tetrastyle (a four-columned monument usually located on the crossing of the streets of a town or a fortress). It was widely used during the first tetrarchy and was possibly rooted in the idea of concordia - harmony between the four joint rulers. There is a later Christian example of a similar monument built under Justinian with the statues of Evangelists on four triumphal columns. One could suggest that Christians used the tetrarchic iconographical idea for the representation of Evangelists' figures. It is interesting to note that J. Bogdanovich suggested that this architectural element might have become a prototype for the Christian ciborium. The origin of the latter is of a special interest, and this is the third point of our study. Thanks to a lot of numismatic evidence and numerous masterpieces of Roman art we now know that the baldachin rested on four supports and was covered by a flat roof, a barrel vault or a cupola, and it was one of the symbols of representation of god or a divine ruler. This element might come to Roman culture from architecture of Ancient Egypt or Ancient Near East. The study of these motifs that influenced some peculiarities of early Christian architecture together with authoritative and religious concepts they expressed can be very productive and significant for architectural theory.

AB Investigation of the problems of modernization in the context of contemporary globalization megatrend is an urgent theoretical task. In today's Russia, we are witnessing an arbitrary manipulation of the modernization concept in political discourse coming from the common sense, which entails a danger of being detached from the reality of development strategies. In this respect, a comprehensive scientific analysis of the current phase of modernization, characterized by cultural diversity and multi-vector policy, undertaken by a philosopher and sociologist Valentina Fedotova, whose works help to find landmarks in a new system of coordinates, seems timely. The essay reveals the innovative nature of Fedotova's theory, which includes the concept of "third modernity" as a "new modern time for non-Western countries", concept of "national modernization" and original analysis of modernization typology. Special attention is paid to demonstration of heuristic possibilities and practical significance of her approach to the study of modernization processes through prism of cultural factor. The essay also lays out issues and future directions for further investigation of modernization processes, including the task to analyze the traditions in their development, taking into account patterns of intercultural interaction, exploration of the peculiarities of political culture of a certain country in the analysis of the ways of transformation of political and social institutions, etc.

AB Why has constructivism emerged as an important force in the field of international relations and politics in the end of the 20th century? Why constructivism and not any other theoretical approach? The constructivist perspective of international relations appeared as a counterbalance to rationalism that was entrenched in US Political Science throughout the last decades. Analyzing the contemporary state of world affairs through the prism of social constructivism provides us with a unique understanding of how intersubjective perceptions lead to unique epistemic interpretations of reality, which form the ideological framework within which social constructs are being generated. Constructivism succeeds not only in identifying the motives behind the behavior of international actors, but also in unfolding the mechanism through which those motives are being envisaged and accepted through the process of social construction - here lies the greatest value of the constructivist approach in IR theory. Culture formation, nation building, imagined communities, security complexes - the constructivist approach remains an invaluable tool in the arsenal of political analysts, seeking to understand how culture, history, social order, religion, and language project their influence on the international arena and ultimately: why international players behave the way they do?

   political philosophy of science; market economy; technoscience; science
   and education policy
AB The modern existence of science and technology is increasingly being apprehended as a global social problem. What are the political problems continually faced by scientists, engineers, and administrators of science in their practical activity? The fact that it is politics that comes to the fore in science and technology studies is far from being incidental. It is a consequence of the neoliberal trend in the field of science policy broadly criticized by the left intellectuals. They note that neoliberalism refuses to admit the status of science as a public good and requires that basic research be market based and oriented toward innovations and profits even at the expense of the search for new objective knowledge. In this situation, scientists have to join political discussions about the social status of science and about academic capitalism, to problematize the nature of technoscience and its image in society, and to ask questions about the scientific feasibility of governmental decisions and projects. Interestingly, the most extreme manifestation of the neoliberal trend takes place in Russian science policy. The convergence of philosophy of science and political philosophy, which belongs already to one of the major intellectual trends in the West (Bourdieu, Feyerabend, Latour, Callon, Rouse, Sismondo etc.) becomes topical in Russian intellectual circles, also as a part of a political dissident movement.

AB The article considers the social media as a relatively new tool for electoral and political activities for creating a positive image of political parties and candidates (on the example of the European Parliament). The social media are becoming increasingly important in the nowadays world politics due to the growing number of the Internet users, the fall in the popularity of traditional media, and the fast spread of new media as well as the transformation of the Internet into the area for active political actions. The key role in the formation of the political image belongs to political institutions (parties, government agencies), certain politicians and public figures, as well as to representatives of the electorate, i.e. population. The analysis of the efforts of various political actors in the social media allows to identify their three basic functions: a tool to increase voter turnout; a tool to increase the popularity of candidates and parties; a tool to increase public awareness of the political and electoral processes in general. Currently the most serious obstacle for strategic studies of social networks is the tremendous pace of their technological development that complicates long-term predictions in the field. However, despite the lack of universally accepted criteria for assessing the efficiency of political activities in the social media, the author believes that the key success factor is the so-called "permanent presence" of electoral subjects in the Internet.

AB This article examines social media as a relatively new tool of electoral and political activity aimed at creating a positive image of political parties and candidates to the European Parliament. In the modern world of politics it is becoming increasingly important due to such factors as the growing number of World Wide Web users, the decline in the traditional media popularity and the rapid spread of new media, as well as the transformation of the Internet space into the platform for active political interactions.
   The key role in realizing the task of forming political image belongs to political institutions (parties, state bodies), politicians and social activists, as well as population representatives. The analysis of the efforts of various political subjects in the social media roughly demonstrates three functions of this new phenomenon: social media as a turnout increase tool, as a tool of increasing the recognition of candidates and parties by population; as a tool of informing the population about political and electoral processes in society. Currently, the main obstacle for the strategic research in this area is the fact that social networking technologies are rapidly developing, that embarrasses in making long-term prediction on its use. In spite of the absence of recognized criteria giving the opportunity to evaluate political activity in social media, the key efficiency criteria and success factor is so called "permanent presence" of electoral activity subjects in the Internet.

TI THE COMBINATION OF NOMADIC AND HIERARCHIC PRINCIPLES WITHIN THE STATE
   ORGANIZATION IN THE GOLDEN HORDE
SO ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE political and cultural legacy of the Turkic states; Golden Horde; Zero
   point of history; pinnacle of the nomadic civilization; foundations of
   the Russian Empire
AB On the one hand, the state system of the Golden Horde inherits a number of features from the former political culture of the Turkic states. On the other hand, it brings fundamental changes that determine the characteristics of the Eurasian empire. We introduce the concept of zero-point of history to explain periodization of Tatar history. In the history, the smooth flow of events breaks near the bifurcation point, when society enters into an unstable phase and a radical dismantling of social structures begins. Elements of the past remain as invariants. But they find themselves in the new assembly, which cannot be reduced to the same combinations of social elements. This is essentially new historical phase, in which one coordinate system of space-time is replaced by another and history launches a new countdown.
   The Golden Horde is the pinnacle of a nomadic civilization. Its prosperity was based on metallurgy, agriculture, and trade. Moreover, its main export was corn. Hundreds of cities and seaports were built in the Golden Horde, which distinguishes it from the Great Steppe. At the same time, despite the increase in sedentary population, the Golden Horde civilization retained its nomadic mentality. Chinese or European models of governance were basically impossible due to the presence of nomadic economy: it was necessary to control precisely the clans occupying certain territories. Clans were able to ensure both the collection of taxes from the mobile population and training of soldiers for the army. The clan system gave stability in the conditions of semi-nomadic life, while also allowing to control the sedentary population. The Golden Horde was a highly developed State with a strong financial system, with the state apparatus divided into two parts, one of which was associated with control of the nomadic population, and the other with the sedentary one.
   Territory, state structures, traditions, and political culture of the Golden Horde became the basis of the Russian Empire. To the Horde legacy the Orthodox faith was added, borrowed from Byzantium, which together determined the nature of Russia.

DE historical knowledge; Professional Corporation; historian; region;
   Siberia
AB The importance of this research is determined by the specific role of historians as of bearers and translators of a special kind of knowledge. Throughout the modern history, in all states and societies, they have always constituted a specific research and educational corporation different from other academic communities. History has always advocated a particular worldview and has always been a specific sphere of social relations and a special direction of the state policy aimed at ensuring the continuity of generations and the link of times. It has always formed the historical consciousness of the people, their civil and political identity, worldviews, patriotism (in its broadest sense), moral values, etc.
   The research is based on the party and government guidelines and decrees as well as on All-Union and regional legislative documents relating to the national policy and organization of higher education and science. An important source is the documents from Siberian local archives: work reports and minutes of meetings of party organizations of national universities, research institutions and their structural divisions as well as documents of local (municipal and regional) authorities.
   The author uses his own methodology based on the synthesis of three research strategies: the modernization theory, the concept of "centre-periphery relations" and the concept of "internal colonisation" of Siberia.
   The author concludes that over the period under discussion Siberian higher education institutions have prepared several hundreds of qualified historians for secondary schools and educational institutions of different levels. These specialists proved to be very effective for the patriotic education of the Soviet youth, who later participated in the war. University historical departments have laid a solid foundation for the further development of historical education, which helped to prepare a large number of new staff for the liberated regions of the European part of the USSR as well. The role of historians in the rear during the war can hardly be overemphasised, too. Their public campaigns together with other cultural, political, educational and publication work among the population made a tangible contribution to the victory and had a positive effect on the lives of Siberian cities in the rear. All this was possible due to the powerful corporation of Siberian historians that had formed in the pre-war decade.

DE Siberia; national territories; historical education; history
AB The issues of the national territories in Siberia in the 1930s - late 1960s has always been in the focus of the Soviet government, which pursued a policy of deep socio-economic and cultural integration of Soviet peoples via various activities. In particular, it was carried out through the development of historical education (i.e. training local historians), historical research and studies of these regions' past, due to which the Soviet government could integrate the population of national territories into one cultural and historical community of Soviet peoples.
   The research is based on the party and government guidelines and decrees as well as on All-Union and regional legislative documents relating to the national policy and organization of higher education and science. An important source is the documents from Siberian local archives: work reports and minutes of meetings of party organizations of national universities, research institutions and their structural divisions as well as documents of local (municipal and regional) authorities.
   The author uses his own methodology based on the synthesis of three research strategies: the modernization theory, the concept of "centre-periphery relations" and the concept of "internal colonisation" of Siberia.
   The author concludes that Siberian higher education and research institutions during the Soviet time not only became centres for research, educational and cultural life in their national territories, but also contributed much to the solution of many issues relating the national and cultural development, preparing highly qualified national and organizing historical research in their regions.

AB An International Conference dedicated to Roman N. Kim, a prominent East Asian studies researcher and writer, opened on May 26, 2016 in the Academic Council Hall of the IFES RAS The conference, hosted by Institute of Far Eastern Studies of Russian Academy of Sciences, has been attended by historians, political studies researchers, literary critics from Russia, Republic of Korea, Japan and the USA, as well as family members of R. N. Kim. The addresses and speeches delivered were devoted to his biography and literary works, which had exerted great influence on the genre of political detective in Soviet literature, especially upon such famous writers, as V. Vardamatski and Yulian Semyonov. There is a high probability that the literary and cinematic image of the famous Soviet spy Maxim M. Isaev (Stirlitz), Julian Semyonov's literary hero, has been suggested by Roman N. Kim, who had shared the experience of working for the Secret Intelligence in the Russian Far East during the 1918-1922 civil war. Roman Kim was one of the first employees of the Soviet Secret Service, who have later become professionally engaged in literary activity. He was one of the first writers of his time who have estimated the vector of literature development towards documentary prose up to the state where it actually merges with non-fiction literature. Kim was one of the first to use specific literary devices and methods, drawing on experience of journalists, documentary prose writers and scientific researchers. Many pages of his biography are still unknown. Not much is known about his family roots in Korea, nor about his mother's, his family members there have not been found.

DE Shia communities; Persian Gulf; Arab countries; Iran; international
   relations
AB The author studies the influence of the "Shia factor" on the relations between Iran and the Gulf Arab countries. In most countries of the Persian Gulf, there are Shia communities that constitute a significant part of the population. After the Islamic revolution of 1979 relations between Iran and most Arab countries have become particularly tense. In the 1980s, the Gulf monarchies also became wary of exporting the Islamic revolution in their countries. This was due to the fact that, being inspired by the success of the co-religionists in Iran, the Arab Shiites became more involved in politics. It should be noted that the way the Arab Gulf countries treat the Shiites in the region is influenced by the fact that Iran and the Arab Gulf countries compete for political and economic predominance in the region. Often the Shia Muslims are discriminated by the authorities of the Arab countries, and are regarded as the so-called "fifth column" of Iran. In the author's opinion, the policy of oppression of the Shia Muslims in the Persian Gulf monarchies not only worsens the political situation in these countries, but also complicates relations with neighboring Iran. This policy is not constructive. Moreover, the mythical "Iranian threat" does not go to any comparison with the threat posed by the Islamic State. According to the author, although after the execution of the Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr in Saudi Arabia at the beginning of 2016 Iran's relations with Arab countries became even more strained, the further escalation of the conflict is not in the interests of Iran. Especially now, at the initial stage of removing sanctions against Iran's nuclear program, the military operations against the Shiites in the Arab countries may slow down the process. As for Saudi Arabia, in the event of the outbreak of hostilities Riyadh may seriously damage relations with the United States. This is because Washington sees no benefits in involving Saudi Arabia, its biggest ally in the region, into another armed conflict in the region.

DT Article
DE Ivan Ivanovich Kronevald (1919-1995); the Soviet Germans; delegations to
   the Kremlin; the national society "Vozrozhdenie" ("Revival")
AB The article offers an overview of the life and work of Ivan Kronevald, the leader of the Soviet Germans' national movement in the Urals. He was born in 1919 in Saratov, received a degree in History at the local university, and was deported to Kazakhstan and later to the "labor army" in Nizhny Tagil where he lived until his death in 1995. He continued the study of history, defended a thesis focusing on the problems of the Soviet German diaspora and extensively covered the subject in his publications. Kronevald sent several letters to the government authorities requesting greater attention to the Soviet German diaspora. Main problems faced by the Germans in the USSR, according to his point of view, were related to the lack of autonomy, uncertain position of the Soviet Germans, and the language problem. From 1965 to 1989, Kronevald together with the delegations of the German diaspora activistsvisited the Kremlin several times, where they discussed issues of rehabilitation and restoration of the Volga Germans' republic. The result of those discussions was the establishing of the Soviet Germans' society "Vozrozhdenie" (Revival) in 1989. The main aim of the society was the restoration of the Volga Germans' republic. Heinrich Grout was the leader of the society. In the early 1990s, Kronevald gradually went away from public activism concentrating more on academic research. "Vozrozhdenie" ceased to exist in 1993; its goal was not achieved and most of the society's activists emigrated to Germany. Kronevald's heritage includes research papers, as well as active involvement in public and political life on both regional and federal levels. His views and organizational initiatives are maintained in a new and updated form by his successors.

DE Asia's rise; Science; Universities; think tanks; high technologies; IR
   theory
AB For the past few years many IR scholars focused mainly on the question in what way the rise of Asia could influence the post-bipolar world order and world economic system. However with all due attention to the international economic and political transformations, which followed Asia's rise, IR studies paid little attention to the gap between rising economic and to some extent political role of Asia in the world system and still Western-dominated production of new technological and humanitarian knowledge. This article analyses in the comparative way three efforts to bridge this gap. The first one is an effort to build up an indigenous discourse about Asia. The second refers to the discussion about the possibilities to develop a non-Western IR theory. The third one is connected with the rise of Asian think tanks and universities.

AB This article provides information about the Russian scientific conference with international participation "Nomadic peoples of the South of Russia: historical experience and the present", which was held in Elista from 16 to 19 March, 2016. The conference was held at Kalmyk State University with the support of the Russian Humanitarian Foundation. Over 80 representatives of Russian, Ukrainian, Kazakhstan and Chinese universities as well as more than 20 employees of scientific institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences took part in this productive conference. For the first time at a high scientific level and with the participation of Russian and foreign scientists, we investigated the issues of socio-economic, administrative, political and cultural development of the nomadic peoples of the South of Russia and their neighbours, ethnic history and contemporary ethnic processes, as well as various aspects of the cultural and spiritual component in a multi-ethnic processes. The article analyzes the work of the plenary session, which included the reports of scientists from Kalmykia, Buryatia, Dagestan, Kabardino-Balkaria, Astrakhan, Stavropol and Kazakhstan (city of Atyrau). The content of these reports represents the characteristics of nomadic economy and the economic development of the region (S.V. Vinogradov, A.N. Komandzhaev), the social composition (D.S. Kidirniyazov), military cooperation of the peoples of Russia (K.N. Maksimov) historiographical issues (M.E. Kolesnikova), development of customary rights of nomadic peoples (A.U. Turdaliev, S.Zh. Dugarova) and ethno-cultural processes (Kh.B. Mamsirov). Speech by the rector of the Kalmyk State University B.K. Salaeva was devoted to the analysis of the status and prospects of development of higher education in the south of Russia.
   In this article we analyzed the work of three sections on the example of the most typical reports. Reports of the breakout sessions touched upon various issues that affected both domestic nomadic studies in the general and specific historical themes of socio-economic development of the nomadic peoples of the South of Russia and their neighbours. The authors note that during the section sessions participants conducted interesting discussion at a high level. The work of that conference was attended by graduate students and undergraduates, whose performances were also supported by scientists.
   The article concludes with the resolution of the final plenary session of the conference, which highlighted the importance and necessity of conducting such research activities, it emphasizes the importance of scientific research in the field of nomadic studies. The participants expressed the wish to create the permanent coordinating center for the study of history, ethnography and culture of the nomadic peoples of the South of Russia at Kalmyk State University.

AB The article is devoted to the study of changes in the party political space of Russia. On the basis of analyzing the results of the regional elections held on September 13, 2015, Yu.Korgunyuk and S.Shpagin denote the strengthening of the tendency that started a year earlier to "hermetization" of the party political system of the country and to waning of the effect of the 2012 party reform, and at the same time the fragility of the ground beneath this seeming stability. The elections were accompanied by further simplification and flattening of the political space. All regions without a single exception witnessed the number of political cleavages reduced to two. The number of electoral cleavages also dropped. The authors conclude that the 2016 Duma elections will see further tightening of the political and electoral space with fractures along the weakest links. The only question is where exactly these fractures will appear and whether they entail the failure of the whole system.

DE "Academic Case"; Boris Dmitrievich Grekov; the history of the Soviet
   historical studies; JSPD (OGPU); court evidence
AB The so-called 'Academicians' Case' (1929-1931), initiated by the investigating agencies of the OGPU (United State Political Body) involved many outstanding Russian historians of the time (S.F. Platonov, M.K. Liubavskii, Iu.V. Got'e, A. I. Iakovlev, S.V. Bakhrushin, N.P. Likharev, E.V. Tarle, and others). They were convicted and sentenced to various periods of exile.
   B.D. Grekov, who was also arrested in connection with the 'Academics' Case", escaped the tragic fate of his elder colleagues and actively engaged in academic research, being in the focus of a heated debate about social and economic structures. It was Grekov, who developed the Marxist concept of feudal relations in Kievan Rus', which for decades remained fundamental in Soviet historical science. At the end of 1934 he became a corresponding member and, in 1935, a full member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In the late 1930s, he headed the Soviet Institute of History of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the leading organization of Soviet historical science.
   The article contains the unpublished documents from the B.D. Grekov's court files and fills the gaps in the biography of the head of the Soviet historical science of the 1930s-1950s, which abounded in obscurities, thus contributing to the creation of a full picture of his life and work. Refs 17.

The subject of the research is the welfare of an individual and territory of residence. Influence of other spheres is traced by their economic security. An original approach (economic tomography) is proposed, thus enabling a step-by-step monitoring of indicators, detection of threats, and selection of efficient development pathways appropriate for current and future situations.
   The research is presented based on the example of entities of the Ural Federal District that represent the types as having either industrial shape or fuel & energy dominant or agricultural orientation.

   political rights; the comparative-historical method; criteria for the
   comparison of empires; Marxist paradigm; multi-conception approach;
   elite theory; the British Empire; European empires; political rights;
   methodology and ideology
AB The paper assesses the place of Boris Mironov's new, foundational monograph in post-Soviet historiography and the place of the author himself among the number of modern historians. Special attention is paid to the methodological features of the monograph and the creative style of the author, who is the first living Russian historian to liberate his research mentality from the atavism of the Marxist-Leninist paradigm. As a result, Mironov has managed to present the history of the Russian Empire in a new, optimistic perspective, to newly illuminate already well-known subjects, to rightly correct many stereotypes that still affect the perception of the period of the Empire, for both professional and amateur historians. However, according to S.V. Kulikov, Mironov participates in some historiographical stereotypes, in particular, the notion that the history of the Russian Empire begins with Peter the Great, although Baron B.E. Nolde validated another view - that in fact the history of Russia as an empire begins with the 1550s, i.e., from the reign of Ivan IV the Terrible. The article raises the issue of the methodology of comparing the Russian Empire with other European countries that also possessed colonies and, in this sense, were empires. Mironov, according to the existing historiographical tradition, often compares the Russian Empire as a whole (the metropolis plus the colony) with metropoles of the corresponding powers, without considering that their colonies, as in the case of Russia, were legally, politically, and economically a single whole. In this approach, the Russian Empire, in terms of its development, will forever be catching up with other European empires. However, when comparing the Russian Empire with the British and other empires (as a whole), the situation changes, and Russia appears not as a country that follows, but as one that surpasses other European countries, particularly with regard to the beginning of the 20th century - in the degree of prevalence among the population of different parts of the empires of political rights and freedoms, including electoral rights. In Kulikov's opinion, Mironov's new monograph will cause a great interest among wide circles of the representatives of all disciplines of the humanities and will be an outstanding event in Russian historiography of the 21st century.

AB The paper provides identification of political causes and factors of miner protest campaigns in the post-soviet Russia. The following research methods have been applied: contrastive-comparative analysis of literature on historic, sociological, political science, philosophic and economic issues; the method of statistical processing of the information; historical-typological analysis and generalization of documents in force and archival materials; the method of historical simulation. The authors gradually identified the most relevant political causes and factors affecting the development of miner protest campaigns in 1992-1999. Their interdependence on economic and socio-cultural aspects of phenomenon under consideration is also revealed. A comparative analysis with the "perestroika" period (1989-1991) was carried out. The authors made a conclusion that socio-political and socio-economic processes in coal mining regions were highly dependent on the policy of the federal center. The "experimental" nature of reforms in coal mining industry was not supported by additional political powers of leaders in coal mining territories, as the result, the policy was far behind economy and the social sphere of miners. Regional and local authorities were in the conditions of natural (market) selection; therefore, they spent most of their time keeping their political positions by any means, without any attempts to solve the problems in miner towns and settlements.

AB The author briefly reviews books of key researchers in foreign direct investment (FDI) and transnational corporations (TNCs) from the Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) which was the main Soviet center in the field of International Business (IB) studies. Despite of few possibilities of practical application of their results of IB studies Soviet scholars managed to produce some interesting fundamental researches as well as to receive good knowledge of Western achievements in IB studies. Then the article presents modern achievements of IMEMO in this field. Research of Russian TNCs has become the most successful topic of IB studies for IMEMO due to good knowledge of specifics of modern Russian business in contrast to majority of Western scientists. The most interesting results of IMEMO specialists are connected with analysis of mutual FDI relations between Russia and various countries (including the problem of competition between Russian investors and TNCs from European and East Asian countries), rankings of Russian TNCs and new methods of FDI data collection which help to present information on Russian FDI geographical and industrial structure. It was difficult to overcome quickly the gap in theoretical work and quantitative analysis but an original concept of mobilizing factors for FDI was presented as well as some econometric exercises were made with data on mutual FDI in the CIS. According to competitive advantages of Russian scientists, new tasks for their IB studies can be connected with more complicated synthesizing analysis of various sources of FDI statistics (especially for research in Eurasian economic integration), deeper comparative studies of TNCs from various countries (especially BRICS and other emerging markets), unprejudiced analysis of political aspect of foreign expansion of TNCs from Russia and other BRICS, and further theoretical work (e.g. with elaboration of so named corporate map concept).

AB The book of V.A. Kitaev includes reviews of monographs and textbook, collective publications, including encyclopedias, publications of sources, historiographical articles, some of which were published in leading scientific journals in 1980-2015, and some were published for the first time. This publication is not exactly a review to V.A. Kitaev's book, but an attempt to provide the reader with reflections on some of the problems of public thoughts and historiography highlighted by the author: the features of the professional study of history, historiographical analysis as a genre of research, methodology and terminology in modern studies on the history of social thought and historical science, the ratio of professional approach and political convictions, attitude to scientific traditions, etc. The present paper highlights the highest scientific professionalism of V.A. Kitaev, his ability and willingness to be critical not only to other people's research, but also to his own. Despite the well-known assertion that "we do not choose the times", we can safely say that V.A. Kitaev consciously chose the "time of the historian" and found himself in this time.

DT Article
DE Eurasia; Eurasianism; ideocratic state; ideocracy; ruling selection;
   idea-ruler; autarchy; Pan-Eurasian nationalism
AB The article considers the role of the state in the Eurasian doctrine, one of the most distinctive and significant movements of the Russian sociological and political-philosophical thought abroad in the 1920-1930's. The issues addressed by the Eurasians are still relevant under the current epoch of the new Russian statehood construction and to a certain extent are implemented in the contemporary political practice. According to the classical Eurasian doctrine, all nations of "Russia-Eurasia" are united by the "place of development" and constitute a single historical and socio-cultural world, which organically combines elements of the East and the West. The Eurasian doctrine of the state proclaims the idea of strong government and powerful state, which represents the interests of the people and maintains direct connections with its citizens by combining the law and justice principles with the norms of morality, welfare and conscience. The article examines the key Eurasian concept "ideocratic state" and the essential characteristics of the Eurasian concept of the state system, such as ideocracy, autarchy, idea-ruler, and ruling selection. The key state-forming concept is "Pan-Eurasian nationalism" interpreted by the Eurasians as an archetype of ideology, a basis of the national idea. The authors consider basic principles of the socio-economic structure of the Eurasian state, including active participation of the state in the economic life of the country, the coexistence of public and private properties. According to the Eurasian doctrine, the state-planned economy and the state regulation of culture form the foundations of autarchic states that protect the country from economic and humanitarian intervention. The authors come to the conclusion that Eurasian theory of the state can significantly enrich nowadays scientific theory and help to solve the tasks of modernization of the Russian society at the present stage for it takes into account specific national, geopolitical, historical, and cultural characteristics of our state and allows to preserve the identity and diversity of the Eurasian world.

DE modeling; dynamical systems; chaos; bifurcation; mathematical models of
   socio-economic systems; the revolution in Tunisia; "Arab Spring"
AB During the last three decades a mathematical theory of dynamical systems, chaos, and bifurcations has been actively developed and used for the consideration of various fundamental problems and applications. The attempts of using this theory for the study of economic, social, and historical processes were made by the well-known specialists in dynamics of natural sciences and specialists in various social sciences. Such concepts as controlled chaos, dynamical history, and synergetics emerged and have been spread widely. The main difficulty in the mathematical modeling of social historical processes is to construct a suitable mathematical model. Therefore, in recent years there has arisen the trend to give up the idea of constructing complete mathematical models and to use instead basic concepts and common approaches of mathematical theory of dynamical systems for socio-economic, historical or political process. In this paper an approach to modeling the Tunisian social system in the period of 2011 to 2014 is considered and revolution, bifurcation, and controlled stabilization are discussed. Using statistical analysis of socio-economic indicators of Tunisia there two bifurcation parameters are selected which have influenced the stability of the socio-economic system of Tunisia. Based on this analysis recommendations for the socio-economic systems of Tunisia and Russia are offered.

The author shows that Stanislas was not a dreamer but a man of action, often lucky in his long life. Philosopher and enlightened ruler of Lorraine, he turned out to be worthless for the role of the King of Rzeczpospolita largely because of the game "courts and alliances" in the European arena. One of the first among European politicians Stanislas I recognized the future role of Russia in the fate of Poland and in international affairs.

AB In the paper the author examines the origins of rationality concept and its transformation within the framework of economic science. According to the author, rationality is a fundamental concept both for philosophy and for economics. Changes in rational economic behavior model significantly effect on informal institutes (in short-term perspective) and on formal institutes (in long-term period).
   In the paper it is said about significant changes taking place with humanity right now. Today it becomes more and more difficult to describe human behavior by uniform concept of rationality. Now people live in a world that is developing unprecedentedly fast, with the usage of incredible amount of information, countless tasks and social contacts. The development of the Internet and IT tools facilitate this process. Already since the mid-twentieth century advertising and marketing has been influencing people's lifestyle like politics or news. Media resources brands today are comparable to the resources of some political parties or even TV channels what means that advertising today is one of the main factors affecting consumers ' minds and their behavioral model, main feature of which is the premise of rationality or justification of actions.
   The author analyzes the changes of models of rationality over time and, above all, the changes caused by the development of Internet marketing and its tools for monitoring user activity and the impact on decision making in the Network. In conclusion a number of recommendations is given, which can help consumers to save an independence in making decisions in the Internet environment.

AB Subject. The paper studied the regularities of the formation of interactions between participants of the investment project of low-rise housing construction in Russia and developed the method of effectiveness assessment. Goal. The development of basic organizational model of interaction in the implementation of investment projects of low-rise housing construction in Russia. Methods. In this paper, with the help of statistical methods we analyzed investment projects of low-rise housing construction, simulation methods contributed to developing the basic model of interaction of subjects of investment project, using econometric methods we identified basic functions of the considered actors and identified the main risks arising in the course of the project, as well as methods of indicative planning helped to develop a new scheme of interaction between the participants of the investment project of low-rise residential buildings and effectiveness estimation of their interactions. Application area. These results can be applied in the development of sectoral territorial planning documents, as well as in programs for the construction industry development, including low-rise housing. Results. The patterns, the problems of interactions between investment project participants are identified and the economic nature of these problems is reveiled. The authors have shown a new basic model of interaction of actors of low-rise housing construction and the method of evaluating the effectiveness of their interaction. Significance. The importance of this article derives from the fact that with the help of the developed model of interaction of the main actors of the low-rise housing qualitative-functional and subjective spheres can be identified in which functions of low-rise housing actors vary depending on a variety of investment techniques. This model shows the interaction between the actors of the investment project and the level of responsibility of each of them, as well as the efficiency of interaction between the actors in the implementation of the investment project of low-rise housing construction. Conclusion. On the basis of established patterns and developed system of estimation of interactions effectiveness of actors of low-rise residential construction the authors aim the increase the efficiency of interactions between the actors of the investment project, which in turn provides a more precise planning of low-rise housing projects, as well as reduced financial and economic, political, government, force-major risks, planning risks and innovation risks.

DE Orthodox Christianity; religious politicization; ideology; political

AB This essay scrutinizes whether the Orthodox world is something more than just a community of countries sharing a cultural identity. Some commentators suggest that Orthodox civilization might constitute a political community, if Orthodox Christianity is politicized. The author suggests that politicization occurs not through direct application of religion to politics but through a mediatory ideology that can differ significantly from the original belief and should be designated as a "political religion." Worldwide politicization experience is analyzed to show that religion becomes political not in archaic societies, but in modernized and secularized ones. This essay is focused on Russia being the largest country where the population identifies itself with Orthodox Christianity. Two prospective mediatory ideologies are tested, specifically, pan-Slavism and Eurasianism. The author concludes that while politicization of Orthodoxy in Russia is not inevitable, it is very likely in the absence of ideological alternatives and in conditions of multiple social crises.

AB The article reviews documentary sources on history of the 17th-20th century Balkaria from the Archival Fond of the Russian Federation. It describes sources on the subject from the following central and regional archives: the Russian State Archive of Ancient Documents (RGADA), the Russian State Military Historical Archive (RGVIA), the Russian State Historical Archive (RGIA), the St. Petersburg branch of the Archive of Russian Academy of Sciences (SPb. FA RAN), the Central State Archive of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic (CGA KBR). The author offers a classification of documents and underlines the particular nature of information contained in the sources. A comprehensive study of documents collection from the state archives of the Russian Federation pertaining to the history of Balkaria of the 17th - 20th centuries has suggested the following conclusions: data on Balkars can be found in unconnected documents from different archival collections, often discovered accidentally while processing sources on other topics; there are no archival fonds devoted specifically to the population group in either central state or regional archives; targeted search of archival documents on the history of Balkaria of the 17th - 18th centuries has yielded modest results, since most of the sporadic sources found by the author were published in various documents collections. They contain records of political, social and legal relations between Balkar societies, their representatives and neighbour peoples or the Russian government. The archival documents of the 19th - early 20th century allow depict the history of Balkaria during its political and socio-cultural integration into the Russian Empire. According to the author, application of new research methods allowing obtain all relevant data is a major trend for improving the source base on the Balkar history until early 20th century. Practices of applying statistical and mathematical methods in analysis of the 19th - early 20th century mass sources open vast possibilities for obtaining scholarly results from studying known materials on Balkar history.

DE Ibn Khaldun; philosophy of history; Ottoman intellectual tradition
AB The prominent Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406), author of the famous Muqaddimah (Prolegomena, or "Introduction"), is considered by many scholars as 'the father of the philosophy of history'. In his study of history he strived to follow a scientific method and gave economic and natural factors prevalence over religious belief in his explanation of the origins. and development of the state and civilization. Political changes which occurred in the Islamic world during the 15th century (territorial expansion and apogee of the Ottoman Empire) proved a major inspiration for. the development of Ottoman historiography. Ibn Khaldun was to remain a dominant influence on Ottoman intellectual tradition until the 20th century; this is why contemporary Turkish historians designate this centuries-old tradition as 'Ibn Khaldunizm' (Ibn Haldunculuk). Scholars belonging to it made significant contributions to many fields of knowledge. Among their achievements it is to point out that they were responsible for the uninterrupted study of Ibn Khaldun's work during the Middle Ages and up to its 'discovery' in the West in early 19th century; they made appear, in the first half of the 18th century, the first translation of Ibn Khaldun's Prolegomena (Muqaddimah) from Arabic into any other language (Ottoman Turkish); they continued to develop and, in some respects, to expand Ibn Khaldun's theory of the state.

AB The aim of the research is an identification and detecting weak signals that could predict future events in context of protest activity and riots, trying to indicate them beforehand.
   In this work we have tried to design and implement a weak signal detection approach on the base of feature analysis on a variety of datasets from social media by applying a machine learning methods. We used a sample use case with a dataset which was manually labeled by expert. Semantic and sentiment features to the traditional syntactic features were combined. Through the procedure, we also tried to give a detailed analysis on the performance of our approach, and showed it for particular dataset and how it could work in real-time analytics.
   We used expert estimations for building sample set of tweets on the base of 9 events containing the total number of 19000 tweets marked by several features: related to event brought to riots and protests, related to riots and protests itself, and sentiment attitude to riots and protests.
   Given the sample data we have build models (SVM, linear and logistic regressions) in order to classify tweets to have the features mentioned above. We used cross-validation technique and accuracy, models obtained show good accuracy and effectiveness.

AB The purpose of research is to identify factors of social and economic environment influencing drug addiction and to verify the hypothesis that drug addiction is more economic problem than social or medical.
   The methodology of research is an econometric modeling of drug addiction with regard to the impact of different economic and social factors. We have build linear and logistic models and identified the role poverty, unemployment and other parameters on the level of drug addiction in Russian regions. In order to take into account possible diversity of Russian regions with reference to the patterns of drug addiction we made preliminary clusterization of regions.
   Due to the fact of huge diversification between Russia regions in terms of the typology of drug situation we had made preliminary classification of regions on the basis of their profile in order to provide few econometric models. Classification was made by SVN method and k-means.
   Modeling of the influence of social and economic factors on drugs addiction in Russian regions was made with logistic and linear regression. As a performance criteria we used accuracy value.
   Models obtained show good accuracy and effectiveness. According to the results of modeling we found high priority of economic and social measures in counteraction to drug addiction.

AB Following the old tradition, political analysts tend to exaggerate the role of economic and resource factors, which repeatedly leads to prediction errors. The paper shows that in most historical cases, mental contents, conditions and fluctuation in mass moods, ambitions and capacities of authorized leaders etc. determine social events more significantly than any outside factors. Economic and political spheres interweave during quiet phases and far diverge as crisis phase is approaching. In addition, the proportion of the mental component in the causal dependency has been growing throughout human history; in the 21st century, it is the evolution of worldviews, values and meanings that finally determines the viability of our planetary civilization.

AB The article analyzes the transformation of Islamic community of the Adygheya Republic during 1990-2015, new tendencies and actors. The author reveals new trends in the 2010s updated by the dynamics of the political background of Adygheya. The main focus is the factors constraining Muslims from radicalism in the 1990s - 2010s, as well as factors that may contribute to the spread of radical version of Islam today. According to the author, the factors of radicalization of Muslims in the Adygheya can be divided into two groups - federal and regional. The first concerns the many unresolved methodological issues relating to "New Muslims". As practice shows, the state unequivocal support of the "traditional Muslim clergy" contributes to the isolation of Salafis, limits the possibilities of intraconfessional dialogue. The facts of destruction of mosques, injunction religious books, extra-judicial persecution of Muslims and ban on headscarves (hijabs) in schools in the other regions of the Russian Federation forms the protest discourse. At the regional level a crisis of ethnic ideology Adyghe Khabze, economical crisis and broken social lifts contribute to the radicalization of Muslims. Islamic radicals are very active and professional in social networks, they create the groups whose target audience is youth. The activities of the radical "Internet imams", electronic "religious authorities" are typical for Adygheya and for the whole North Caucasus outside the native region. Their influence, agitation and propaganda are destructive and will have a negative impact in the future. A new trend is the departure of the Adyghe Muslims in ISIL (about 21 people from the beginning of 2015).

AB The modernity world order is in a crisis, getting into non-equilibrium, possibly a permanently mobile state. Its border limits are the highly organized transnational neonomadic Community (New North) and area of the new archaic (Deep South), marked with the stigmata of the culture of death, the presence of warlords and captured. The XX century was the century of permanent revolution; the XXI century risks becoming a time of permanent war. Post-modernity converts the space of combat operations, forming a new norm, using new tools, creating new threats. The concept of "hybrid warfare" reflects the set of aggressive manipulations, application of a wide range of tools that create complex combinations of direct and indirect threats to the enemy. Such "war" extends the capabilities of conventional politics and focuses on the deconstruction of adverse circumstances, submission or decomposition of the enemy with the purpose of reorganization of the existing and / or establishment of a new political order. The situation in Syria is an example of such a hybrid plot. It crossed several dimensions: global, regional, confessional, ethnic-national, post-modern. The phenomenon of the ISIS (DAISH) presents the world an innovative political organism, challenging the values of modernity in their confessional and traditionalist interpretations, although not exclusively. This is also a specific post-modern challenge, a simulacrum, containing its own game and value component. It is not the first time when the theme of a toxic state appears on the agenda of modernity, presenting the most traumatic inclusion in the modern text (in the form of post-colonial post-imperial limitrophe states). Retrospective analysis helps to detect the similar processes of active "conservative futurism" (utopianism), unfolding in similar circumstances, but historically occurring in other forms. In a globally integrated society, local and regional crises can lead to a cascade developing processes that have universal significance. The modern event trajectories under critical circumstances are characterized by cascade effect: actions can cause a chain reaction, calling into question the future of the world system.

   The analysis of legislation on innovation activity includes acts of the EAEU (The Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union of 29.05.2014), acts of the Eurasian Economic Community (Decision of the Interstate Council of the EAEC of 11.12.2009 No 475 "On Conception on the formation of Eurasian innovation system"), acts of the Commonwealth of Independent States (Model Innovation Code, 2014; model laws "On technical parks", 2012; "On scientific parks", 2013; "On public-private partnership", 2014, etc.) and laws of countries-members of the EAEU (the Russian Federation, the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Kyrgyzstan).
   The study of the Russian Federation legislation covers both federal and regional levels (for example legislation of Moscow).
   The conclusion is made about the insufficient level of legal base systematization of countries-members of the EAEU regulating the innovation activity, the absence of clear definitions of an object of regulation and identity of terminology, approaches to the composition of innovation activity subjects, which are conditioned by the complex and multiple-aspect character of the legal relationship under study.
   In current legislation the separate norms on innovative activity are uncoordinated and provided for different acts; the interconnection of innovative and industrial infrastructure is not defined.
   The results of the research are presented in the form of proposals of the unification and harmonization of legislation on the innovation activity in countries-members of the EAEU.
   It seems necessary to work out the Legal Basics of the EAEU on innovations and innovation activity, which will be directed at determining common terminology, forms of the countries' cooperation in the sphere of innovation, optimal schemes of innovative technologies transfer and financial mechanisms of interaction.
   The results of the research can be applied in the field of legal and economic sciences, in the spheres of state administration and activity of supranational organs of the EAEU.

DE Corruption; Post-Soviet Studies; Justice; Justification; Public Opinion
AB We have examined two approaches to Corruption as a social phenomenon. Within the framework of political and legal approach, corruption is regarded as social pathology being an indicator of the social order violation. This approach is dominant.
   The definition of corruption is a key at this stage of social science development which is reflected in the laws that are aimed at fighting corruption in Russia. However, it ignores the function that corruption accomplished in post-socialist societies and considers its main cause to be some special criminal motivation of the participants.
   Representatives of functional and phenomenological approaches seek to investigate corruption as a norm of a particular state of society. In this study, the norm is referred to as widespread phenomenon, not as a normative ideal, and the distinction between "informality" and corruption is based on this stipulation. Given that, "informality" is declared to be the norm and becomes acceptable exception of the rule. Corruption is perceived as a sign of uncertainty proper to the Russian society. If Russian society is transformed into the Western modernist ideal, the "informality" should be regarded as an acceptable expense of the market economy, and corruption is to be prevented by law (as in the regulatory and legal approach).
   The phenomenological approach is more preferable from the point of view of functionality of the research. It does not limit the researcher in the selection of the normative ideals and allows to define one's own criteria for classifying corruption either as a norm or a pathology.
   In order to clearly identify the one of the two research positions, one must answer the following questions: What is the type of the Russian society (post-modern, contemporary or quasi-contemporary); What social order is transmitted and reproduced in the Russian society?
   The idea of Justice can be used both to justify the existing corrupt practices and orders, and to combat them effectively. In 2015, series of in-depth interviews was conducted in the regions of Central and Western Ukraine. Some specific features have been established in the Ukrainian extraction of the study. In contrast to the representatives of the Russian community, colleagues from national security, defence and law enforcement agencies do not constitute a single entity. On the other hand, representatives of the nonintegrated national security agencies (Security Service of Ukraine, Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Armed Forces of Ukraine) treat each other with suspicious. The same practices are observes in the relations between Russian "old militia" and "the new police." Unlike Russia, Ukrainian external referents of social order are never associated with community house hold infrastructure (clean / dirty courtyards, bad / good roads, presence / absence of lightening in the communal entrance hallways, etc.). Noticeable difference between Russian and Ukrainian perception of corruption is observed towards corruption in healthcare, the Ukrainian respondents often perceive corruption to be just for a medical professionals. A doctor caught on a bribe doctor is usually seen as a "scapegoat" of the medical community.

AB Nikolay Oleynikov and Oxana Timofeeva are members of the Saint Petersburg-based collective Chto Delat, a group of nondogmatic Marxist artists, philosophers, and activists. Members of the group are in continuous interdisciplinary dialog. This artwork is an example of the circulation of ideas, images, and practices that flow from the members of the collective, influencing the singular studies of each artist, and back from the singular exercises of each artist, enriching the practices of the collective. Combining the images of Oleynikov and a text by Timofeeva, the artwork analyzes a collective dimension of spirituality that through artistic political practices uncovers a series of transformations of animal bodies, addressing the nonhuman aspects of the phenomenon of comradeship. In this uncovering, questions of solidarity, pain, and utopian community are raised and actualized in the encounter between text and image.

ID INSTITUTIONS
AB Social innovation permeates the socio-economic dimension and it is the one of the effective instruments for improving the public welfare. Therefore, it has ignited growing academic and practical interest. However, despite of the increased interest in the designated research field, it has not yet formed a unified theoretical and methodological basis of social innovations. Besides, such an important aspect of social innovations as the evaluation of parameters, which can scale social innovations in the socio-economic dimension and expose lacks, is completely unexplored and unformed. Hence, the aim of this paper is to develop an original approach to quantitative scaling that allow analysing the allocation of social innovations in the socio-economic dimension. The concept of d social innovation" is interdisciplinary, so that the research included the integration of the modern economic theory, sociology, philosophy and political science for developing a common approach to the analysis of social innovations. We have used various methodologies as a groundwork such as: neo-institutional and neoclassical economic approaches, categorical and instrumental apparatus of the institutional-evolution economic theory, the theory of public sector economy, and the economics of knowledge. To achieve the objective of our research we developed a definition of social innovations. Besides four the most important measurable parameters, which allow us to classify social innovations according to their signs, were developed. These parameters were the basis for scaling of social innovations. Authors have analyzed thirty-two social in Ural region. It allows identifying spheres in public sector, which are less provided with social innovations.

AB The ideologemes of Moscow as the New Jerusalem and New Rome, first emerged during the eminence of Moscow as seat of the unified Russian State. Such ideology primarily was gaining its foothold in the political consciousness of Russian ruling elite in the 16 th and in the early 17 th centuries.

The contributors are analyzing the particular hymn "Shine! Shine!

AB In the article the authors attempt to re-conceptualize the idea of "mass politics" that is necessary for a more adequate understanding of the causes, factors and characteristics of growing mass political activity in Russia and around the world. Mass politics is viewed as the processes, which take place within the institutional space of mobilization, representation, participation and action. It is proposed to differentiate types of mass politics according to a distinction between concepts of "mass politics", "politics of citizens", and "politics of multitude". The criteria used to categorize specific forms of mass activity are selected. The politics of citizens is defined by its' participants orientation towards fulfillment of their citizen rights and freedoms, or towards fight for a provision / extension / practicing thereof. The individuals getting into the politics of masses, are in their pre-civil, pre-legal condition, they essentially dismantle (modern) politics. The politics of multitude is practiced in an extra-state space of freedom and equality, where an individual is fulfilling human rights. Taking S.Rokkan's models of institutionalization and cleavages as a starting point, the authors elaborate a model which describes the foundations of mass mobilization and institutionalization of mass politics; they list a number of parameters which have to be analyzed to estimate the possibility of development of the politics of citizens, or of the politics of masses. Some of these parameters are verified using data from the mass survey conducted in the summer of 2014. It is demonstrated that in Russia there are preconditions for the emergence both of the politics of masses and of the politics of citizens. The survey data indicate some risks of individuals' transforming into a mass; at the same time, there are groups of respondents who have to some extent mastered the citizens' roles. Formation of a civic identity - empowerment - is a key condition for a democratic transformation of the political regime in Russia.

Gaman-Golutvina in 2015 in connection with the anniversary of RPSA (Russian Political Science Association). The authors conclude that the achievements of contemporary Russian political science are based on the ideas and traditions developed by Russian social scientists in XIX-XX centuries. At the same time the political thought in the country is not developing in isolation, but within the main trends of international political science and in close cooperation with IPSA (International Political Science Association). Having joined the debate on some of the most important aspects of political life Soviet and Russian scholars have made their contribution to broadening the interpretations of such notions as "political culture", "public politics", "state governance", "network interactions", which makes development of sub-disciplines within political science and synthesizing, inter-disciplinary studies increasingly relevant. The five-volume study also raises issues that will have to be resolved by the political science community in the nearest future. A special attention is given to the analysis of regional aspects of the research and the creation of regional academic schools that have demonstrated their potential and analytical capacities when researching the political landscape of Russia. Today the regional schools that have their own local distinctive features and different resource base ensure the diversity of views and approaches to the analysis of the political reality. The Russian political scientists, who are striving to develop themselves in connection with foreign academic centers and using their findings, are rooted in the achievements and traditions of the national political thought and see the future of the discipline as a fully-fledged academic school in the world political science.

DT Article
DE future (le futur); l'avenir; plurality; Maidan; Derrida; Spinoza; Hobbes
AB This article considers two models of the future based on Jacques Derrida's distinction between le futur and l'avenir. The former is related to technology, including political technology, and the latter involves an experience of participation, which allows for the existence not of "the future" ( le futur), but of "forthcoming" ( l'avenir). L'avenir is on the side of direct democracy and unmediated political action. The future and l'avenir are different kinds of time. The future is projective, l'avenir is event driven. The future is predictable; l'avenir refers to what we might call absolute openness. L'avenir is the experience of encountering the other, including in the field of politics. The author believes that Maidan creates a space for this second conception of time, continuing the line of political philosophy coming from Baruch Spinoza and his idea of multitudo and absolute democracy.

AB The author studies the academic activity of Dzhuchi M. Tugan-Baranovsky, defines the sphere of his academic interests, gives the characteristic of his major works. The special attention is paid to the analysis of the works devoted to the formation of the political regime of Napoleon Bonaparte and identifying the endowment made by the historian in studying the history of French studies in Russia.
   D. M. Tugan-Baranovsky attached great importance to the period of the Consulate, stressing the prevalence of the Napoleon's regime at that time. In this period the real opposition, both from the side of the royalists and Republicans was eliminated. Based on an extensive range of sources the historian analyzed various attempts of drafting a Republican conspiracy against Napoleon. The historian explored major transformations of the period of the Consulate: the reorganization of the financial system, judicial reform, establishment of the new administrative system and its subsequent evolution. He noted that the complex reforms of Napoleon were not only the political but also of great social importance. D. M. Tugan-Baranovsky claimed that Napoleon's regime had much more connection with the inner end of the bourgeois revolution than it appeared in the Soviet literature.
   In recent years D. M. Tugan-Baranovsky has addressed issues of social and economic history of Russia in the late 19th - early 20th centuries and the study of political and scientific activities of his grandfather M. I. Tugan-Baranovsky. The author of the article shows what aspects of the work of the scientist-economist have attracted the attention of D. M. Tugan-Baranovsky.

AB Nowadays a lot of services sphere organizations are shifting into the realm of science-intensive sectors of the national economy, generating, producing various innovations, among them in the areas of infrastructural, utility and everyday services, computer, engineering, telecommunications, medical, educational technologies and services. This promotes dynamic development of the services sphere.
   An important position in the services sector is occupied by everyday services for the population. Along with that, the network of everyday services companies and their branches is underdeveloped in rural areas, especially in peripheral towns and villages, which presents a weakness of the sphere of everyday services. It is common knowledge that utility companies, both state and private, suffer from serious personnel problems.
   An important role in the functioning and development of the local services sphere and in particular in the areas of everyday, utility and social services, belongs to municipal administrations, since "rapid progress in the local services sector will serve as a catalyst for local development capable of launching a continuous chain of intrinsic changes in the economy of a municipality". Yet not all local administrations pay due attention to that, for which reason a number of urgent problems with certain services of everyday nature and services of market infrastructure are neglected and left to their own devices. Whereas in present-day conditions local administrations should not only encourage the development of a variety of services but also actively promote and take part in it themselves.
   The subject of state regulation of the services sphere has not been extensively developed by Russian authors. A lot of operational aspects of the services sector, including management and state regulation under present-day market conditions and the specifics of its development in Russia, remain insufficiently studied, which points to the vast potential for extensive and intensive development of this field of economics as well as its importance for the national economy.
   This work focuses on studying how state (including regional and municipal) policy influences the development of the services sector.

DE Russia; conservator; tradition; Orthodoxy; conservatism; reforms
AB First two volumes of the anthology "Conservators of Russia" present a unique collection of spiritualphilosophical and historical-political texts belonging to those who have been creating and safekeeping Russia during the first eight centuries of its Christian history. It is not self-evident to place these thinkers into category of "the conservatives" since the classic domestic conservatism conventionally emerged not earlier than in 19th century. Conceptual introductions to both volumes give us opportunity to overcome the difficulty, which is rather an issue of methodology than chronology. For the period of 11th-17th centuries, the idea of safekeeping Russian statehood as the only independent stronghold of Orthodoxy acquired a clearly conservative meaning. In the 18th century, the idea of self-sufficient Empire comes to the fore and gives rise to "a new. conservatism." Three dots in this author's formula emphasize the fact that in the 18th century, there was not so much conservatism as such, but rather a search for its new forms dominated.

AB The article is devoted to analysis of formation processes of interaction between the state, civil society and business in Russia. As an empirical basis the authors use the results of sociological research conducted by Public Opinion Fund in 2015, scientists of the South-Russian Institute of Management - Branch of Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration in 2012 and 2016. 44 % of respondents in the regions expressed a preference for the social partnership of government, business and civil society. The authors believe that the implementation of the mission of the Social Contract-2030 is possible through the mechanism of public-private partnership (PPP), which is the most promising and effective institution in modern economic-political condition of Russia. The strategic goals of the state consist in providing transfer of the country to the path of innovative development, aimed at reducing the export-resource dependence of the country in the context of the mission of Social Contract-2030 and the national security strategy of the country is impossible without formation of a partnership between the state, companies and commercial structures. Each of the members of the partnership provides a contribution to the implementation of the project. The business structure for its part contributes investment funds, human resources, effective business technologies, flexibility and responsiveness in decision-making, innovation and other private initiatives and available resources. The state in turn provides a partnership through their powers with necessary legal and institutional resources that ensure protective measures for the formation of a competitive and low-risk business. The main task of civil society is to help citizens in solving social problems and the implementation of control over the power structures in the fulfillment of social obligations of the state. The question of increasing the efficiency of mechanisms of Social contract-2030 implementation between the state, society, and business implies transparency of activities of public authorities and effective management of results.

AB The article is dedicated to the social myth-making problem which became relevant again in the 21st century due to the processes of globalization and informatization, the new geopolytical balance of power and the mixed political situation. This article considers the myth as a specific way of the surrounding reality exploration, rooted in far past but manifesting its phenomenal survivability and revivability. The author focuses on the essential features of the social myth which remain in demand under modern conditions. The article also analyzes the features of the modern age which lead to extension of the functional field of the mythological consciousness. The author is guided by the huge potential of the myth as a way of the goal-directed impact on social consciousness. At that, the ambivalence of the myth and its ability to play the historically different roles in modern society is emphasized. The author is sure that without mastering the mechanism and the ways of functioning of the social myth, as well as without seizing the point of this phenomenon and the nature of the secondary ideological myth-making, it is impossible to struggle effectively with this phenomenon or manage this process successfully. Thus, this research task, on one hand, is the theoretical solution of the problem of mythological invariant and the modern transformations of the myth and, on the other hand, the identification of the practical relevance of this topic to manage the mass consciousness processes in the sociopolitical and ideological areas.

AB The paper contains an analysis of approaches to address the concept of energy security. It proposes an original method for the quantitative evaluation of energy security of a territory. It is based on an indicative analysis and consists of a set of performance indicators that describe individual threats to Russia's energy system. The methodology is based on 7 units of indicators, including technical, economic, and environmental performances. Such a structure of the set of diagnostic tools allows detecting a wide range of energy security threats. A brief description of all the units within the methodology is provided. This set of indicators reflects (describes) key threats to energy security. The main results of the study relate to evaluating of the dynamics of changes in energy security in Russia's regions in 2000-2015. Key factors that lower the level of energy security in Russia have been identified. Among them, a high level of wear and tear, higher fuel consumption, increased emissions of pollutants, and low rates of technical reequipment of the energy complex. The paper represents calculated levels of energy security for major regions of Russia by diagram. It proposes directions of the country's energy policy to increase the level of energy prosperity.

DT Article
DE theoretical approaches; conflict resolution; protracted conflicts;
   Nagorno-Karabakh conflict; Transnistrian conflict
AB Protracted conflicts belong to the most complex and controversial issues of the contemporary international security in Europe, both from a practical and from a research perspective. Conflicts of this kind in the post-Soviet space compose an especially acute problem. The article argues that in order to resolve them it is necessary not only to choose appropriate political and peacekeeping tools, but also to find adequate research tools. This requires to start primarily with a study of theoretical foundations. Although this topic is analyzed in a large number of works, theoretical approaches in the study of protracted conflicts are applied not deep and not wide enough. It is noted that many research and analytical works lack the use of theories from international and conflict studies, especially the interdisciplinary application of them. In addition, while using such theories for the analysis, specific features of protracted conflicts should be taken into account: the long-term character of unsettlement, distribution beyond a conflict area, their influence on different security levels, as well as formation of special "conflict" state of identity in areas of protracted crises. The article discusses several theories of peace and conflict research and international relations studies that help to enhance and structure research tools for a complex interdisciplinary analysis. These are: the theory of "protracted social conflicts", the theory of regional security complexes, the securitization theory and the "ripeness" theory of conflicts. The practical application of these theories is shown in terms of two protracted conflicts in Europe, on the post-Soviet space - Transnistria and Nagorno-Karabakh cases. The author proposes to use these theories to study the phenomenon of protracted conflicts, which could help to structure and organize a research work at a conceptual level in order to overcome many difficulties in conflicts explanations. The combination of theories from different research fields gives an opportunity to conduct a comprehensive interdisciplinary study and find a new perspective for these seemingly intractable conflicts, as well as options for their possible resolution.

AB The article deals with the prerequisites and establishment of the first Russia-Mexico contacts, which took place after the Crimean War (1853-1856). It was revealed that Mexico's interest in the collaboration with Russia began to reveal in a higher degree after the Crimean War. The factors, which had led to the diplomatic rapprochement of the two states, include the Mexico's search for allies in the contradiction to increased aggression of European states and the USA in the Central American region, and the increase of Russian intellectuals' emigration, resettlement of religious groups of the Old Russian sectarians to the region. At the turn of 19th-20th centuries many Russian travelers and writers, such as S.D. Protopopov and K.D. Balmont, visited Mexico for the purpose of studying the culture of ancients Indians, who lived in Central America during many centuries before the Spanish colonization. Besides of the impressions on ancient Indian culture, these travelers described the life of ordinary Mexican people of that time. They mentioned their poverty and hopelessness in the years of Porfirio Dias's dictatorship. Nevertheless, political and cultural contacts had begun to established in the late 19th century between the Russian Empire and Mexico, because after the Crimean War the Mexico's interest to Russians increased. In addition, Russia tried to strengthen its position in Central American region. In total, these factors had led to the strengthening of political, social and cultural contacts between Russia and Mexico.

AB The article presents the second part of the research on the American Pirate Parties political practice. It deals with political activity of the United States Pirate Party and Pirate Parties of particular states, focused on preservation of the basic democratic values (liberty of speech and free information exchange, personal privacy, government transparency and responsibility) in the following forms: protest actions against national legislation and international agreements violating civil rights; promotion of laws protecting civil rights in the digital space; creation of alternative computer networks independent from state agencies and large corporations. By contrast with European Pirate Parties which have managed to achieve a significant presence in local, national and regional legislative bodies (including the European Parliament) within the decade from 2006 till today, the American "pirates" have failed to obtain an official registration at the national level during the same period of time, and have only had temporary or local success. This is accounted for far more complicated political conditions of their efforts to overcome much stronger economic lobbies and a political bias in the government. American Pirate Parties in association with civil rights organizations and IT-companies are permanently fighting consecutive bills (COICA, PIPA, SOPA, CISPA, CISA) attempting to restrict civil rights of Internet-users in favor of copyright holders and information market lobbies, which leads to legalization of state censorship and surveillance. Moreover, there are state surveillance programs like PRISM and international agreement (ACTA, TPP) secretly brought into action, which also pose a challenge to civil rights and democratic values protection. As long as these threats exist, a necessity to restore social justice will continue to persist, especially in the information field, where the freedom of Internet serves as a crucial indicator for democracy itself.

AB The article presents the first part of the research on the American Pirate Parties activity from their formation (dating back to 2006) up to the present time. It deals with the history of the Pirate Movement in the U.S., main events that defined its present condition, shaping of its ideological platform based on the political philosophy of cyber-libertarianism. The process of globalization involving not only the economic domain and world policy, but also the information sphere, creates strong challenges to information as a public asset. Capitalizing of the "information market" by few large corporations at the domestic level (in the U.S.) and worldwide, regarding the information of any kind as a business commodity, lobbying of private companies' interests for a change in the law lead to multiple civil rights violations, state censorship, social injustice. In the digital world, the violation of civil rights is often disguised, and may not be as vivid as in the real life. But in the information age, preservation of democratic values becomes highly essential exactly in this sphere, especially in the Internet. The American "Pirates" are the only political force in the U.S. that defends the Internet as an open source for all. Concerning not only copyright matters, but also the freedom of speech and information exchange, personal privacy and government transparency issues, electoral system and state officers' professional responsibility, etc., the "Pirate Movement" directly challenges affluent information market lobbies, American state agencies and legislation bodies. Therefore, it presents an alternative political force setting ambitious tasks in the political and social field.

AB Transformation of modern society affects all fields. The goals and objectives of social development as well as the means to achieve them require science-based mechanisms, methodological support for studying social phenomena and their philosophical and sociological analysis. Both integrative and differential processes characterize modern scientific activity. The key reason for science institutionalization as a sociocultural phenomenon is its social inclusion. In this process science integrates with such social institutions as education, management and etc. The paper deals with research activities in higher education institutions. The importance of this study is determined by the increasing role of research activities in social, economic, political, legal and cultural development of society. In a modern society the process of institutionalization requires its dynamic development. Science has issues that should be examined. The socio-cultural basis of scientific activity changes is a key one for studying. The goal of this study is to analyze the historical validity of the characteristics of research activities in terms of sociocultural determinants. The authors carried out system and comparative analyses and a logical-historical study of the transformation of research activity phenomenon. In conclusion, sociocultural determinants of research activity formation and development are revealed in today's changing conditions of social factors; the definitions to such concepts as "research interest" and "research needs" are given.

AB A collective monograph "History of the Tatars of the Western Cisuralic Region. Vol. I. The Nomads of the Great Steppe in the Cisuralic Region. Medieval Tatar States" [1] has been published by Sh. Marjani Institute of History (Kazan, 2016). The volume is dedicated to the medieval period and ends with the fall of the Kazan Khanate. The monograph has been prepared under the supervision of Doctor of Historical Studies, R.S. Khakimov. Editorial board of the monograph consists of leading scholars from academic centers in Russia and abroad. The book is divided into 4 chapters. The first chapter talks about the history of ancient nomads in the Cisuralic region. The second chapter examines the Volga-Kama Bulgaria and political unification of the Turkic nomads. The third chapter is dedicated to the formation of the Golden Horde state and the history of the formation of the Tatar people. The final fourth chapter discusses the Tatar khanates (Kazan and Siberian yurts, the Nogai Horde). An appendix including 55 narrative source is an important part of the collective monograph "History of the Tatars of the Cisuralic Region". The authors of the first volume have not only succeeded to considerably fill the lacuna of historical knowledge about the Cisuralic Tatars, but also largely revise existing ideas about ethnogenesis of other Turko-Tatar and Finno-Ugric peoples in the region. This work does not provide all the answers. However, the important thing is that the authors of the monograph have succeeded to present new problems and outline prospects for further research. In the future, it is necessary to continue to study the process of ethnic migrations, which began in the Cisuralic region in the middle of the 16th century as well as the problems linked to the inclusion of these communities into the Russian state and other issues related to the history of the Cisuralic Tatars.

DT Article
DE social policy; policymaking process; critical theory; foster families;
   orphans; social workers; child protection
AB This study reflects upon problems in social policy towards orphans, with a focus on interactions between potential and actual foster parents and the staff from state social services. The concepts of policymaking processes and political cycles are used to analyze state policy towards children. The relations between professional social workers and (unprofessional) foster parents are described by referring to the framework of critical theory. State social policy is regarded as a link fulfilling two goals: reinforcing the legitimacy of state power and ensuring the public remains loyal to the authorities. Social policy is analyzed as a series of political conflicts. Public policy as a process includes the following stages: the identification of problems, agenda setting, policy formulation, policy legitimation, policy implementation, and, finally, policy evaluation. Critical theory prefers to see the professional social worker as an agent of public control and a representative of power. Thus, both approaches identify public policy as a tool of power and control rather than help and care. This case study includes policy analysis, a qualitative analysis of the media. ten in-depth interviews with foster mothers from Moscow and the surrounding region, as well as nine expert interviews. According to the results of our study, five strategies can be identified in the interactions between professionals and foster parents: 1) state attempts to control the family, 2) the attempts of parents to control the authorities by blaming them for problems, 3) the cooperation of officials and foster parents as equal partners, 4) a strategy of ignorance where the care authorities claim to be 'just doing their jobs', and 5) genuine care for the children and families from the side of the state.

   energy ties; military-technical cooperation; foreign policy;
   international relations
AB Since the beginning of the 21st century, Sino-Venezuelan relations have witnessed remarkable strengthening. This approach reflects China's commitment to enhance unity and cooperation with developing countries, to ensure national oil security and to expand markets. The fundamental feature of modern Sino-Venezuelan relations is China's growing economic influence on the Bolivarian Republic. Over the last 15 years, the PRC has managed to become the second largest trading partner of Venezuela and the largest creditor of Caracas. Venezuela needs China's financial support to develop social projects and thus to ensure domestic political stability. The intensification of economic relations between two countries promotes their cooperation in the international arena. Caracas is largely in tune with Beijing, when it comes to foreign policy issues. At the same time, China's proposals seem to be more restrained and sensible compared to Venezuela's radical foreign policy rhetoric. Therefore, Beijing is not ready to support Venezuela's anti-American initiatives despite the fact that China by no means advocates the American hegemony. Nevertheless, Venezuelan anti-American rhetoric, especially manifested during Hugo Chavez's rule, allows Beijing to assess the limits of Washington's tolerance. Beijing also expands arms sales to Caracas, which can be treated as China's response to the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and to the American military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. China's growing ties with Venezuela cause concerns in the United States, which for centuries have seen Latin America as its sphere of influence. Beijing doesn't want to provoke Washington in the region. The "triangular relationship" (involving the United States, China and Venezuela) requires China to adjust various foreign policy goals. The article attempts to examine objectives and to evaluate the achievements of the PRC's policy toward Venezuela. The author tries to explore possible implications of closer cooperation between the countries amid changes in the Venezuelan political balance.

AB Communicative direction in the study of social reality has a theoretical basis and application results obtained in the framework of existing conceptual approaches and research paradigms. Every science or scientific discipline, studying various aspects of communication or problems contiguous to communication, lay the emphasis on a particular subject of study. Sociology studies the functional properties of communication in different social groups representing their interaction transmission and reception of semantic and evaluative information to operate on this interaction, as well as on attitude towards social values within certain communities and society as a whole. Economic, social, political and other interests determine communication as process of interaction of subjects. Likewise, sociology studies the interaction of social and communicative factors in interpersonal, intragroup, and mass communication, as well as levelS of communication, types of communication systems, their units and categories, particular functions of social communication. Rif-a sociologist, it is important to study communication as a socially determined process subject to formation of individual and/or group patterns of verbal behavior. On the basis of mutual understanding in this interacting process a set of activities and arrangements is to be defined to ensure achievement of communicative purposes. Sociology of communication, along with interpersonal and intragroup communication, is a comprehensive study of mass communication, as it explores social factors contributing to the influence of mass media on public opinion. The object of the Sociology of communication is social communication. Changing trends in science created the need for an independent discipline, a system of knowledge about communication. The science Connmunicology by its disciplinary organization is a system of disciplines with rationales to their possible interconnections. In it a discipline of sociology sociology of communication stands to integrate theoretical and applied sociological research in the field of social communications. Cornmunicology as a whole is designed to consolidate a variety of theoretical systems, in one way or another related to communication issues.

DT Article
DE law; constitutional justice; constitutional court legislation;
   verification of constitutionality of presidential decrees; dispute
   matters in the constitutional court
AB The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation (CC), planned as the flagship of the judicial system, emerged in the years of perestroika - for the first time in Russian history. The article displays the process of the advanced concept of judicial reform and model of CC passing through the sieve of law-making process and political obstacles. The prototype of CC, the USSR Constitutional Supervision Committee, possessed neither the authority of power, nor the power of authority, proved to be helpless in the collapsing Soviet Union and quit the stage along with the parliament. Analysis of the successive constitutional projects of 1990-1993 and comparison of the two laws on the CC (one of them adopted before, the other after the adoption of the 1993 Constitution), shows how the legislator gradually retreated under the pressure of the forces who sought to limit the role and functions of the CC in the political and legal system of the state. After that, incorporation of the CC into the presidential "vertical" took place on the basis of the president's decrees and amendments to the law on CC made in 1995-2015. The Constitutional Court has to constantly make a choice between law and politics. Originally it tried to develop an intermediate position (the CPSU case in 1992), then actively interfered in the political process, supporting one of the parties to the conflict (the events of October 1993). The activity of the CC was suspended by the president and resumed under a new law in 1995. After that, when addressing dispute matters, the CC took, as a rule, the president's side (the presidential decrees on Chechnya, 1993-1994, the abolition of popular elections of governors in 2005, the right to ignore the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, 2015). Existence of the body of constitutional justice is important for the future of the country; however, its role in cases which involve human rights and freedoms of political matters remains modest or negative. It is essential that the Constitutional Court is given back its place in the state system that would meet the letter and spirit of the Constitution.

AB The most recent and effective method to resolve a conflict between countries is information war. Information warfare, i.e. propaganda, information sabotage, blackmail, could be more damaging than the effects of the traditional methods of war. The government must be prepared to prevent and counteract the bleeding-edge techniques of warfare that is to work out measures, to oppose enemy's information weapons, to gain information superiority, to develop a society that is immune to disinformation, to elaborate a concept of information warfare counteraction.
   The authors have examined both foreign and Russian sources of law which define the requirements for the government activities to oppose information warfare. They also refer to the opinions of foreign and Russian researchers, politicians and public figures who have commented on the concept and features of such political and legal constructs as information warfare and information weapons. The problem of information warfare must be identified as a profoundly serious and damaging threat. This paper provides the features of information warfare and the methods to resist it as well as the proposals to amend the domestic legislation to create conditions for an accurate understanding of this political and legal phenomenon. In addition, it points out that the amendment of the Information Security Doctrine is not sufficient to counterbalance the threat of information warfare. In a certain document it is necessary to recount all notions, requirements and methods for the government actions aimed to gradually change the situation, particularly, the development of sectoral (information security) legislation, specialists training to be able to deal with informational and psychological aggression forming public opinion through the government-run mass media, etc.

AB At the current stage of development of post-industrial society and world economy, the processes of globalization and specialization of national markets significantly enhance the competition between countries, regions as well as individual producers within a country. Against this background the governmental authorities of the Russian Federation, while preserving the country's global leadership in the energy sector, recognize the competitive economy and high-tech solutions as the long-term development strategy for the country.
   Following this line of policy, in the period between 2012 and 2014, Russian regions implemented cluster policy based on the federal and regional innovative development strategies. Among pilot cluster projects financed by the federal budget is the territorial cluster "Pharmaceutics, Medical Equipment and Information Technologies" formed in Tomsk Region that has unique starting opportunities for the formation of the stable innovative regional system, i.e., it has a developed scientific and educational complex as well as small and medium-size innovation enterprises with their state-of-the-art technological solutions in pharmaceutics and medical equipment.
   Two years of the Cluster's activity, with financial support from governmental authorities, were acknowledged as successful. In the long term, plans it is intended to expand both the range of pharmaceutical products and cooperation with other Tomsk clusters.

DE Non-linear model of higher education; massive open online courses
AB Non-linear challenges of the modernity are complex, and they influence the higher education system through economic, socio-cultural and political processes. They create global risks at social macrolevel, and higher education has to react on them by changing the structure of an educational space, establishing new inner and between-institutional social networks. Non-linear challenges affect social practices of all subjects in higher education system at a micro-level, and the result of their activity is unpredictable.
   Russian model of higher education, which has a rigid hierarchical and authoritarian system of management, is linear. It is an inefficient, does not meet the demands of modern development. It is necessary to create a more flexible model based on the principles of democracy, focused on the accounting needs of a variety of subjects (mainly students and teachers) and structures (different types of high schools) education, creating conditions for their multi-pronged development in each region and Russia as a whole.
   The aim of article is to research massive open online courses (MOOCs) as a non-linear form of the educational development, and how the Russian students are prepared to use this educational practice. The object of research is massive open online courses as non-linear aspect of the higher education development.
   To study the complex of methods was used. Firstly, the method of expert evaluations. Experts were rectors and vice-rectors of universities, deans, professors, representatives of the business elite, interact with higher education (30 experts). Secondly, we used online questionnaires covering lecturers and researchers from Russian universities (364 people). Thirdly, we conducted polls among students, looking into young peoples' readiness to implement networking in the form of MOOCs. We asked 1st and 2nd year students of the Ural Federal University with specialization in natural sciences and humanities. Poll was conducted in three stages using a complex method (home-test): 1. Preliminary questionnaires; 2. Individual work of respondents with MOOCs platforms; 3. Semi-formalized interview (414 people).
   Open distance technology of MOOCs meets the educational needs of wide audiences and appears to be one of the instruments of establishing the socio-professional structure of society. That technology satisfy the needs of professional intellectuals, people with high and executed learning motivation.
   Russian high school doesn't notice MOOCs new educational environment and doesn't consider it to be an educational subsystem. Students of Ural Federal university are not aware about online courses (51,6%), 40,5% "heard something about it", 1,6% searched for information about MOOCs, and 6,3% had an experience of online distance learning. Nowadays there is a need for theoretical investigation and innovation approaches to non-linear education, which is facing new challenges: identifying ways to open education development in its mass or exclusive/individual forms, finding new directions of MOOCs evolution and its optimal combination with formal education, first of all, with higher education. These problems should be investigated close to the everyday practices in all spheres of human activity to reveal the architecture of the education in future.

DT Article
DE music; counterculture; identity; diaspora; representation; postcolonial
   theory; subaltern studies; cultural studies
AB This article considers the problem of self-expression of the subaltern (those who are in a subordinate position in the power hierarchy) and their resistance to the existing order through making music. The topic is addressed in the context of black pop music, which was formed as a result of intensive cultural exchange in the Atlantic. Reflection on experiences of discrimination and the search for alternatives to (Eurocentric) forms of imagination, communication, and political action are constitutive elements of black music. Paul Gilroy, Professor at King's College London, identifies this alternative as the "counterculture of modernity." He uses this definition in his book "The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Conciseness," which is dedicated to the phenomenon of black culture and the role of music in it. This study verifies the key points suggested by Gilroy in his book, and considers a vast array of examples of musical practice.
   The first part of the article is devoted to a particular form of identity that appears most clearly in musical communication. Black music arises from the collision of different cultural streams in the Atlantic area. It exists in a tension between nomadism and rootedness. For this reason, any attempts to nationalize musical styles (as any other essentialist approaches to their adherents' identities) seem misleading. At the same time, the rituals of "black music" formed in a context of resistance to colonial power, which explains the coherence of their participants' self-awareness. The second part of the article describes various social practices, always accompanied by music, which embody certain types of otherness. Participants of such practices consciously put on the mask of the Other, who is the subject of discrimination. Finally, the third part of the article considers the problem of unequal access to resources of representation in the context of demand for authenticity on " world music" markets.

AB The Russian social sciences for many years held the scientific debate on the problems of the middle class. The middle class in Russia today is it a reality or a theoretical construct? At the heart of these contradictions are specialized narrow views on the issue. The article deals with the genesis of the middle class and its contents. It is proved that this social phenomenon is the integrity and should be read in conjunction of all its constituent elements social, economic, political, psychological, moral and ethical.

DT Article
DE modernization; traditionalism; revivalism; fundamentalism; archaization;
   reformation; globalization; sovereignty; nationalism; chauvinism;
   development; equality
AB Archaization in ideology and politics is not of an unambiguous meaning. That is unexpectedly demonstrated by India which since 1947 has been well known as strongly committed to secularism. The policy pursued by the new Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the one hand, is marked by remarkably manifested archaism. This is evident by his rhetoric and methods used (Yatra, panchamrut, slogans like "Bharat Mata Ki Jai", etc.); by the struggle against the KHAM program, resulting in increasing inter-religious and inter-caste tension accompanied by bloody pogroms. On the other hand, the course on "Development" taken by N. Modi at the cost of the course on "Equality", previously conducted by the ruling party Indian National Congress, demonstrates impressive successes. Archaism manifests not as an end in itself but as a force which mobilizes for modernization without loss of national identity. The expected results may be both positive (spurt in growth and joining the vanguard of world economic powers) and negative (economic growth reached by the establishment of the dictatorial regime, based on Hindu nationalism). Archaisation of the contemporary socio-political space is caused simultaneously by internal political reasons and by the crisis of a globalist model of modernization. The search for national models of modernization makes appeal to antiquity. Ideological archaism performing as a mobilizing force (as it has been seen in Gandhism) is not always positive. The opposite effect - is often observed: warming up of nationalist passions up to extreme chauvinism (Nazism, terrorist Islamism). Archaism in politics leads to the assertion of dictatorial regimes. Archaism in economics may become a serious obstacle to the introduction of new production methods and technologies. Hence there is an urgent necessity of the united efforts so that through intercultural discourse to come to intercultural philosophy of globalization which could cover the past, present and future of the planet.

ID CONSTRUCTION
AB In this article we highlight the problem of determining the optimal level of investments directed into the science and education field at the ratio required to ensure the sustainable development of regional economic systems. The main attention is paid to the analysis of financial flows in the Russian economy, aimed at the research and development (R&D). In our work we identified and explained the dynamics of investment flows in R&D and highlighted the main causes of the financial flows variable dynamics directed to the high-tech industry. Over the past decade, Russia has been reduced the number of personnel engaged in scientific fields. At the same time an increase of investment flows in the high-tech industry occurred. To adjust and increase the impact of investment flows science-based projections are required. To solve this problem we developed an proportional growth model in which the dynamics of capital and labour meets the proportionality conditions. Proportionality conditions of economic growth in this model are obtained by solving the output maximization problem under fixed costs at each time period. Investments directed into labour resources serve as control parameters and are intended to maintain the balanced development of economic systems. In this paper, we define the proportion between capital and labour resources and combine them through the price formation mechanism. The price formation mechanism is described by a combination of Coumot duopoly model and the Cobb Douglas production function. Solutions of the first level of optimization are aggregated in proportion to the overall cost of labour and then transferred to the upper level of optimization. The model is resulted in the system of nonlinear differential equations whose stationary points generate the steady state of the economics.

DE migration policy; integration policy; migrants rights; cultural
   assimilation
AB This paper deals with contradictions and challenges of Russian integration policy of the 2010s. Its implementation is complicated by an unfavorable xenophobic environment, highly politicized migration agenda and widespread institutional corruption. Moreover, the analysis of Russian integration policy based on legal documents and their implementation shows that integration in Russia is understood primarily as cultural assimilation. This view is in sharp contrast with modern European academic and legal approaches where the issues of cultural variety and structural integration focusing on migrants rights are prevalent. However, there is a tendency in contemporary Russia to extend the rights for many categories of migrants, albeit this process is unrelated to the integration policy. The author argues that despite some diversification and liberalization of the current migration policy Russia faces significant external and internal challenges in order to develop an effective agenda providing for the integration of migrants.

Contemporary Spanish society faces a problem of political renewal - both in terms of party-political structure and in terms of the constitutional and legal basis of the whole system. Authors present a complex definition of the crisis as a phenomenon of political life and discuss the concept of the political stability in terms of actual practice conditions - including the realities of Spanish society. Various components of contemporary Spanish instability (the parties' crisis, the lack of a strategic economic vector, the problems of identity and regional policy) strictly connects to the sharp conservative belief of political actors in the constitutional grounds of the Spanish state and the Moncloa Pact behind these base.

DE history of concepts; history of public thought; history of Russia in the
   first quarter of the 19th century; problem-comparative analysis;
   comparative contextual analysis; concept of "freedom"
AB The paper presents a brief analysis of the main provisions of the Anglo-Saxon and German ("Begriffsgeschichte") direction of modern methodology called the history of concepts. Based on it, the research model of studying history of social thought in Russia of the late 18th - early 19th centuries is presented. The history of concepts is considered as a special method of work with historical sources allowing to reconstruct evolution of public consciousness and the related changes in political, social, economic, and spiritual spheres. The basis of a research is made by the two complexes of historical sources: 1) the texts created in public communication (laws, textbooks, magazines, and dictionaries); 2) nonpublic texts addressed to certain personnel (personal letters, projects, reports, applications). The author compares the main and additional connotations of the concept of "freedom" used by the Russian authors of the first third of the 19th century to address the most pressing issues of intra- and interclass interactions. The comparative analysis of historical sources shows that the concept of "freedom" was not an abstract category, had a relationship with the Russian reality and was used to achieve particularly utilitarian purposes. But the desire to extend the limits of personal or group freedom did not mean aiming at its achievement in all possible ways. Most Russian citizens expected talent of freedom from representatives of local authorities or the sovereign.

DE Hegel; Walter Benjamin; Owl of Minerva; Angel of History; happiness;
   revolution; dialectics
AB In Hegel's philosophical system, the owl of Minerva is not just a metaphor, but a significant symbol. In the symbolism of Hegel's time, it stood for ideas of enlightenment and political emancipation, including radical, revolutionary, cosmopolitan, anti-monarchical, and even anarchistic ideas. Hegel, however, places the owl in a context that appears utterly un-revolutionary. "The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of dusk," he writes in the preface to the Philosophy of Right, thus summing up his argument that philosophy's task is not to teach the world how it ought to be, nor to issue instructions to the state, but rather to comprehend the world as reasonable.
   Not only does Hegel's owl seem to defend the reactionary present state ( a state against which she previously fought in the name of reason and freedom), but she also seems to teach us to accept the present with joy. The point is not merely to reconcile oneself with reality, but also to enjoy it. This paper traces a number of explanatory trajectories-philosophical, psychological, and anthropological-in order to elucidate the paradoxical nature of this enjoyment, and compares the figure of Minerva's owl with another flying creature, Walter Benjamin's Angel of History. Such a comparison aims to pave the way towards a new interpretation of Hegel's philosophy of history and time.

In his works, the idea of nation is presented as the main basis for the accordance within the state. On other hand, that idea entails the endeavor to separate institutionally own state from other states. The answer to the question, whether Weber would have approved impending National Socialism if he had lived longer, is absent in the article. At the same time, his decisive distancing from social Darwinism, anti-Semitism and national chauvinism testifies against such assumption.

DE innovation potential; high school; method of estimation of innovative
   potential
AB Systematic approach to the concept of the innovation potential of higher eduction; Offered the method for quantitative assessment of the innovation potential of higher education as a complex category, characterized by a system of interrelated indicators reflecting the results of higher education and the resources available in the interaction with the external environment.
   In modern conditions of stable macroeconomic development of any system is only possible on the basis of effective innovation. The innovative development of the economy makes significant changes in all spheres of activity, which are carried out innovation, including in higher education. The effectiveness of the implementation of the development strategy of high school, based on knowledge and a sharp increase in the rate of technological progress depends on the level of its innovation potential. Despite the large number of publications devoted to the problems of innovative development of the higher school, the mechanisms of implementation of the innovation potential of higher education institutions has not been fully investigated and have no conceptual framework. Currently, among the researchers, there is no common understanding of its essence, structure and methods of assessment. The concept of "innovation potential" have been developed since the early 1980s and was a reflection of innovation. In some cases, the potential for innovation is identified with science and technology, and presented as "accumulated a certain amount of information on the results of scientific and technical works, inventions, design development of new equipment and production" [1, p. 29]. In addition to this defmition of innovation potential, there are a number of others. Table 1 presents some approaches to the definition of "innovative potential. "

DE scientific policy; Saudi Arabia; international scientific cooperation;
   scientific and research institutes; scientific and technical development
AB In less than a century of its existence Saudi Arabia has developed from mass illiteracy and lack of education of its population into the current state of complex structure of educational and research institutions and organizations equipped with most modern and advanced technologies and top world specialists in accordance with the highest international standards. It is especially important that the Kingdom has managed to achieve such success in no time. Until lately scientific development in Saudi Arabia was mostly concentrated on applied research, especially in the Kingdom's key economic sphere - energy. Despite the country's abundant financial resources, science was considerably underfunded and lacked any development strategy. Meanwhile, in the last 15 years the Saudi Kingdom has made a huge leap in scientific development with a clear action plan worked out, a solid structure of scientific institutes formed and the world experience efficiently used. The success came with the Saudi authorities' realization of the importance of scientific and technical progress both for the national economy and political positions of the state in the region and in the world. The article aims to analyze the scientific policy of Saudi Arabia on the stage of its birth and in the current state by means of studying official documents, statistics and the existing institutes in the scientific system of the Kingdom. The author concludes that the key features of the Saudi scientific policy are prevailing role of the state, priority of applied over fundamental research and internalization with serious dependency on foreign support in the absence of a national scientific tradition.

AB The development and implementation of science intensive, converging and innovative technologies are of key importance for the Russian Federation due to a number of reasons: high international competition, economic instability, complex social and political processes, rapid modernization, etc. To ensure the effective development of technological potential it is necessary to upgrade a number of industries, but the effectiveness of institutional interaction is even more important: by increasing the professional competence of innovations developers, by investing in new technologies, and by improving business environment only one problem is usually solved, but the positive results are often reduced because of the general weakness of institutional cooperation. To solve this problem we should take into account factors affecting the creation and commercialization of technologies. One of the most important but not always taken into account factor is the legal protection of the intellectual property, i.e. the implementation of patent legislation, which influences innovation processes and determines the inventive activity in the country. However, institutional cooperation within the patent law is still largely ignored in the scientific and business literature. Thus, the authors aim to describe the features of intellectual property protection in the form of patent law, and to study the problems and prospects of the institutional interaction between the key stakeholders of the patent law in the Russian Federation with the help of expert interviews. The research allowed the authors to identify the main problems of the patent law and the ways to overcome negative trends in the protection of intellectual property.

DE social protest; abrechestvo; popular uprisings; First Russian revolution

AB The article is devoted to the protest movement in the North Caucasus in second half of XIX - the beginning of XX centuries. The article is the first of planned by authors cycle of articles about the protest movement in the North Caucasus during the second half of the XIX century to early XXI century. The article based on analysis of published and archival evidence highlighted the reasons for the uprisings, and their character and significance. The frame of archival material were documents of central state archive of Kabardino-Balkarian Republic and the Archive of the Kabardino-Balkarian Institute of humanitarian researches. The main catalysts for the protests on the southern outskirts of the Russian Empire were the inertia of the Caucasian war, the large-scale legal and administrative innovations, unreasonable actions of the crown authorities. The article describes the largest rebellion of the highlanders in this period, which allows us to trace the peculiarities of the various stages of the protest movement in the North Caucasus. The insurrections of the 1860s became the reaction of traditional mountain societies on the Imperial upgrades.
   The indignation of the indigenous population caused the increase of taxes, which threatened completely to upset the already undermined by years of war economy of highlanders. The forced resettlement of highlanders to the plains by the Russian authorities pushed the mountaineers to the rebellion. The role of a fuse played the numerous rumors about the impending mass baptism of the highlanders and turn them into Cossacks. But the most important that the indigenous population did not trust the Russian legal and administrative institutions, did not believe in their fairness and impartiality. The uprising of 1877 was the last attempt to stop the spread of Russian sovereignty in the North Caucasus. The uprising tried to copy the state structure of the Imamate of Shamil, to restore the old titles and forms of government but it has not had much success. The pre-revolutionary period is associated with a system of political and administrative crisis of the Empire and the evolution of abrechestva, which has led to the emergence of the phenomenon of "professional robbery" in the Caucasus.

TI REPRESENTATIONS OF WORKERS IN RUSSIAN PRINT MEDIA
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY STUDIES
LA Russian
DT Article
DE representations of workers; print media; critical discourse analysis;
   Russia
AB This paper focuses on how industrial workers are represented in popular Russian print media that is aimed at a mass audience. The authors consider the kind of media discourses active in characterizing workers today. To examine this, the critical discourse analysis elaborated by Norman Fairclough was applied, which entails the considering the discourses with the help of a three-dimensional scheme: this includes the levels of social context, discursive practice and text. Based on interviews with journalists, copy editors and contributors to media publications, definite conservative and liberal discursive types emerge that categorize "industrial workers" as a social group. The conservative discourse constitutes corporate and traditional values. It creates a normative image of a worker as part of a larger organism, e.g. a factory, enterprise, corporation or civilization. The conservative discourse represents worker protests as being heavily influenced by external forces and there is a tendency to merge workers into the same group as shop stewards, managers and other socio-professional groups taking higher social positions. The liberal discourse promotes ideas of freedom and economic values and can be divided into neoliberal and liberal-social discursive subtypes. The neoliberal discourse intensifies social inequality and describes workers through the categories of "global capital", "world economy" and quantitative indicators; it characterizes them as a necessary element of Russian society, which should earn profit for the ruling class and be "effective". On the contrary, the liberal-social discourse pays attention to questions of social justice and labour conflicts. This discursive subtype represents workers as active, energetic and decisive people who are able to act independently and collectively, asserting their rights and freedoms. In this context liberal-social discourse conflicts with the conservative one. The authors argue that hybrid discourses circulate in the contemporary medialandscape, which contradict or coexist peacefully with each other in relation to the representations of workers. The authors conclude that the conservative discursive type uses workers to legitimatise the current political order. On the other hand, the neoliberal discourse describes workers as an economic resource, while liberal-social discourse focuses on the social problems of workers but does it for the purposes of attracting the attention of readers and enlarging the size of its readership.

DE nationalism; political party; ideology; empirical research; political

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the data obtained through the mass questionnaire survey of residents of the Saratov region in 2015. The authors found the perception of nationalism by citizens, the link between political views of the respondents, and their political engagement, and political participation, as well as the influence of political parties on the expression of nationalist feelings in society.
   Special attention is paid to the spread of nationalist attitudes among different population groups in connection with: the negative attitude of some foreign countries to the actions of Russia in Ukraine and the reunification of the Crimea with Russia; with the aggravation of the economic crisis, the sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States that led to such consequence as a decrease in the standard of living of the majority of Russian citizens; with the continuing influx of migrants, which increases the likelihood of xenophobia and radicalism.
   The authors conclude that in the minds of Russian citizens the ambiguous interpretation of nationalism dominates. On the one hand, nationalism is interpreted as a negative and dangerous phenomenon associated with the superiority of one ethnic group over the others. On the other hand, it is understood as the strengthening of state nationalism, largely defined by the patriotic feelings of love for their country in a globalized world, the desire to reduce the sovereignty, Russia's active position in the fight against ISIL. There is a trend of decrease of ethnic nationalist and xenophobic attitudes in the face of external challenges and threats. However, this does not mean conscious establishment of the values of tolerance in the political culture of those groups of Russians who tend to manifest xenophobia. In this case there is a situational transferring of one's rejection of the "other" to the external environment.

AB The article reconstructs the regime of military c-aptivity used in Russia to the enemy servicemen during the Seven Years' War. According to the author, this regime differed serious specifics, determined by two interrelated and interdependent characteristics of the Prussian Army: first, multinational structure, including the subjects of different European states, in particular neutral and even allied for Petersburg, and secondly, an extremely high level of desertion from its ranks, mainly in the forms of individual and group transition-to the enemy. The author reveals the unique order of differentiation of the Prussian prisoner in the Russia; analyzes the differences in the management of their contingent from the management of prisoners in times of wars between Russia and Sweden (1741-1743 and 1787-1791) and between Russia and Turkey (1735-1739 and 1768-1774); concludes that the experience of the development of the national system of military captivity, received at the turn of the 50s 60s)(VIII century, could be used by the Russian military and political leadership during the subsequent armed conflict, especially during the Patriotic War of 1812 and the both World Wars.

ID LAWYERS; RUSSIA; STATE; MOVEMENT; VIOLENCE; RIGHTS
AB The present paper reviews the activity of professional organizations of advocates as a factor of transfer from limited access order to open access order, in terms of the theory of North, Wallis and Weingast. Using the analysis of the experience of advocates' collective action in developing countries, the paper proposes a model explaining the process of mobilization of the legal community for countering the violations of the law by the ruling elite. It shows that collective action of advocates plays a significant role in implementing the principles of rule of law. However, the efficiency of such collective action in a particular country depends on the institutional capacity of its legal association (in terms of Doner & Schneider (2000)) and on the position of the professional elite that is heading it. The elite of the advocates' community in developing countries is confronted by a difficult choice between identifying itself with the national political elite and the need to respond to the demand of grass-roots members of the profession regularly encountering violations of the law by representatives of the authorities. On the example of various countries, we show, how the choice of professional elite leads to different scenarios, and make conclusions for the situation in Russia.

AB This paper reports results from comparative study of master students' patterns across two trajectories of future specialization. Using thematic analysis we identified students' patterns of different groups of students. First group of patterns (or early life-course strategies) were identified from the sample of students from political department, second group of patterns were identified from the sample of students from natural science (chemistry) department (N=40). Students' patterns are kind of markers that characterized various situations and scarcities of such situations in different type of labor market and different branch of science where they are studying. Based on the hypotheses of relative scarcity that underlie individual behavior we recognized different patterns and models of the initial patterns across data set. We found two explicit patterns, but with varied diversity of each. Fist identified pattern was "safety pattern", second was "development pattern". Students from different departments demonstrate different patterns, in some cases quite opposite. We found and describe critical cases within patterns.

DT Book Review
DE debt; gift exchange; money; market; state; financial crisis; moral
   economy
AB David Graeber's Debt is certainly among the most prominent social science books of the last decade. It undertakes a careful analysis of the nature of debt and suggests a new vision of a number of economic and political phenomena - money, exchange, market, state. The research is particularly interesting for shedding a light on the moral foundations of economic behavior. Graeber studies the moral dimension of markets and develops a powerful tool for concrete analysis of contemporary economy in its relation to power, inequality, and international politics. The book takes for its main objective an explanation of why we tend to believe that 'one has to pay one's debts' regardless of circumstances. A historical-anthropological investigation demonstrates that money debts are closely linked to both expansion of markets and strengthening of states. The book is addressed to a wide audience; however, it is also a highly valuable source for anthropologists, sociologists, historians and political philosophers.
   In the published book review, G. Yudin continues to discuss Graeber's monograph. 1 He unfolds the key ideas, demonstrates their contributions to research discussions on moral economy, and indicates the strengths and weaknesses of the Russian translation.

DE Yakutia; Russian Orthodox Church; integration; dialogue among

AB The article discusses the beginning of the integration process of newly received, the suburban areas of the Russian state on the example of the Russian Orthodox Church activities in Yakutia in the middle of XVII - the beginning of XVIII centuries, when this territory in the church and administrative respect was subordinate to the bishops of Tobolsk archdiocese - "the Tobolsk period". The spread of Orthodoxy in the outlying territories was, first of all, a part of state policy of the Russian Empire, the way of integration into the Russian state system. Simultaneously with the registration of the administrative-territorial structure of new lands there was the formation of the structures of the Russian Orthodox Church. This article describes the attempts of creation of individual dioceses on the territory of the archdiocese, some information about the Yakut clergymen and number of "monarchic people" in Yakut area, notes the facts of receiving all types of government salaries by spiritual persons of Yakutia, identifies the main reasons for acceptance of a christening by the local population and the dependence of rate of the Christianization on the state regional policy, a priority of which in the middle of XVII - the beginning of XVIII centuries was the incoming of tribute paid off in furs. The growth of the Russian state, inclusion a new citizens in its structure caused cardinal changes in life of the conjoint people which has to interact with new to them political and economic system, coming to submission of the Russian administration. During research, interest of the government in distribution of Orthodoxy that found reflection in the orders which were given to local magistrates is revealed. It is obvious, that during the studied period there was a caution in christening questions when each case was considered by administration without the opinion of clergy. We have found that in the second half of XVII - the beginning of XVIII centuries the Yakut clergy was not numerous, geographically remote from the center and served, in common, the spiritual needs of the Russian population, concentrated in ostrogs, outposts and peasant settlements. It is noted, that the state policy was not directed on extermination of the indigenous people, did not lead to a breach of their way of life and economic structure. The attention is paid to the discussion character of the matter of releasing the neophytes from tribute. The author makes the conclusion that experience of studying history of church in Yakutia gives the opportunity of expansion of scientific idea of integration of the remote regions of the empire into implementation of nation-wide, all-imperial tasks on the ways of loyalty and solidarity with the main values of mentality of the indigenous people on these territories.
