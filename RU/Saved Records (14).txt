TI Why Resource-poor Dictators Allow Freer Media: A Theory and Evidence
   from Panel Data
SO AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English

AB Every dictator dislikes free media. Yet, many nondemocratic countries have partially free or almost free media. In. this article, we develop a theory of media freedom in dictatorships and provide systematic statistical evidence in support of this theory. In our model, free media allow a dictator to provide incentives to bureaucrats and therefore to improve the quality of government. The importance of this benefit varies with the natural resource endowment. In resource-rich countries, bureaucratic incentives are less important for the dictator; hence, media freedom is less likely to emerge. Using panel data, we show that controlling for country fixed effects, media are less free in oil-rich economies, with the effect especially pronounced in nondemocratic regimes. These results are robust to model specification and the inclusion of various controls, including the level of economic development, democracy, country size, size of government, and others.

AB To what extent do migrants carry their culture with them, and to what extent do they acquire the culture of their new home? The answer not only has important political implications; it also helps us understand the extent to which basic cultural values are enduring or malleable, and whether cultural values are traits of individuals or are attributes of a given society. The first part of this article considers theories about the impact of growing social diversity in Western nations. We classify two categories of society: Origins (defined as Islamic Countries of Origin for Muslim migrants, including twenty nations with plurality Muslim populations) and Destinations (defined as Western Countries of Destination for Muslim migrants, including 22 OECD member states with Protestant or Roman Catholic majority populations). Using this framework, we demonstrate that, on average, the basic social values of Muslim migrants fall roughly midway between those prevailing in their country of origin and their country of destination. We conclude that Muslim migrants do not move to Western countries with rigidly fixed attitudes; instead, they gradually absorb much of the host culture, as assimilation theories suggest.

AB The view of identities as always situated in a relationship with the Other underlies contemporary constructivist social theory. Taking a step further, and combining constructivist approaches to identity with insights from post-colonial studies, this article argues that the Other, far from being a mere presence, often plays an active role in identity politics. By tracing the historically varying ways in which Turkey and Russia have engaged in European identity construction, it demonstrates that this is an interactive process of negotiation between the European Self and its external Others in which agency of the Other is revealed. In particular, Russia and Turkey exercise agency by challenging, each in its own manner, the EU's power to define the normative meaning of Europe. While Turkey has contributed to a decentring of European identity by challenging the self-perception of Europe as a multicultural space, Russia's uncompromising stance tends to consolidate the EU-centred image of Europe as a political community based on liberal democratic values.

ID DISCRIMINATION; PREJUDICE; SOCIETY
AB The willingness to trust strangers has been associated with a variety of public benefits, from greater civic-mindedness and more honest government to higher rates of economic growth, and more. But a growing body of research finds that such generalized trust is far more common in ethnically homogeneous than in more diverse societies. Ethnic difference is believed to breed more particularistic, ingroup ties, thus undermining both generalized and cross-ethnic trust. We argue that this image is too narrow, and we propose a broader model to identify the factors that give rise to cross-ethnic trust. Using data from two minority regions of Russia, we find considerable support for the model. We also find that high ingroup or particularistic trust is no barrier to faith in another ethnic group.

ID RUSSIA; MODEL; GOVERNMENT; POLITICS; POLICY
AB Why and when do businessmen run for public office rather than rely upon other means of influence? What are the implications of their participation for public policy? We show formally that "businessman candidacy" and public policy are jointly determined by the institutional environment. When institutions that hold elected officials accountable to voters are strong, businessmen receive little preferential treatment and are disinclined to run for office. When such institutions are weak, businessmen can subvert policy irrespective of whether they hold office, but they may run for office to avoid the cost of lobbying elected officials. Evidence from Russian gubernatorial elections supports the model's predictions. Businessman candidates emerge in regions with low media freedom and government transparency, institutions that raise the cost of reneging on campaign promises. Among regions with weaker institutions, professional politicians crowd out businessmen when the rents from office are especially large.

TI Emancipative Values and Non-Violent Protest: The Importance of
   'Ecological' Effects
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID COLLECTIVE ACTION; POSTMATERIALISM
AB This article examines the impact of values on a key phenomenon of modern politics: non-violent protest. Previous studies have examined only the individual-level effects of values. Studying in addition the 'ecological' effects - how the social prevalence of values affects protest - generates new insights. Focusing on 'emancipative values', two ecological effects are shown: (1) the prevalence of emancipative values lifts people's protest above the level that their own emancipative values suggest (elevator effect); (2) the prevalence of these values enhances the impact of people's own emancipative values on protest (amplifier effect). We conclude that examining values in models of protest (and possibly of other activities), not only as individual attributes but also as ecological properties, gives 'culture' its full weight in explaining behaviour.

ID MODEL
AB In dynamic collective decision making, current decisions determine the future distribution of political power and influence future decisions. We develop a general framework to study this class of problems. Under acyclicity, we characterize dynamically stable states as functions of the initial state and obtain two general insights. First, a social arrangement is made stable by the instability of alternative arrangements that are preferred by sufficiently powerful groups. Second, efficiency-enhancing changes may be resisted because of further changes they will engender. We use this framework to analyze dynamics of political rights in a society with different types of extremist views. (JEL D71, D72, K10)

AB Media freedom strongly inhibits corruption and promotes good governance, but what leads to media freedom? Do economic development and higher advertising revenues tend to make media outlets independent of political groups' influence? Using data on nineteenth-century American newspapers, I show that places with higher advertising revenues were likelier to have newspapers that were independent of political parties. Similar results hold when local advertising rates are instrumented by regulations on outdoor advertising and newspaper distribution. In addition, newly created newspapers were more likely to enter the market as independents in places with higher advertising rates. I also exploit the precise timing of major changes in advertising rates to identify how advertising revenues affected the entry of new newspapers. Finally, I demonstrate that economic development, and concomitant higher advertising revenue, is not the only reason that an independent press expands; political factors also played a role.

AB Using survey data from 28 transition countries, we test for the complementarity and substitutability of market-relevant skills and institutions. We show that democracy and good governance complement market skills in transition economies. Under autocracy and weak governance institutions, there is no significant difference in support for revising privatization between high- and low-skilled respondents. As the level of democracy and the quality of governance increases, the difference in the level of support for revising privatization between the high and low skilled grows dramatically. This finding contributes to our understanding of microfoundations of the politics of economic reform.

SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
ID DEMOCRACY
AB The thesis that 'Asian' cultures oppose the 'Western' emphasis on emancipative values and liberal democracy has mostly been criticized for its political instrumentality. By contrast, the empirical claim about most Asians' dismissal of emancipative values and liberal democracy has not been tested on a broadly cross-cultural basis. Filling this gap, this article uses data from the World Values Surveys to put the values of Asian populations into global perspective. As a result, the differences between Asian and Western populations over emancipative values and liberal democracy appear to be gradual, not categorical. What is more, the forces of modernization that gave rise to emancipative values and a liberal notion of democracy in the 'West', are doing the same in the 'East', confirming a universal model of human development rather than Asian exceptionalism, or any other form of cultural exceptionalism.

ID IDENTITY
AB The slogan of 'sovereign democracy' forms the ideological horizon of contemporary Russia. While many scholars would warn against taking the official propaganda seriously, I choose to treat it as a symptom of the discursive tensions that exist both in the Russian identity politics and, more broadly, in the global debate about the future of democracy. Using a poststructuralist perspective, I explore the origins of the restorationist turn in Russian identity politics, which is currently obsessed with comparing the new Russia with the Soviet 'golden age' and struggles to adapt this neo-imperial identity to the unprecedented and utterly uncertain boundaries of the emerging political community. At the global level, the Kremlin attempts to redefine democracy as a truly universal value to be emancipated from western hegemonic control. I contend that, despite it being used to justify the most undemocratic practices at home, this criticism constitutes an extremely interesting departure with a great liberating potential. It indicates a significant degree of dislocation existing in both the Russian domestic and global hegemonic structures. Dislocation can provoke securitizing practices that lead back to a structural closure, but it can also provide foundations for emancipatory politics, if and when there is a subject willing to liberate itself.

Drawing on legislation, the press, and data about the backgrounds and career paths of the post-Soviet elite, the central institutions are compared with their Soviet predecessors and the implementation of this strategy is examined. The roles of military, security and other backgrounds are analyzed. The degree of influence likely to be wielded by the siloviki is also considered.

ID PUBLIC SCIENCE; BRITISH
AB The revolutionary transformation in Russian science toward the Soviet model of research started even before the revolution of 1917. It was triggered by the crisis of World War I, in response to which Russian academics proposed radical changes in the goals and infrastructure of the country's scientific effort. Their drafts envisioned the recognition of science as a profession separate from teaching, the creation of research institutes, and the turn toward practical, applied research linked to the military and industrial needs of the nation. The political revolution and especially the Bolshevik government that shared or appropriated many of the same views on science, helped these reforms materialize during the subsequent Civil War. By 1921, the foundation of a novel system of research and development became established, which in its most essential characteristics was similar to the U.S. later phenomenon known as "big science".

AB While many studies have examined the external dimensions of democratization, the role of external anti-democratic factors remains unaddressed. Using an original dataset to analyze the presence and impact of external anti-democratic factors, this article aims to untangle the international dimensions of regime transition by singling out foreign trade. International post-Soviet trade links' impact on subnational political regimes in Russia is analyzed. Trade links between post-Soviet states and their regions are longstanding, dating back to the Soviet or even the tsarist period. The authors hypothesize that this variable was an important factor in regime transition in Russia's regions. The findings have wider implications for area studies and theoretical studies of democratization and regime transition.

DT Article
DE business; elite; oligarchy; Russia
AB The early 1990s saw the formation of a new group of Russian property owners, often derivative of the late Soviet nomenklatura. The richest and most influential were known as oligarchs, and they established a dominant position in the later years of the Yeltsin presidency. Only 15% of the 1993 business elite still retained their position by 2001, after the 1998 devaluation of the currency. Those who took their place were younger, less metropolitan, better educated and more likely to have a background in government, including many who had enjoyed ministerial status. The new business elite is less personally ambitious, but its political influence is no less considerable and its representation in decision-making bodies has more than doubled over the post-communist period. The logic of development is towards a concentration of economic power in the hands of 20-25 large conglomerates in a politically subordinate association with government, along South Korean lines.

AB Post-Stalinist reforms resulted in dramatic changes in the ways of operation of Soviet science: one can say that they altered the very understanding of what science was, or should be, in the socialist society. A new vision came about as a result of political and rhetorical efforts of scientists, who pushed forward their various, often conflicting, agendas acting in accordance with specific rules of Soviet polity The most visible part of the reform came with the 1961 administrative reorganization of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The related series of changes, however, was much broader and comprehensive, modifying the relationships between science and ideology, politicians and academic researchers, and establishing the very division between fundamental and applied research, which had been strongly rejected during the preceding Stalinist period.

AB In an attempt to broaden our perspective on IR theory formation, this article seeks to highlight the significance of ideology. Consistent with the recently revived sociology of knowledge tradition in international studies, we view IR scholarship as grounded in certain social and ideological conditions. Although some scholars have studied the political, ideological, and epistemological biases of Western, particularly American, civilization, in order to achieve a better understanding of global patterns of knowledge formation it is important to look at cases beyond the West. We therefore look at the formation of IR knowledge in Russia, and we argue that the development of a Russian theory of international relations responds to the old debate on the 'Russian idea,' and three distinct ideological traditions that had been introduced to the national discourse in the mid-19th century. Focusing on theories and concepts of the international system, regional order, and foreign policy, as developed by Russian scholars, we attempt to demonstrate how they are shaped by ideological and therefore pre-theoretical assumptions about social reality.

ID RISK
AB This article considers the prospects for effective regulation of emerging globalized industries by examining the effectiveness of the 'smart regulation' approach associated with the port state control enforcement regime for seafarers' health and safety. Smart regulation seeks to generate incentive structures that promote proactive compliance by ship operators. Drawing on an international comparative study, which included extensive observation of ship inspections in India, Russia and the UK, it is suggested that the main reason why the hoped-for 'market in virtue' is only weakly present turns on the perceived and actual inconsistencies in the implementation of the regulatory regime. These contrasts exist cross-nationally, and are manifested in terms of differences in the local character of enforcement practice, and in levels of trust in national regulatory administrations. The strong overall regulatory framework, the political will to avoid damaging maritime accidents, and the well-developed system of port state control, all suggest that the shipping industry may be taken as a test case for the possibility of effective smart governance of a globalized industry. The limited gains achieved in this sector thus bode ill for effective future governance of other emerging globalizing industries.

AB Two noted political geographers examine the results of surveys in the "de facto" states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia conducted in 2010. They assess the migration intentions of their residents, the likely destinations and motivations for planned departures, as well as the dramatic population decline due to emigration and expulsion of Georgian residents after wars in the early 1990s. Discussed are economic dislocations, the breakaway republics' uncertain geographical status, as well as improvements in security and economic conditions due to Russian military guarantees and massive economic aid that followed the 2008 wars with Georgia. The authors utilize key predictors derived from hypotheses about the push and pull forces affecting the decision to migrate (sociodemographic, war experiences, and attitudes about the "de facto" state prospects) to develop explanatory models of migration for each territory before deriving a pooled set of explanations. Both surveys suggest the likelihood that the majority of potential migrants have already left.

ID ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; BLACKMAIL
AB Many conflicts and negotiations can be viewed as dynamic games in which parties have no commitment power. In our model, a potential aggressor demands concessions from a weaker party by threatening war. The absence of commitment makes a continuous stream of transfers a more effective appeasement strategy than a lump-sum transfer. As long as both sides have constant marginal utility of consumption, it is possible to construct a self-enforcing peace agreement even if transfers shift the balance of power. When marginal utility of consumption is decreasing, a self-enforcing peace agreement may not be feasible. The bargaining power of the potential aggressor increases dramatically if she is able to make probabilistic threats, for example, by taking an observable action that leads to war with a positive probability. This "brinkmanship strategy" allows a blackmailer to extract a positive stream of payments from the victim, even if carrying out the threat is harmful to both parties. Our results are applicable to environments ranging from diplomacy to negotiations within or among firms and are aimed to bring together "parallel" investigations in the nature of commitment in economics and political science.

AB My main thesis can be formulated as follows: accounts of the traumatic presence of the Soviet past in present-day Russia - descriptions that rely on analytical frameworks based in claims concerning the masses' post-Soviet nostalgia and the restoration efforts of the political powers-that-be, which supports and guides this nostalgia - are becoming less and less adequate to grasp the current situation. We are no longer dealing with nostalgia and the desire for a return of the lost object, but with a politics whose objective is the positive recoding of nostalgia for the Soviet past into a new form of Russian patriotism for which 'the Soviet' lacks any historical specificity, but is rather seen as part of a broadly conceived and comically heterogeneous cultural legacy. The consideration of this inner and intense connection between the Soviet past, nostalgia and the project of modernization of Russia includes revealing of main cultural tendencies (in reinterpretation and restoration of historical past) as well as discourse analysis of president Medvedev's speeches dedicated to the modernization project.

AB We propose three ideal types of business-state relations in a transition economy and explore the impact of government directors on corporate boards for firm behavior. Using a unique dataset of joint-stock companies in Russia, we find that the presence of government directors on corporate boards is more consistent with a "collusion" ideal type of relations between firms and the state than with a managerial discipline or rent-extraction ideal type. The state sends directors to firms that both extract resources from the state, but that also provide important benefits and services to the state. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper presents the outcomes of the expert group "The transition from fostering innovation to innovation-based growth" on adjusting the Strategy for socio economic development of Russia up to 2020. Panel experts have undertaken a detailed analysis of the state of art of the Russian innovation sphere and proposed recommendations on the choice of strategic priorities for state policy, as well as specific regulatory tools that can be implemented in the near future.
   Among the key challenges identified are: the increasing Russian dependence on foreign markets, the growing socioeconomic risks, difficulties with adequate responding to the rapidly changing global trends, significant gaps between the main actors of the innovation system, sufficient lack of access to new technologies and innovations for different social groups. The most significant positive trends include: the introduction of new regulatory tools, the gradual expansion of the actors players in the innovation sector and, the growth of public R&D funding.
   The experts propose three possible scenarios: the inertial scenario implies low rates of economic growth while preserving the dependence of the economy on extractive industries; the progressive scenario presumes the accelerated integration into global processes and transition to post industrial model and the moderate scenario which has the highest probability of realization. The implementation of a scenario depends on political choices made in the context of bifurcation in areas such as legislation, regulation, science, and many others. For example, in education there is a need to choose between "soft" adaptation of existing educational programs to meet the changing needs of the economy and greater emphasis on the development of specific professional skills.
   The paper formulates the basic directions of a prospective innovation policy: shifting from focusing on support for individual innovative projects that meet tight technology priorities to fostering mass innovation in all sectors of the economy, including low tech ones; sectoral differentiation of the priorities, criteria, policy instruments, balanced support for innovation in high- and low-tech sectors, the rejection of a rigid hierarchy in the governance in favor of decentralization, empowerment of regions, development institutions, business associations and other entities with more power; support for network cooperation at all levels, focusing on an output-oriented approach to decision making, ensuring the balance of thematic and functional priority policies in order to eliminate possible failures in the innovation cycle. The authors put emphasis on the social effects of innovation policy, the need for supporting the creative class as well as the training of entrepreneurs, managers and professionals for the innovation sector and the economy as a whole.

AB Reconciling indigenous bonding and bridging social capital remains a difficult issue in economic development and global issues of inequality. A failure to address this problem weakens the legitimacy of liberal democratic political institutions. Mancur Olson's Logic of Collective Action (1971) is used as the starting point to identify the structural properties of bridging social capital, and the broad parameters within which strategies for using indigenous social capital to create these properties may be found. Empirical examples from the authors' research are used to illustrate alternative ways and the costs and benefits of different strategies for linking indigenous bonding and bridging social capital.

AB The paper investigates the influence of outside options on the predatory behavior of autocrats. An outside option is referred to as the opportunity of an incumbent ruler to continue his career outside his current territory of control. The paper uses data on the effectiveness of tax collection and the repressiveness of tax jurisprudence for Russian regions in 20072009 and finds that regions ruled by governors with substantial outside options are characterized by more repressive behavior of tax authorities. However, surprisingly, the same tax authorities collect less additional revenues for the public budget. It conjectures that the presence of an outside option induces autocrats to behave like roving bandits: they use tax audits to establish control over regional companies, but exploit this control to extract private rents rather than revenues for the regional budget used for public goods provision.

AB Background: General psychiatric and forensic psychiatric beds, supported housing and the prison population have been suggested as indicators of institutionalized mental health care. According to the Penrose hypothesis, decreasing psychiatric bed numbers may lead to increasing prison populations. The study aimed to assess indicators of institutionalized mental health care in post-communist countries during the two decades following the political change, and to explore whether the data are consistent with the Penrose hypothesis in that historical context.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: General psychiatric and forensic psychiatric bed numbers, supported housing capacities and the prison population rates were collected in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Croatia, Czech Republic, East Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Russia and Slovenia. Percentage change of indicators over the decades 1989-1999, 1999-2009 and the whole period of 1989-2009 and correlations between changes of different indicators were calculated. Between 1989 and 2009, the number of general psychiatric beds was reduced in all countries. The decrease ranged from -11% in Croatia to -51% in East Germany. In 2009, the bed numbers per 100,000 population ranged from 44.7 in Azerbaijan to 134.4 in Latvia. Forensic psychiatric bed numbers and supported housing capacities increased in most countries. From 1989-2009, trends in the prison population ranged from a decrease of -58% in East Germany to an increase of 43% in Belarus and Poland. Trends in different indicators of institutionalised care did not show statistically significant associations.
   Conclusions/Significance: After the political changes in 1989, post-communist countries experienced a substantial reduction in general psychiatric hospital beds, which in some countries may have partly been compensated by an increase in supported housing capacities and more forensic psychiatric beds. Changes in the prison population are inconsistent. The findings do not support the Penrose hypothesis in that historical context as a general rule for most of the countries.

They emphasize the need to look beyond simple ethnic categories to understand the nature of local tensions and also propose that the profound nature of the post-Soviet upheavals has uprooted long-standing practices. The paper covers physical diversity, historical and administrative geopolitics, Stalinist deportations in the 1940s, and post-Soviet demographic and economic developments. An introduction to each of the five papers comprising the special issue follows the regional overview.

AB The possibility of crossing humans with other anthropoid species has been discussed in fiction as well as in scientific literature during the twentieth century. Professor Il'ya Ivanov's attempt to achieve this was crucial for the beginning of organized primate research in the Soviet Union, and remains one of the most interesting and controversial experiments that was ever done on non-human primates. The possibility of removing the boundary that separates humans from other animal species, apes in particular, is loaded with important political meaning and violates cultural and ethical taboos. The history of lvanov's scientific experiment thus helps to reveal some of the twentieth-century's important cultural conventions and hidden assumptions about human nature, species, and social hierarchy.

AB Soviet science in the post-WWII period was torn between two contradictory directives: to 'overtake and surpass' Western science. especially in defence-related fields; and to 'criticize and destroy' Western scholarship for its alleged ideological flaws. In response to this dilemma. Soviet scientists developed two opposite discursive strategies. While some scholars 'ideologized' science, translating scientific theories into a value-laden political language. others tried to 'de-ideologize' it by drawing a sharp line between ideology and the supposedly value-neutral. 'objective' content of science. This paper examines how early Soviet computing was shaped by the interplay of military and ideological forces, and affected by the attempts to 'de-ideologize' computers. The paper also suggests some important similarities in the impact of the Cold War on science and technology in the Soviet Union and the United States.

AB The main stages of the USSR/Russian environmental movement's evolution, and the main forms of political activities under critical conditions such as the degradation of the Soviet system, its collapse and transition from a state socialism to a wild bureaucratic capitalism, are examined. The movement is reproduced in interactions with a rapidly changing and risk-laden context. The more turbulent and hostile the movement's context, the stronger was the movement's shift from producing collective actions towards reproducing its own organisations and networks for the defence of local populations and their basic human rights. Field research carried out during 1985-2010 informs the identification of five main stages in the history of the movement.

Our sample consists of 253 political science, sociology, and psychology students in statistics courses. The internal consistency of the Russian SATS is 0.94, however there are some differences in factor structure between the original and the new scale. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI New Social Movements in Russia: A Challenge to the Dominant Model of
   Power Relationships?
SO EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
AB In a context where the dominant model of power relationships is authoritarian, the only possibility for democratization of the system is mobilization from below. Although social and political structures in Russia are quite unfavourable for social mobilization, social protest and citizens' movements have been developing during the past three years. They face serious difficulties attempting to expand themselves and affirm their own values, identities and claims, but they do exist. Their leaders play a key role in taking the initiative to begin collective action and assume responsibility for it. In the activists' milieu we notice a growing sense of powerfulness and a tendency for social trust to reinforce it, thereby creating conditions for possible construction of an alternative model of power relationships. In an adverse context, the expansion of such a model is quite limited and the likelihood of institutionalization of alternative practices quite weak. Nevertheless, a democratic style is developing within activist networks, to a relatively high degree depending on the leaders' personality.

AB A team of Russia- and U.S.-based geographers presents and discusses the economic and demographic consequences of the conflicts in Chechnya on that republic, on the neighboring ethnic republics of the North Caucasus, as well as on the adjoining region of Stavropol' with a majority of Russian inhabitants. Formal economic indicators, which generally exhibit negative trends since 1991, are contrasted with the large, diverse shadow economy that tends to absorb federal development funding diverted from the formal sector to the benefit of local elites. The authors explore the extent to which economic activity once based in Chechnya is dispersed to contiguous regions, discuss changes in the ethnic composition of the republics ("de-Russification"), and consider whether Chechnya and the adjoining republics will ever regain the close economic, political, and social ties with Russia that prevailed during the Soviet period.

AB Objective: To evaluate how the regulatory environment and health system organisation, financing and provider payment systems influence the delivery of mental health services in the Sverdlovsk region of the Russian Federation.
   Methods: A multi-methods study was conducted including analysis of routine data and key informant interviews supplemented by analysis of published literature, legal and regulatory documents, ministerial orders and reports.
   Results: Mental health care services are still largely provided in hospitals, although the need for more community-based and rehabilitation services is widely recognised. Resource allocation and provider payment systems remain largely unchanged from Soviet times and favour large inpatient institutions, creating incentives for hospitals to maintain a large number of beds and staff. Community-based social services and human resources remain limited, especially in the areas of social work, housing support and vocational rehabilitation, but co-operation across sectors at local level is growing.
   Conclusion: In Russia, the pace of reform in the mental health system will be helped if financial resource allocation mechanisms and provider payment systems are also reformed, so that resources follow individuals regardless of where they are treated. Such major health system shifts can only be achieved through changes at the Federal level and require major political will. Additional transitional funding is also required to help develop the necessary alternative community-based services. The nature of mental health disorders mean that this is not a problem faced within the health system alone, greater attention needs to be placed also on how to maximise the cross sector benefits especially with the social protection and employment sectors.

ID NETWORK AUTO-CORRELATION
AB The authors reanalyze Claessen's data set on the "Early States." Though Claessen's Early State typology is largely justified, we suggest some corrections and amendments to his typologization and his model of Early State evolution. We show that the development of personal ownership of land correlates rather weakly with the political development of the Early State, and that political development might be accompanied by the strengthening of communal ownership. We also examine the correlation between Early State political development and ruler sacralization. Though this correlation is insignificant for the whole sample, its insignificance is accounted for by two distinct evolutionary patterns. The pattern observed in the "axial age" zone is characterized by a strong negative correlation between political development and ruler sacralization, while the pattern observed throughout the rest of the world is characterized by a strong positive correlation between the two variables. The authors discuss possible causes of this difference.

AB The Kosovo war of 1999 brought the checkered legacies of Russian and Western geopolitics back to the forefront of international relations. Central to the discussions of the Balkans is its century-old legacy as a Shatterbelt or Crush Zone. Though not identified by Saul Cohen as a Shatterbelt during the Cold War, the region is now located where the maritime (Western) and land power (Russian) geostrategic realms come into contact. NATO expansion and Russian insecurities about the region's future have revised interest in geopolitical linkages and historical antecedents. The tradition of pan-Slavism, linking Russia to the Balkans cultural and political networks, has been uneven and is now subject to intensive debate within Russian political circles. In 1999, public opinion surveys showed consistent support in NATO countries for the bombing of Yugoslavia but strong opposition in Russia and other Slavic states. The surveys also question many stereotypes, especially the geopolitical visions of Russian citizens. Modem geopolitics is differentiated from classical geopolitics by the insertion of public opinion into the formation of geopolitical codes and foreign policy, in both the western countries and in Russia. In such an environment, the Balkans will remain central to the strategies of the great powers but public opinion, modifying geopolitical cultures, will ameliorate confrontations.

TI REFORM DESIGN: HOW TO SEARCH FOR INTERIM INSTITUTIONS
SO MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Institutional reform; Institutions; Interim institutions
AB Institutional reform is defined as a feasible sequence of interim institutions in an appropriate institutional space; the sequence "connects" an initial institution (or a system of institutions) with final one which is considered as desirable by reform designers. Interim institutions are necessary since direct one-step transition ("shock therapy") is usually very costly or even not feasible at all due to cultural, institutional, resource, technological or political constraints. Interim institutions soften these obstacles for the reform step by step so that the whole sequence, leading to the final desirable institution, turns out to be feasible and efficient.
   Saying it by another way, each interim institution softens reform constraints to increase efficiency of transformation of its predecessor into its follower. The main reform design problem is to find the feasible and most efficient sequence of interim institutions.
   The concept of interim institution was introduced in Polterovich (2001, 2007, in Russian). In this paper, a classification of interim institutions is suggested. Sometimes, interim institutions can be built by a development of institutions that already exist in the reforming country. Another case occurs when interim institutions are new inventions. The third, the most important case for developing countries, takes place when interim institutions are transplanted from more advanced systems. I illustrate these concepts analyzing a number of reforms: price liberalization, international trade liberalization and privatization in Russia and China, as well as the unification of Europe. The role of regional and sectored institutional experimentation for finding of interim institutions is underlined. I describe also a methodology of institutional transplantation, and its application to the problem of creation of mass mortgage credit system in transition economies. In this connection, results of an experiment in one of Russian regions are presented.

In this article, I present a partial theory of post-Soviet regime change and attempt to explain the outcomes of elite conflicts in post-Soviet states and their consequences for regime change. The account of political transformations in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus will outline certain common features and peculiarities of regime change in each case and provide several implications for comparative studies of regime change.

AB Wrestling with basic problems of causal inference between institutions and outcomes has been a central focus of political science over the last decade, and as elsewhere in the discipline, scholars of postcommunism have begun to make some headway on these problems. Their efforts have not only advanced important debates about postcommunism, but also in many cases addressed long-standing concerns in political science. This is in itself a sign that after years on the periphery of political science prior to 1989, the study of politics and economics in postcommunist Eurasia has come in from the cold.

AB This essay examines the current debates regarding the politics of human rights. The universal concept of human rights is considered as a regulative principle for the possible critique of any state, including a democratic one. Moreover, the philosophical justification of the universal regulative principle for evaluating these states is vital for progressive political change and for the politics of human rights. At the heart of the analysis is Kant's concept of human rights as freedom. It is opposed to a more utilitarian interpretation of rights and political paternalism. Kant's philosophy helps us to better understand the meaning of the definition of human rights as inherent, sacred, and inalienable, as formulated by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence. Kant makes these meanings explicit, and he elaborates on the moral-philosophical explanations of humanitarian rights. His philosophy of law was developed in a process of a systematic criticism of political paternalism (which is the flip side of dependence). Kant developed his definition of individual freedom in opposition to authoritarian paternalism, utilitarian arbitrariness, and the "despotism of paternalistic benevolence." The categorical imperative is threefold: the imperatives of morality, right, and peace. Thus it could be interpreted as "the categorical imperative of peace." The analysis shows the ongoing relevance of Kant's ideas and their recent development by the theorists of "discourse ethics" and of "cosmopolitan democracy." It affirms that the solution to the problems of securing peace and protecting human rights can only be achieved by peaceful means, based on the international rule of law.

AB A Russian and a U.S.-based political geographer explore how geopolitical cultures and traditions function in imagining and discursively framing events in specific regions within a particular state. More specifically, this paper undertakes a focused examination of competing elite storylines in Russian geopolitical culture about the North Caucasus during an eventful year (October 2005-September 2006) that encompassed the large-scale terrorist attack against the city of Nal'chik, the change of leadership in Dagestan, and the assassination of the prominent terrorist Shamil Basayev by federal forces. The paper first summarizes Kremlin, left/ Communist, national-patriotic, and liberal "storylines" on the basis of a content analysis of major periodicals representing each of these viewpoints, followed by a survey of the opinions of ordinary citizens in the North Caucasus (n = 2,000) regarding the validity of these storylines.

AB Following a short-term burst of migration activity after the dissolution of the USSR, the current situation is marked by the unusually low population territorial mobility, defined by both the political and, increasingly, the socioeconomic factors. While this trend indicates some degree of minority accommodation, it also demonstrates the depth of economic crisis and increasing socioeconomic differentiation. Visible also is the disproportionate influence exercised by Russia on the formation of migration flows in the region. Remaining the major recipient of migrants, Russia increasingly plays a role of supplier of labor migrants to the West, and acts as a "bridge" for those attempting to reach Western Europe. Meanwhile, Russia still lacks an effective legislative base, institutional mechanisms, and political will for dealing with the new migration flows.

TI Small business in Russia: any prospects after a decade?
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB At the start of the 21st century, there were less than I million small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in Russia. Most of these were in Moscow or St.-Petersburg. Employment in SMEs has fallen in the last 3 years to about seven million people. The proportion of SMEs per thousand of population is well below European levels. Should these downward trends be changed, and if so how? The potential for entrepreneurship amongst the Russian people appears to be no different from other European countries and the strategies adopted in business are equally resourceful. The authors suggest that the political economic environment requires significant change, not so much in the actual regulations as in the balance given to them relative to other stakeholder groups and the will to implement existing policies. The results could make a huge difference, leading to either a continued fall in SMEs and the associated formal economy, or a quadrupling of their contribution to GDP in the next 10 years.

AB The author studies variables that are usually regarded as the main causes of the decline of unilineal descent organization (statehood, class stratification and commercialization), along with a variable that has never been regarded as such a cause-deep Christianization. He finds that the traditionally accepted causes of the decline of unilineal descent organization are less significant (rho = -.26 for the statehood; rho = -.18 for class stratification, and rho = -.23 for commercialization) than deep Christianization (phi = rho = -.7). He also shows that the presence of unilineal descent groups correlates negatively with communal democracy and is especially strong for complex traditional societies (phi = -.49, gamma = -.84). Because the communal democracy correlates positively with the supracommunal one, the Christianization of Europe might have contributed to the development of modern democracy by helping to destroy unilineal descent organization in this region.

AB Presented in the article is a mathematical urbanization model which makes one suggest that the highest probability of bloody upheavals that may ensue in the course of internal political life, should be inherent in the indices of the proportion of the urban population between 7,5 and 22,5 per cent. This hypothesis has been corroborated by an empirical cross- national test. It has been demonstrated that at early stages of modernization, the urbanization growth is accompanied by growth of the probability of particularly bloody sociopolitical upheavals; however, further growth of urbanization is accompanied by a decrease of this probability. On the whole, with urbanization higher than 15 to 22,5 per cent, statistically significant negative correlation between urbanization level and probable frequency of occurrence of bloody political upheavals is observed.

ID DEMOCRATIC PEACE; SCIENCE
AB This article addresses the question of interaction between Western and "non-Western" international relations (IR) by analyzing liberal theory of IR that is emerging in contemporary Russia. We argue that, despite a growing diversity within Russian scholarship of liberal orientation, it remains largely a product of Western, particularly American, intellectual hegemony, and more so than any other theoretical perspective. As compared to two other existing traditions in Russian IR-realism and critical studies-liberalism remains the most dependent and therefore must be explored before any other traditions as a crucial case for understanding the dialectic of cultural dependence and hegemony in production of global knowledge. We argue that the greater dependence of Russian liberal IR results from its relatively weak indigenous tradition, perception of Russia's material weakness as opportunity, and greater availability of Western research funds. We also discuss an alternative, less dependent version of Russian liberal IR, and opportunities that its existence implies for development of a global, de-centered international relations theory.

DT Article
ID NUMBER
AB From a normative perspective, one of the major merits of electoral systems involving proportional representation (PR) is that they entail high levels of correspondence between voters' preferences, as expressed at the polls, and the levels of representation attained by political pat-ties. From December 2003, federal law made it imperative to use mixed electoral systems in Russia's regional legislative elections. Thus PR, previously used in only a few regions, emerged as it principal mechanism of representation at the sub-national level of the Russian polity. The political incentives that drove this sweeping reform had little to do with normative considerations. When bringing mixed electoral systems to the regions, the federal centre apparently sought to open Lip the regional political arenas to national political influences, which could be achieved by introducing national political parties as important actors in regional elections.(1) However, one might expect that even if without clear intent, high proportionality of electoral outcomes could have emerged as a side product of the electoral reform. It did not. Instead, the conversion of votes into seats in Russia's regional elections produced persistently disproportional outcomes that greatly favoured some political forces at the expense of others. The goal of this study is to examine this idiosyncratic tendency and to build an explanatory model incorporating both institutional and political determinants of disproportionality. By its methodological design, the Study is based primarily on a statistical analysis of aggregate electoral results.

DE history dependence; political equilibrium
AB Almost all democratic societies evolved socially and politically out of authoritarian and nondemocratic regimes. These changes not only altered the allocation of economic resources in society but also the structure of political power. In this paper, we develop a framework for studying the dynamics of political and social change. The society consists of agents that care about current and future social arrangements and economic allocations; allocation of political power determines who has the capacity to implement changes in economic allocations and future allocations of power. The set of available social rules and allocations at any point in time is stochastic. We show that political and social change may happen without any stochastic shocks or as a result of a shock destabilizing an otherwise stable social arrangement. Crucially, the process of social change is contingent (and history-dependent): the timing and sequence of stochastic events determine the long-run equilibrium social arrangements. For example, the extent of democratization may depend on how early uncertainty about the set of feasible reforms in the future is resolved.

ID REFORM
AB Using survey data from Russian villages, this article examines the development of a rural class structure in postrommunist Russia. It is argued that as a result of market reforms, social and economic relations have evolved beyond stratification, and that, rather, a rural class structure is emerging. Five measures of an emerging class structure are posited: income stratification, land holdings, capital stock, class consciousness, and shared attitudes and values. Focusing on upper and lower income strata, significant differences are documented for each measure. The economic and political implications of the findings are discussed.

AB The paper estimates party-related and non-party-related factors of electoral success in single-member district elections to the Russian State Duma in December 1999. As demonstrated by the analysis, both kinds of factors facilitate candidates' performance, but the utility of personal political resources of non-electoral origins is greater than that of party support. Thus it is likely to be valued by Russian politicians as a supplement, not as a core component of their electoral strategies. By distorting the structure of incentives for elite partisanship, this situation conserves party system underdevelopment in the country. (C) 2002 The Regents of the University of California.

ID PHYSICS
AB Collectivist philosophy inspired David Bohm's research program in physics in the late 1940s and early 1950s, which laid foundations for the modem theory of plasma and for a new stage in the development of the quantum theory of metals. Bohm saw electrons in plasma and in metals as capable of combining collective action with individual freedom, a combination that he pursued in his personal and political life. Mathematical models of such complex states of freedom, developed by Bohm and other socialist-minded physicists (Yakov Frenkel, Lev Landau, Igor Tamm), transformed the physics of condensed matter and led to the introduction of a new fundamental physical concept, collective excitations or quasiparticles. Together, these contributions illustrate the impact of socialist thought on the development of physics during the last century.

AB 11 September woke the world up to the scourge of the twenty-first century-suicidal terrorism. Hostage-taking coupled with suicidal terrorism is its newest variant, played out in a Moscow theater in late October 2002. Forty Chechen terrorists armed with automatic rifles, grenades and self-detonating bombs announced to 800 plus hostages that the event was a suicide mission. The standoff ended when Russian Special Forces gassed and stormed the building, killing all the terrorists. Suicidal terrorists are rarely, if ever, observed in action. In the first months after the event, an American psychologist collaborated with Russian Academy of Sciences colleagues to collect interviews from the hostages. This article reports on hostages' observations, interactions and conversations with the 40 suicidal terrorists.

AB This article explores the region-level impediments to the process of party formation in Russia during 1993-2002. The design of Russia's national electoral system produces parties because they are entitled to contest the proportional part of legislative elections. Once produced in this way, parties are motivated to penetrate into the regions. However, the article empirically demonstrates that the parties' attempts to penetrate the peripheries of the country have failed throughout the period. Region-level factors that impede the process of party formation include the dominant modes of separation of power, electoral systems, and the patterns of intra-elite conflict in the regions. In turn, the lack of territorial penetration makes national political parties unsustainable.

This article concentrates on the impact of future enlargement (with the current negotiating 12 candidates) on power distribution in the Council of Ministers of the European Union and the European Parliament based on the decisions taken at the Nice Summit in December 2000. It uses the Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf indices to evaluate past and emerging power distributions in both the Council and in the Parliament. A brief section on Turkey (the thirteenth, non-negotiating, official candidate) is included to evaluate its possible impact in the case of admission to the Union.

AB The paper examines the impact exerted upon women's legislative representation by political parties and electoral systems under the specific conditions of the early phase of party system formation. Using the data from the 1995-8 regional legislative elections in Russia, the paper demonstrates that party nomination tends to replace independent candidacy as the major tool of the legislative recruitment of women. By assuming party labels, women enhance their electoral chances to a larger extent than men do. However, incentives to nominate women are most visible among strong organizations that often monopolize the local arenas of party politics. Under electoral systems with large district magnitudes, the overall importance of political parties increases. At the same time, such electoral systems support political fragmentation that makes ticket-balancing strategies less feasible. This explains why gains in party system development generated by electoral systems are not conducive to increased women's representation.

The dynamic history of administrative border changes in the region is reviewed against the backdrop of population movements (most dramatically Stalin's 1944 deportation of the Ingush people) and shifting federal-local alliances. The primary focus is Oil the unresolved territorial dispute in Prigorodnvy Rayon. affected Strongly by population displacement from Georgia in the early 1990s. After reviewing the causes of this dispute, which flared into open warfare in late October 1992, tire paper examines two of its outcomes: the localized geopolitics of displacement and return on the ground in Prigorodnyy, and the impact of North Ossetia's geopolitical entanglements in general oil ethnic attitudes. Results of a Public Opinion survey (N = 2000) in the North Caucasus conducted by the authors revealed high levels of ethnic pride among Ossetians and a generally positive attitude toward relations with other nationalities. Duly noted is the August 2008 confrontation involving Russia and Georgia over neighboring South Ossetia. which generated a new flow of refugees.

ID POLITICAL-PARTIES; COMMUNIST-PARTY; SYSTEMS; POWER
AB Persistently high levels of voter volatility in Russia can be explained with reference to the lack of stable party identifications in the electorate. Alternatively, and increasingly in correspondence with the available survey evidence, the principal source of volatility can be found in party system properties. This article contributes to the second theory by exploring the sources of volatility between the 2003 national legislative elections and regional legislative elections that were held concurrently or within one year after the national ones. The analysis demonstrated that the results of regional elections were strongly affected by the varying structures of party alternatives. Voter choice in regional elections is found to be strongly influenced by variations on such parameters as the number of parties and the presence or absence of electoral blocs as principal means of articulating local issue dimensions.

TI TWIN CITIES: A NEW FORM OF CROSS-BORDER COOPERATION IN THE BALTIC SEA
   REGION?
SO BALTIC REGION
LA English
DT Article
DE twin cities; cross-border cooperation; the Baltic region
AB The paper demonstrates the first attempt in Russian political studies to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the "twin city" movement as a form of cross-border cooperation in the Baltic region. This phenomenon emerged as a result of a global tendency towards more active involvement of municipal units in international cooperation, on the one hand, and aspirations of frontier cities and towns in the Baltic region to solve common problems together, on the other hand. This work is based on a comparative analysis method and a case study methodology. The authors consider four examples (city pairs): Tornio - Haparanda, Valga - Valka, Narva - Ivangorod and Imatra - Svetogorsk.
   The article specifies the terminological framework used in this field of research. The authors analyse achievements and failures of this type of international inter-municipal cooperation and emphasise that for twin cities it served not only as a means of survival in the difficult situation of the 1990s, but also as an experimental ground for new forms of crossborder cooperation.
   The authors arrive at the conclusion that this model proves to be promising for further development of integration processes in the Baltic region. This practice can be applied by Russian municipal, regional and federal authorities in promotion of cross-border cooperation not only in the Baltic region, but also in other regions of the country. Thus, influenced by the successful experience of Baltic frontier cities and towns, the Russian city of Nikel and the Norwegian city of Kirkenes decided to adopt this model for further development of their cooperation.

Based on the results of the representative surveys that were conducted in 2006 and in 2008 by the program of the European Social Survey, the paper concludes that the digital divide in Russia is increasing. In the meantime the differences in political preferences and in the level of political participation between Internet-users and non-users in Russia at the moment remain to a certain degree insignificant.

DT Article
ID CARE
AB From its inception after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the centrally controlled Soviet medical system attempted to monopolize medical practice-stigmatizing and punishing alternative practitioners who worked outside the state system. Nonetheless, alternative medical practitioners survived the seven decades of Soviet power. Ordinary people never stopped seeking them out, and since the late 1980s, the number of alternative healers in the Russian Federation has increased astronomically. The aim of this article is to analyze the forms of alternative medicine that exist in contemporary Russia and to offer an explanation for their continuing popularity in terms of popular conceptions of health and healing, the functioning of the state medical care system, and the attitudes of Russian physicians toward alternative healing.

Further on, the author retraces in detail the evolution, the programmatico-political positioning and the functions of the "United Russia" party and comes to the conclusion that the tasks of Russia's modernization demand qualitative renewal of this party.

Each draws its inspiration from Marx but the Tsagalov approach is more general in that it is applicable equally to socialism as to capitalism. Political factors prevented the Tsagalov methodology from coming to fruition in the Soviet Union. In the current more liberal environment it provides a framework for Russian and Post Keynesian economics to explore possible future development.

LA English
DT Article
DE political elites; bureaucracy
AB This paper deals with the process of elite recruitment in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The analysis of CIS countries' experiences allows a correlation to be drawn between the model of elite organization and the political and economic policies they pursue. As a rule, based on the mold of traditionalist (patron-client) relations, elites act as the agents of de-modernization and re-traditionalization. Organized on the principles of rational bureaucracy, elites are able to ensure modernization. Looking at the evolution of the CIS countries from this angle, the author investigates three groups of states. Two of these represent an almost ` ideal type' or ` clean' example of implementing the reference model. Byelorussia, at one end of the spectrum, is an example of a bureaucratically run state. On the other side of this spectrum are the countries of post-Soviet Central Asia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, which embody the model of the clannish elite. The third group of countries are those states maintaining an in-between position within the proposed line of analysis, or those post-Soviet polities marked by a complicated plexus and sometimes also by an acute struggle between different models (Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, and Moldova).

AB No problem of Cold War history has attracted such serious attention as the decision-making process of the highest state bodies. The more traditional approaches in history are applied to this delicate sphere the more puzzles a student of the subject matters. Even though the USSR party and state apparatus were interlocked and the party nomenclature was predominant over the state bodies, the role and place of particular party organizations in Soviet foreign policy activity have been unjustifiably ignored. Until now, there have been no special studies on the perceptions of the world international system which existed inside the Central Committee of the CPSU. But they had very great significance and served in some ways as the basic preferences of the party apparatus in its analysis of the international situation, geostrategic system, political and ethnic events in the world.

A specific focus is on the establishment of nomadic dan obshchinas in the Sakha Republic, and analysis of their spatial patterns within the republic. The paper then discusses how these units may serve as a possible hedge against secessionist sentiments in the south at the same time that they symbolize the republic government's commitment to preserving the rights of non-Sakha residents.

ID MOBILIZATION; PROTEST
AB The paper discusses the 1 July 2008 mass protest in Mongolia. This event has no precedent in Mongolian history and represents a challenge for the social sciences as neither scholars nor political leaders predicted or even admitted its eventuality. Several forms of exclusion economic, social and institutional - are considered as its potential source. It is argued that the theory of institutional exclusion allows making better sense of the situation. Institutional exclusion means the alienation of ordinary people from government and their inability to rely on the law and official procedures when being engaged in everyday activities. Two sources of primary data inform the analysis: a series of structured interviews with the protesters (N = 20) and a collection of visual records made during the unrest (N = 244). The data were processed using methods of both qualitative and quantitative content analysis.

AB The challenge of implementing administrative reform (AR) in the Russian Federation corresponds to international ideas and practice of improving public administration that were conceptually based on the theory of New Public Management (NPM), which supposes the delegation of some state functions to commercial structures and civil society institutes. However, the results of the efforts to implement AR in Russia are not yet satisfactory. An important cause of failure was the fact that the application of the AR model to Russian conditions had not been conceptually worked out to a sufficient degree and, in particular, the question of the role and functions of contemporary government had not been thought through. In essence, the attempt was made to apply a number of sound and rational principles in the absence of many key preconditions that evoke a need for this model.

Extending a previous study, we show how a change in two assumptions-that regional governors were at best neutral in their support of Yel'tsin in 1996 rather than in full support, and that their influence is greater on average in outlying rayons than in regional centers-brings various patterns in the data from all three elections in line with the hypothesis that part of the observed correlation between reform and voting patterns in the 1996 election should be attributed to political boss influence.

AB "Social constructing of time" attempts to unite ethnic, cultural, social and political conceptions of time. Understanding structures of subjective time is of special importance today, when transforming Russian society made paramount studies of individual time reception in various social groups under changing social stratification. Basing on Russian-language, and international sources, author asserts that velocities and rhythms of social change are uneven in different spheres of social life and in subjective evaluations made by various population groups. Subjective time of the above groups was, however, studied so far in a fragmented way. Norms regulating attitudes to time and to its use have to be studied as well involving, inter alia, group stereotypes "We-They in time". Social ideas about social time are seen as a way to more precise forecasting dynamic attitudes to social transformations.

AB "Russian business elite transformation, 1998-2002" analyses trends in changing roles played by Russian business elite in social, economic and political developments after the 1998 financial crisis. Basic venues and means to shape Russian oligarchy (understood as a group of property owners with an all-important influence in politics) are shown in the article. Comparing main 1993 and 2001 characteristics of the business elite, specifics of its growth in 1995-96 and a notable change of the situation in 1998, author locates two cohorts of its representatives - an old "Eltsyn's time" guard along with a new post-Eltsyn group. The latter is characterized by its provincial origins, by tighter links with native industries, and growing cooperation with the governing authorities. Trends in interrelations of businesses with authorities in the regions, as well as impact of Putin's politics on the larger businesses are emphasized.

AB While most scholars took Cicero's Stoicism to be reflected in the content of his theories, this article tries to examine the 'how' rather than the 'what' of his statements. The article starts with the privileging of the verb in what the Stoics termed lekta, then considers how the term res publica fared in full lekta, pronounced by Cicero and his republican contemporaries (first and second sections). Then a Stoic theory of definition is analysed to elucidate an incorporeal quality of the res publica and stresses the particularity of Cicero's theoretical achievement (third and fourth sections). Section V compares the uses to which the term res publica was put in the speech acts of republican and imperial days, while Section VI evaluates the implications of the findings for our contemporary theory of the state.

SO CAHIERS DU MONDE RUSSE
LA Russian
DT Article
AB The article examines how the Legislative Commission members (1754-1766) went about constructing social categories, taking the example of the projects on the nobility's rights and privileges. In these projects, noble reformers of the era strived to create a well-ordered state (un Etat bien police) ensuring the nobility's primacy. In the 1750s, Russian enlightened nobles used Montesquieu's concept of "moderate monarchy" (monarchie temperee) to disprove assertions that the Russian political system was despotic by nature, and justify legislative authorization of the nobility's privileged status. In what was a new precedent in Russian history, the Elizabethan Legislative Commission gave detailed descriptions of the nobility's and merchant's rights and liberties. This stemmed from the development of the aristocratic elite's political ideas in the mid-eighteenth century, and demonstrated that the nobility was familiar with European political theories and was deeply aware of its social interests as expressed in westernized terms and concepts.

DE environmental activism; environmental debates; media; resources; Russia;
   science; state; values
AB This article presents the results of long-term research aimed at identifying the major trends in environmental debates conditioned by Russian reforms and by the changing geopolitical situation of the Russian nation-state. The main topics of the article are changes in the very subject of these debates, the actors involved, the political opportunity structure of the debates and the character of the languages used by their participants. Four major shifts have been identified and analysed: first, from long-term to short-term issues; second, from nationwide to 'insular' debates conditioned by the division of Russians into those who live in time and in space; third, from value-centred to economically oriented; and fourth, from humanistic to social-technological. Epistemologically, these shifts indicate a process of transition from instructive to discursive production of scientific knowledge that should take into account local knowledge; in terms of sociology of social knowledge, this means a change in the relationships between science and publics that have acquired a right to speak; in cultural terms, it marks a shift from scientific to cultural rationality; and in institutional and organizational terms, it means a shift from debates in big national public arenas to issue-centred bargaining in which official and citizen experts compete.

AB The state origins are the perpetual issue in social studies. The contemporary conceptions of the state formation differ in multiple ways from the classical theories. The state was resulted by two interrelated processes - consolidation of the society (integrative theory) and regulating of structural clash in the society (conflict theory). At present there are several most popular theories revealing the different ways of the state origin. In recent years many scholars believe that the societal complexity is not always related to the formation of statehood. They adhere to the multilinear theory of social transformation and identify several forms of political systems alternative to the state.

AB The article deals with questions of theory and methodology of analysis of regional political regimes in modern Russia. The author proposes to study regional political regimes with resort to considering three "axes" "monopoly - oligopoly" ("consolidation - competition"), "the center the - regions" ("autonomy - dependency") and "democracy - authoritarianism". For each of these axes a set of corresponding variables has been elaborated, that allows to estimate and to compare regional political regimes, making apparent the extent of autonomy of a regional political regime within the national one, the structure and the methods of power relations. The proposed methodology makes possible cross-regional (within Russia) and cross-national studies, as well as more detailed regional case studies.

AB This paper examines the role of social cleavages in creating spatial associations between major pre-Revolutionary and post-Soviet political parties at the guberniya-level statistical aggregates. The paper begins with a theoretical discussion of social cleavages and a literature review of cleavage theory research applied to various Russian elections. The analysis of spatial associations between the pre-Revolutionary/ post-Soviet parties involved elaborating a new measurement framework, creating a spatial database using GIS, transformation of thematic social-economic-geographic attributes, calculating the strength of the linear relationship among regional spatial units and utilizing probit statistical models. This research empirically supports the hypothesis that contemporary Russian parties are expressions of rediscovered cleavages as well as of conflicts engendered by the Tsarist and Soviet and post-Soviet periods of development. It appeared that the constituent assembly election of 1917 and parliamentary election of 1995 tend to be "maintaining'' elections for the liberals. The situation appeared different for the communitarian parties. A critical realignment - significant changes in the left electorate and a split in this electorate did occur. The 1995 election results indicate that only parties with developed networks and local and regional organizations faired well in the election and that nationalization of Russian political life was still weak in 1995.

He redefines the concepts, methods and areas of application of those parts of the research. He stresses particularly the contemporary period, highlighting discussion of postmodern approaches. The first group of these approaches emphasizes the evolution of territorial identities and relations betweent centre and periphery, the main factors in establishing borders and their functions. The second group stresses the importance of geopolitical factors, including cultural differences between neighbouring territories. To a huge extent security considerations preoccupy this group, which tries to explain changes in border regimes. The third group is concerned with the influence of perceptions of the contemporary world's diversity on political elites and public opinion. Finally other approaches analyse borders starting from a combination of political and institutional factors as well as perceptions of cross-border networks at several territorial levels.

AB Purpose - This paper is an attempt to sketch the influence of the German Historical School on the development of Russian economic thought at the boundary of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and, particularly, on the forming of its socio-ethical trend with an alternative approach in solving the "social question".
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper is designed as a brief outlook of the history of the Russian economic thought at the pre-revolutionary time and of the main theoretical debates on the paths of Russia's economic development.
   Findings - It can be seen that at the turn of the century a new socio-ethical trend of political economy in the Russian economic science was being shaped under the influence of the German Historical School's ideas and their creative re-evaluation. Representatives of this trend - Bulgakov, Miklashevsky, Tugan- Baranovsky and others - addressed the problems of "social ideal", "social policy" and ethical principle in political economy. They were promoting the social reforms as the path to social compromise.
   Originality/value - The reconstructuring of Russia's political and economic system in the last decade of the twentieth century and transition to a market- oriented economy gave rise to a modern wave of debates over the fundamentals of economic theory. The present paper focuses on the importance of the humanistic approach in the theory of social economy that involves historical, philosophical, legal and others points of view on the economic life of society.

   integration; historical legacies for integration
ID REGIONALISM; SECURITY; EUROPE; EU
AB This paper focuses on post-Soviet regional integration as a special case where integration projects are established by countries that originally comprised a single political entity after its collapse. It shows that in this framework the existing economic ties between countries are likely to affect adversely the interest of functional bureaucracy to support regional integration given that cutting existing connections is often more promising from the point of view of the budget expansion. Hence, the interaction of national and supranational bureaucracies is unlikely to generate impetus for increasing regional cooperation, which, surprisingly, can, however, be supported by adverse economic shocks. The results are validated using the experience of two low-level politics sectors of interaction in the post-Soviet space: electricity and transportation.

ID ECONOMICS; SCIENCE
AB The institutional environment of science differs across countries. Its particularities have an impact on productivity of scientific enterprise in terms of both research and teaching. Reform of the system of higher education occupies an important place in programs of catch-up modernization. Attempts to replicate Western institutional arrangements and organizational designs in this area have been undertaken in Russia since the very beginning of economic and political reforms of the 1990s. This paper considers a particular transplant, the Higher School of Economics (HSE) established in 1992, and its subsequent evolution. A structural analysis shows its divergence from the organizational patterns that served as a model. The HSE case is compared with several "representative" Western universities as well as other Russian universities. When explaining divergent patterns between the HSE and the Western counterparts, special attention is paid to the issue of power relationships and their role in the functioning of the scientific organization. The paper aims to contribute to the discussion of "cultural entrepreneurs" and their motivation.

DE Social Identity; Regional Identity; Siberia; Identity Politics
AB The concept of social identity is being reconsidered in the social sciences due to transformations undergone by (post)modern societies, such as globalization, localization, and the intensification of global migration. In this context, the Siberian identity (being "Sibiriak") is an interesting object of research for it reflects the cultural, political, and economic effects of globalization and localization, as well as transformations in individual self-perception. This paper demonstrates that Siberian identity is not only a personal matter but also a new type of social solidarity and political claim.
   Using an actionist approach to identity studies, this article explores the core elements and "versions" of Siberian identity, the contexts of its formation and actualization, and regional variations in its manifestations. Two manifestations of Siberian identity-the "Siberian character" and the "Siberian civic nationhood"-are discussed, key dimensions of their actualization (territorial, ethnic, and political) are described, and regional differences in the actualization of identities are analyzed. We conclude by suggesting that the study of Siberian identity highlights the need for, and the value of, the constructionist perspective in the analysis of regional identities in mobile, "resettlement" societies.

DE conditional reflexes; scientific organisation of labour; movement

AB In the last century, the reflex was more than a scientific concept: it was a cultural idiom that could be used to various aims - political, scholarly, and artistic. In Russia in the 1920s, the reflex became a ubiquitous notion and a current word, part of the revolutionary discourse and, finally, a password to modernity. Two major factors contributed to it: physiological theories of the reflex, widespread in Russia at the early twentieth-century, and the materialist philosophy backed after the Revolution by the Communist party. Everybody who wished to be modern and materialist, in conformity with the official communist views, had to refer to reflexes. Yet, even in this period, the concept was not unproblematic and was criticized by some scientists, philosophers, artists and even Party members. In the paper, I describe both the array of uses of the term and the criticism it received in political, scientific and artistic discourses. It is not uncommon that, taking their origins in culture and common language, scientific concepts later return there in the form of metaphors. Similarly, the - ex was made into a rigorous scientific concept in the nineteenth century but, in the next century, it circulated as a cultural idiom penetrating various areas of political, artistic and academic life.

DT Article
AB The article by Mikhail Sokolov is an attempt to apply the sociology of intellectuals' approach to the phenomenon of the Russian New Right. The trend that emerged in France in the 1960s has lost its influence everywhere in Europe except Russia. During the post-Soviet transition, the local "chapter" of the international right intellectual network enjoyed unprecedented popularity. Its leader, Alexander Dugin, became one of a few widely recognized public intellectuals.
   The story of the movement is reconstructed in the first part of the article. The second part discusses the factors of success of the Russian New Right. The author critically scrutinizes and rejects such explanations as a demand for ideological services by the rightist political organizations, or specific esthetic responses by intellectuals to the challenges of the post-communism transformation. Instead, Sokolov reconstructs a specific social structure of competing for cultural capital in the field of production of new meanings. This specific conjuncture allowed the leaders of the New Right to position their paradigm as the most fashionable and promising cultural trend. At the end, the author makes prognoses about the future of the New Right in Russia.

This state-of-the-art article reflects on various developments in the field, analyzes research projects and frameworks, and focuses on two major issues of elite research: stratification studies and transition studies. The formation of an academic community in this field is close to completion. Russian scholars commonly accept different theoretical and methodological approaches from those employed by Western social scientists, but the lack of value-free work and comparative studies makes Russian studies of political elites somewhat isolated from the mainstream of social research.

The article deals - in terms of metaphysics - with the essential alteration of the orientations (on the level of purport of life) proper to the Russian elites (with the changing mechanisms of their legitimation) - elites that have been taking shape throughout the latest five centuries as geocracy (stratum with a historical vocation to gather lands together, to govern them and to defend them), but in the long run have turned into nomadic undertakers oriented on maximization of profits.

TI Analysts: "Consultants" or "Independent Policy Actors"
SO POLITICKA MISAO-CROATIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Review
DE policy analysts; policy consultants; policy actors; policy analysis
AB The author points out empirical indicators to distinguish "consultants" from analysts as "independent policy actors". The complexity of decision-making processes in modern states created demand for independent expert support. This demand has been satisfied by new institutes of intellectual political support - think tanks. Support, an estimation of political decisions and alternatives, generating of ideas, education and elite formation became their functions. According to the functional approach, due to the complexity and scale of modern administrative problems, the expert became an integral part of the decision-making process. In differentiated social systems, in order to increase the efficiency of decisions and to maintain the social "feedback" mechanism, policy-makers involve experts, including think tanks, to work out new and to estimate old political decisions. In these processes think tanks are engaged, conducting researches and consultations for the decision-makers. So in modern states the mechanism of "feedback" is carried out. In practice, we can see some analysts and experts who pretend to play a dominant role in policy; some who legitimize policy of the government, decisions of a political leader or a current political regime; some who conduct professional research and development of the "feedback mechanism" within a policy cycle; and some who have real power on minds of the elites and/or citizens. The author aims to figure out the factors that influence the changing political status of the analysts, what makes them independent political actors, and in what conditions they come to serve the elites' interest. And, most importantly, how we can fix or stabilize the analysts' status as independent and powerful political actors even in an unfavorable political climate.

TI Some Political Meanings of 'Civilization'

LA English
DT Article
ID CULTURE
AB Since the early nineties, the term 'civilization' has undergone remarkable transformations and has assumed political and ideological functions it has not been fit for as a linchpin of the more than two-centuries-old academic discourse on 'civilizations'. These transformations materialized in the political-ideological formations known as the 'clash of civilizations' and the 'dialogue among civilizations' which comprise a 'civilizational discourse' in many respects alternative to the academic one. This essay intends, firstly, to uncover the structural and thematic differences between the academic 'civilizational discourse' and its trendy alternative. Secondly, the essay aspires to demonstrate how complementary, at their methodological and ideological bases, the 'clash of civilizations' and the 'dialogue among civilizations' are, despite their highly-publicized antagonism. Thirdly, the article aims to highlight the actual political processes underway in our world which manifest themselves through and make use of the alternative 'civilizational discourse' as part of their modus operandi. The essay ties these processes with the global triumph of capitalism at the closure of the 20th century, and with the rise of the projects of authoritarian hegemony.

LA Russian
DT Article
AB The cognitive and political framework of Soviet ethno-federalism continues to play significant role in, and to shape, post-Soviet social and political reality. The persistence of that framework makes politicians resort to the idea of autochthonism as a means of affirming the legitimacy of contemporary sovereign states. The idea of autochthonism exerts a decisive influence over new nationalist mythology. It stands at the core of the post-Soviet politics of ethnonational consolidation. The uses of the new nationalist mythology also penetrate the discourse of international relations in the post-Soviet realm. The political demand for autochthonous and ancient ancestors powerfully frames the practice of local scholars and makes them self-impose the ethnonationalist vision of historical and social experience. The myth of ancient ancestors is exploited in the formation of national symbols of new states and it serves as the grounds for mass national holidays tailored to consolidate the nation around a single national leader. At the same time, figures of ancient ancestors are claimed by different nationalist myth-makers, leading to tensions between new sovereign states.

TI Mass terror and the court: The military collegium of the USSR
SO EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Apart from its role in the Moscow show trials during 1936 - 38, the Military Collegium of the USSR Supreme Court under V. V. Ul'rikh also tried some 40,000 'enemies of the people' behind closed doors, sentencing most of them to death. These pseudo-trials of no more than a few minutes took place in prisons or NKVD offices in Moscow or (through the Collegium's assizes) provincial centres. There was no serious investigation of the evidence, and the court turned a blind eye to apparent cases of torture. The judges personally attended executions, occasionally even participating in them. The punishments had been determined beforehand by the political leadership under Stalin by way of lists, with the Military Collegium only 'legalising' the sentences. The defendants originated from the Soviet elite. The aim of this article is to throw more light on this side of the Collegium's activities, mainly based on archival sources. The article suggests that this quasi-legal procedure was adopted by the leadership under Stalin, in preference to purely administrative measures, because it was considered to be less likely to endanger the elite's loyalty.

AB Two experts on Dagestani politics examine the evolution of Dagestan's political system from the era of its first post-Soviet constitution in 1994 to the present. The complicated role played by ethnicity in a political system designed to maintain balance in in ethnically heterogeneous society is considered in light of the changes in the relationship between the federal center and Dagestan over the past 10 years. Paying particular attention to changes in Dagestan's fundamental political structure and Moscow's role in such changes, the authors also consider the implications of recent changes.

AB During the Soviet period the retirement of the country's political elite took a variety of forms, including transfers to honorific positions in which they typically retained their privileges. Under Gorbachev a dramatic increase in the number of retirements exceeded the capacity of such positions to absorb them. The number of retirements increased still further under Boris Yeltsin, and earlier courtesies were no longer observed; the first voluntary retirements began to take place, and repressive retirements. 'Reservations' began to be developed at the same time, from which former officials might be recalled to government service; retirement no longer meant political death. But the development of private business, and of representative institutions, also opened new opportunities for leading officials to resist their marginalization, and even oppose the Kremlin. Putin has since restored stability within the elite, and it is likely that leading officials will reward him for this 'stability of cadres' with their continuing loyalty.

AB The article reports on the progress of Russian research on globalization and equity. Building on Stain Roekan's classification of social cleavages, the author identifies several schools in Russian globalization studies. He then discusses how the distinctions of authority people, church-state, land-industry, owners-workers, metropolis-colony, and network-hierarchy find their reflection in current Russian research. The article shows that Russian scholars have recently engaged in a series of discussions of globalization's equity criteria and their application to democratic governance, utilizing the world system's approach, civilization analysis, and the theory of Kondratieff's cycles.

   BYELARUS; FALLOUT; POLAND
AB The Chernobyl nuclear disaster of April 26, 1986, triggered a chain of devastating events that later included an unexpected increase in childhood thyroid cancer and evidence of iodine deficiency (ID) in Russia. For the Russian people the Chernobyl event had profound psychological impacts, provoking anxiety about nuclear technology and mistrust of governmental control efforts. Frequently in public health a crisis is required to create the political will to manage longstanding problems, and public health officials must rapidly mobilize to take advantage of the opportunity. In this case, ID, previously not seen as a problem in Russia, was recognized to be potentially serious, and the Russian Federation, assisted by the catalytic bi-national effort of the U.S.-Russian joint Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation (Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission (GCC)) established a model salt iodization policy, developed a planning process, and implemented a program to prevent ID through a systematic approach that included the people, government, and private groups using open communication, dissemination of the findings, and action plans. By 1999, political will had been mobilized and over 20% of the nation's salt was being iodized, up from about 1% in 1996. Universal iodization of salt was not a specific objective of the GCC; however, the increasing availability of iodized salt is leading to the elimination of ID, which is now a political goal in Russia. The full realization of this goal will require more time for education, marketing, and possibly legislative action.

TI Russian lobbying in the United States: stages of evolution
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
ID OIL; DEMOCRACY
AB The article examines Russian lobbying in the US. The endogenous and exogenous factors of Russian lobbying are analyzed as well as its qualitative and quantitative characteristics. The article depicts stages of Russian lobbying development: (i) from government to private entities; (ii) nongovernmental lobbying; and (iii) a return to government. Additionally, occasional attempts by Russian entities to secure funding from the US budget are mentioned. Two case studies are studied to show the nature of current Russian lobbying in the US: lobbying campaigns by Techsnabexport, state-owned corporation, and GML, a private business concern. The article concludes that Russian lobbying in the US is weak. At the beginning, it was mostly about investment consulting, and with the rise in oil prices and the decrease in political freedom, the need for and availability of lobbying diminished. Some private corporations were nationalized under President Putin and, as a result, lost control over their international expansion strategies, with the remaining private corporations being afraid of independent lobbying campaigns abroad.

Why is internet considered to be a magic force, which can destroy authoritarian governments around the world? The article criticises a kind of folk political science based on the identity of political mobilization and network activity. The real role of internet in current politics is considered on the basis of the internal evolution of the network, its penetration into ordinary people's everyday life. Modern social networks generate new types of local urban communities and become a backdrop for political change, offering a new culture of publicity.

DT Article
DE Siberia; historical science; Civil war; Soviet power
AB In the crisis periods of socio-political transformation of the Russian society, the professional historical science, as any other branch of humanitarian knowledge, always appeared in a dual position. On the one hand, at this time new possibilities opened for its further development, on the other hand, history as a specific humanity should constantly answer to calls of the new time. In the paper the question of features of development of professional historical researches, including those studying Siberia, on the territory of Western and Eastern Siberia during the Revolution, the Civil War and the first years of the Soviet power is complexly considered for the first time. During the pre-revolutionary period the central and regional public authorities and the Siberian public undertook active attempts to organize its own large centre of historical science in Siberia. So, departments of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society in Irkutsk and Omsk were opened. During this period employees and professors of Imperial Tomsk University conducted historical and regional Siberian studies by their own initiative. However, until the beginning of the Civil War all-Siberia coordination centres of historical science were not established. Only in 1917-1918 in Tomsk and Irkutsk universities Departments of History and Philology were opened with professional historians, whose function was coordination of the historical scientific life of Siberia. At the same time, by the decision of the All-Russia government of Admiral A. V. Kolchak the Institute of Research of Siberia was organized, which was to become the coordinating centre of all scientific researches in Siberia, including regional studies. After the establishment of the Soviet power on the territory of Siberia, the Institute of Research of Siberia and Departments of History and Philology of the Siberian universities were closed. The policy of the Bolsheviks in the first half of the 1920s put an end to attempts of the Siberian public to create an effective system of their own large centre of Siberian historical science and coordination of regional studies. Siberian historians were alienated. It led to losses of potential possibilities of Siberian researchers in carrying out of the general complex study of Siberia and other researches. Only after the war, with restoration of historical departments in Tomsk and Irkutsk universities (in 1960s Novosibirsk university joined them), the situation started to change. Universities began to gain significance as the centres of coordination of historical researches. The result of such activity and associated efforts of Siberian historians was publishing of some fundamental multivolume works in the 1960s -1980s, such as "History of Siberia", "History of Peasantry of Siberia" and "History of Working Class of Siberia".

They look at three periods of crisis in the history of Great Britain and Burke's political actions during each of them. The main task of the article was to make a dictionary of Burke's concepts and to find what he meant by them in particular contexts. In accordance with English legal and 'constitutional' traditions Burke searched for correlations with accepted rules of politics and the principles of the Enlightenment.

AB It is on the basis of modern approaches provided by the new institutional theory that in the present article the institution of civil participation is reappraised as an integral phenomenon securing inclusion of citizens into the political government process. Characterization and analysis of the evolution and of the current state of the institution of civil participation are offered. As is demonstrated by the investigation developed. there are few real public entities. and civil entities are in minority. Nevertheless civil entities, because they possess qualities of a "competent" political actor. of a self-dependent subject of politics, with well-developed "social practical skills", are able to form - and in reality do form - a new. not an imitative, but a real institution of civil participation oriented at citizens' needs for influencing the process of political decision-making.

It is demonstrated that the problem comes down to the thesis of underdetermination of rules, and that this thesis cannot be general. An insufficiency of the straight solution mentioned above and its satisfactory version have been proposed.

SO SIBIRICA-INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF SIBERIAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE assimilation; census; demographic politics; demographic sustainability;
   ethnic re-identification; modernism; North; Siberia; traditionalism
AB This article surveys the population dynamics of twentysix indigenous small-numbered peoples of the Russian North, using the data from eight General Censuses of Russia (1897-2002), and the Polar Census of 1926/27. The article demonstrates that each of these peoples responded to central state policies in diverse ways, and that often different populations of the same group showed differing trends in different regions. During the Soviet period there was strong assimilative pressure on the indigenous small-numbered peoples. The opposite tendency is evident in the post-Soviet period-a process referred to in this article as "ethnic re-identification." Because there was little inter-regional migration of the indigenous peoples, we conclude that the population dynamics of each nationality in each region is the result of the interplay among fertility, mortality, assimilation, and ethnic re-identification.

AB This article provides an attempt to draft a conceptual approach to the problem of the interrelation of domestic and external factors in the processes of the state-building with the special focus on unrecognized and self-proclaimed states. Various methodological and theoretical aspects of external recognition and domestic legitimization of the self-proclaimed new states which are claiming sovereignty are analyzed. An analytical distinction of different levels and qualities of stateness is introduced in the article, in particular building upon some findings of the 'Political Atlas of the Modern World* project. A strong correlation between the levels of stateness and the potential of international influence is used as one of the possible criteria for developing typologies of modern states.

DE Chicherin; Russian philosophy; Hegelianism; Liberalism; Russia
AB This paper considers the philosophical and political views of B. N. Chicherin. Chicherin was one of Hegel's better known followers in Russian philosophy. Chicherin transformed Hegel's ideas to such an extent that the main concept of his philosophy became the concept of the person, and the main problem was the description of the person's connection to the Absolute. Chicherin was also known as a representative of the liberal tradition in Russia. However, he criticized classical western liberalism for belittling the value of the state. Chicherin's liberal theory was under construction in a dialectical combination of two principles: recognition of the absolute value of the person and its freedom and recognition of the necessity of a strong state for the solution of some general problems in the absence of which it will be impossible to realize the principle of freedom in all its completeness.

TI A Catholic or a Politician? The Parliamentary Speech of the 2nd Viscount

SO DIALOG SO VREMENEM-DIALOGUE WITH TIME
LA Russian
DT Article
AB The article analyses a parliamentary speech delivered by Anthony Maria, second Viscount of Montague at the House of Lords in 1604. The text of the speech survived in one manuscript copy (Bodleian Library, Oxford). Its transcription, translation into Russian and commentaries are present in the Appendix. A.Yu. Seregina studies the shifts in the ways the members of the 16th-century English political elite identified themselves. In the mid-16th century members of the Montague family did not see a contradiction between being Catholics and belonging to the top layer of the nation's 'political class'. For the generation of the late 16th - early 17th cc. however, both Catholics and Protestant saw confessional allegiance as a major criteria according to which one could get or be denied access to political power. The Viscount Montague shared such views; he excluded himself from the 'Lords' and presented himself as a leader of the English Catholic community. All his political activities were shaped by confession. Thus confessional 'borders' were delineated by both sides of the conflict.

Iadrintsev, who were the architects of the federalist Siberian oblastnichestvo movement of the second half of the 19th nineteenth century and beginning of the 20th twentieth century. In their day, the work of the oblastniki on the cultural specificity of native Siberian peoples had a great influence on popular opinion, on the popularization of ethnological theory, and on the general social and political credo to reform policy towards these people. The oblastniki rejected both ethnocentrism and Eurocentrism in the comparison of various peoples. Their eventual acceptance of cultural relativism, the idea of equality of cultural values between peoples, and need for a civil understanding of human history were all closely linked to their political program of promoting regionalism. Their regionalist idea put forth the idea that every social and cultural unit had the right to an independent existence and to have control over their own development.

In particular, a pronounced shift from violent crime towards economic crime is being observed. Criminals try to establish and exercise control over legitimate businesses via corrupt politicians, local authorities and/or law enforcement officials. A tendency towards the consolidation of criminal groups within given territories is also discernible, whilst there are signs of increased interregional integration among different criminal organisations.

DT Article
AB The first 18 months of Vladimir Putin's presidency turned out to be a period of unprecedented activity in Russian-Ukrainian relations. A number of problems were seriously approached, among these the issue of Ukrainian gas debts. At the same time, it remains unclear whether the new cooperative dynamics will prevail or whether the conflictual legacy of the 1990s will become an insurmountable impediment to further improvement. This article attempts to analyse the factors which determined the ongoing evolution in Russian-Ukrainian relations in order to demonstrate that the positive dynamics had to do with changes in the views of the Russian leadership and in the export strategies of Russia's big businesses, as well as the evolution of Ukraine's posture vis-a-vis Europe, rather than with the internal political situation in Ukraine in 2001. The article also examines the main remaining controversies between the two countries in the economic and humanitarian spheres and offers a view on whether reciprocally pragmatic approaches are possible.

It shows the affinity of Marx's early critique of liberal state and of Hannah Arendt's criticism of formal legalistic thinking in the contemporary judicial treatment of Nazism (and of similar international political crimes). Marx's critique of nation-state finds its unlikely continuation in Arendt's critique of international law. The politico-theological argument is explicit in Marx and implicit in Arendt, but both develop the Hegelian criticism of liberal state which shows its reliance on the abstract law, on the one hand, and on the egotistic abstract individual, on the other. The theological undercurrent of the argument is both sign of its limitations, and of the subsisting relevance of the politico-theological framework, even in the similarly novel circumstances of the twentieth century. It is only within and through the theological critique and critique of theology that these issues would stand a chance of resolution.

AB A visual image of the political is put into effect in the area of political communication and in the context of political culture. The main representative here is a visual political image that is expressed symbolically. In this regard, the article is focused on the concept of a visual image. The visual image essentially is a product of the imagination where his constructional nature appears. And a political design is carried out by modelling when a political idea is symbolically represented in the visual row of the perceived reality. In other words, the program serves as a representation or a symbolic image of the political world. Further the idea of a visual image is treated in the work on the basis of the concepts "technical image", the apparatus and the program (V. Flusser). The technical image is created by the political apparatus which program is realized by a leader-programmer. But the apparatus can only resign the reality, and the leader depends on this apparatus. As a result, new technical visual political universes are created, such as a photographic political universe. As a technical TV world, it is "dotty" and combinatorial, and not a linear one. So, on the basis of visual phenomena the whole optical regimes are constructed, both Soviet and postmodern ones. The article gives the example of the Stalin optical regime of "panopticon" where the Soviet "spectators" began to see clearly the future that had already came. Also here it is indicated on Putin optical mode of the third-party "viewers" passively perceiving the political world designed around the symbolic figure of the leader.

DE Baltic-Pontic region; interface of civilizations; conflict system; dual

AB This article considers the Baltic-Pontic Sea region not only as a geographical space of Intermarium (Miedzymorze, Tarpjuris etc.) but also as Intermundium or the interface of European and Russian (Eurasian) civilization. The study sets out to clarify the logic of changing patterns shaping this geopolitical area. To this end, the concept of the Baltic-Pontic conflict system proposed by Vadim Tsymbursky is applied and further developed. In contrast to his agent-focused vehicle of analysis disclosing the power interactions in Intermarium, the authors advance an alternative structure-focused model of the BalticPontic system (BPS) as a multidimensional evolving space of heterogeneous interactions, which include cooperation. The authors suggest applying the BPS models in interpreting and clarifying historical developments in the area from the late 14(th) century until the present. The article analyses the spatial, geopolitical and geo-chronopolitical characteristics of the region, as well as the models of intercivilisational interaction between Europe and Eurasia. The author addresses the issue of the political identity of the region and its ability to play an independent role in the world politics.

The author analyzes the monitoring democracy concept and pays special attention to its practical outcomes. An important part of the article is dedicated to the analysis of contradictory, but mostly positive trends that permit to assert the implementation of some traits of monitoring democracy in contemporary social and political life in Russia. A full-fledged implementation of this model could lead to qualitative changes in the overall relations between state and society.

The article begins by situating this research in the context of the theoretical and empirical literature on party origins, organizational development and institutionalization, in general, and party formation theories in post-communist countries, specifically. The impact of organizational features on electoral success or failure is analysed for 24 parties. The models correctly predicted both the successful and failed parties in the 2007 Russian Duma election and offer reasons for the apparent floating party system in Russia.

DE uncertainty; risk; decision-making; philosophy of management;
   rationality; values; contingency; probability; determinism
AB Uncertainty and risk are viewed as interdisciplinary phenomena. This calls for philosophical treatment of results provided by the sciences. The paper reflects the author's methodological position of treating uncertainty and risk-related problems in the decision-making context. The method of decision-making in a situation of uncertainty largely depends on the kind of uncertainty faced by the agent. The author considers various types of uncertainty with a special focus on objective uncertainty and offers a typology of uncertainties in decision-making tasks. Quantitative assessment of the probability of possible events allows to draw a fundamental distinction between situations of risk and situations of uncertainty. A situation of risk is a kind of situation of uncertainty in which it is possible to estimate the probability of decision implementation taking into account environmental influences, the actions of partners and adversaries, etc. In a situation of risk it is possible to make a quantitative assessment of the decision's consequences which can't be done in a situation of uncertainty, and this is the key factor in differentiating between risk and uncertainty. The description of this situation requires using of a complex of notions: <Agent, Decision, Probability, Losses>. Risk is a consequence of the decision and is always related to the agent who not only makes a choice but also estimates the probabilities of possible events and related losses. Risk is an integral indicator combining the assessment of both the probabilities of decision implementation and quantitative characteristics of the decision's consequences.

DE Parmenides; Melissus; Hume; metaphysics; formal; axiology; algebra
AB The paper submits a formal-axiological interpretation of the metaphysical doctrine of Parmenides and Melissus about nonbeing of nonbeing, nonbeing of movement, nonbeing of set, etc. The author constructs and studies a two-valued discrete mathematical representation (model) of formal-axiological aspect of the metaphysical doctrine of mentioned thinkers - two-valued algebra of metaphysics. According to the author's fundamental hypothesis, metaphysics is nothing but formal axiology, in particular, formal ethics and formal jus-naturalism. Starting with this novel hypothesis the paper investigates "being", "nonbeing", "one-ness (unity)", "set", "movement (change)", "contradiction", "non-contradiction", "completeness", "incompleteness", etc. as moral-legal evaluation-functions determined by moral-legal evaluation-variables in proper mathematical meanings of the words "function" and "variable". The evaluation functions and variables take their values from the set of moral-legal values {g (good), b (bad)} of moral-legal-forms of actions. Elementary moral-legal-action-forms deprived of their contents are nothing but moral-legal variables. Compound moral-legal-action-forms deprived of their contents represent moral-legal evaluation-functions. The functions under investigation are precisely defined by tables. A formal-axiological equivalence-relation is precisely defined as well. By means of the given definitions the author constructs a list of equations of two-valued algebra of metaphysics identified with algebra of formal axiology, in particular, with algebra of formal ethics. Results of the mental (hypothetic-deductive) experiment with generating the list of equations are surprising: "translations" of the equations from the artificial symbolic language of algebra into the natural one are nothing but well-known "strange (paradoxical)" statements of Parmenides and Melissus. Hence, according to the studied hypothesis, the famous empirical criticism of the Eleatic metaphysical tenets is a result of misunderstanding them. The metaphysical tenets are affirming formal-axiological equivalences among values. The scandal statements have nothing to do with facts and formal-logic interrelations among facts. Therefore it is relevant to use the principle of formal-logic autonomy of facts and values for protecting Eleatic metaphysics from the empirical criticism. By means of algebra of formal ethics the author submits a precise formulation and fundamental generalization of the famous "Guillotine of D. Hume". The generalized formulation of "Guillotine" is used for protecting Parmenides and Melissus from the empirical criticism.

The authors analyze the projects of A. Bestuzhev-Ryumin, D. Volkov, N. Panin, Ia.

The common concepts of "law' and "council" allowed the political actors to analyze the possible directions of reforms, put them on paper and attempt to put them into practice. The authors of the projects were striving for improvement of legislation process in order to promote greater legality. These projects also include the proposal of an advisory council to guarantee the correspondence of sovereign's lawmaking to the "common good".

AB Analyzed in the article are similarities and distinctions between the former Soviet and today's Russian political systems, as well as the state of modern Russian politics and the prospects of its further evolution. The author makes the main accent in his study on juxtaposing the two main models of political relations in the USSR and in Russia, which, from his point of view, are pluralism and corporatism. In his conclusions the author suggests that. as distinct from the Soviet corporate-pluralistic model of the 1970s to the 1980s. today's Russian model has a very substantial potential of development in the direction of new corporatism and of political pluralism of full value.

Not only theoretical and methodological aspects of the model are exposed, but also a case-study presented, with the regional political space of the Krasnodar territory (RF) as example. In the latter case, a number of relatively autonomous social nets of the territory scale are examined, as well as concrete mechanisms of conversion of the net resources to political capital.

DT Article
AB It is key characteristics of the processes of modern elitogenesis at the global and national levels that are considered in this article. The interest in the study of these processes is preconditioned by the determining influence of politically and economically dominant groups - of the political and the business elites of national and of global level - on the processes of the evolution of polities as a whole. Proving as the determining trends of elitogenesis in industrially developed countries are: essential transformation of the relations within the framework of the elites/masses dichotomy at both the global and national levels of polities; noticeable change of the styles of political leadership in the Western polities; weakening of the most significant foundations of modern Western democracies - of the principle of intra-elite consensus. Detailed research of these tendencies induces the author to turn to studying the reasons and the sources of these moves. It's the processes of recruitment, rotation and intra-elite communications of political elites in the USA that turn out to be the priority subject in the article.

The concluding part of the article identifies those social groups and economic and political players (federal and regional authorities, oligarchic and non-oligarchic big business, trade associations, NGOs and independent think tanks) who are capable of influencing opinion about business and also analyses their possible actions in the medium-term future.

AB The author argues that international political economy (IPE), however prominent in the West, has not been established in Russia as an academic discipline. In the Russian policy community, the main debate is between liberal institutionalists, who advocate the country's integration into the global economy, and the so-called dirigists, who promote relative economic autonomy. These two schools, however, only now begin to find their way in academia. Three main problems impede IPE development in Russia-the excessive separation of political science from economics, the deficit of theoretical generalization, and the weakness of educational curricula.

AB "Regional elite formation: principles and mechanisms" (by Ol'ga Kryshtanovskaya) looks into present-day factors and ways of recruiting regional political elite under conditions when elective principles are introduced for regional No's I and members of respective legislatures. Statistical data are used to describe election campaigning and appointments to positions in respective governance bodies between 1989 and 2002. Factors of former nomenclature background are analyzed related to present-day regional elite, bodies supplying 'governor' posts, 'administrative resource factor in providing shape to executives and legislatures in Russia's regions. Stable nomenclature origins are stated to be paramount under current conditions contributing to regionalisation of recruitment base and closure of circles involved.

TI A Russian view on Korean security after the North-South Korea summit
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB For Korea, the year 2000 emerged truly historical. There were events capable of changing relations considerably between the two Korean states and bolstering security on the peninsula. The historical June 13-15 summit will no doubt render essential influence on inter-Korean relations and the situation in the region.
   Now in turn there are the tasks of adaptation of internal and external policy to the North-South rapprochement. Many on both sides are reflecting upon whether there are pan-Korean national interests for the sake of which it be necessary to change all antagonistic practices existing until now in the international arena, and to try to establish inter-Korean cooperation. Clearly, it is the Koreans who must solve these matters independently, as masters of their own country.
   Some foreign observers did not assume that the Pyongyang summit would be so significant. Moreover, they have felt for the first time that Korean national interests and priorities could well exceed ROK alliance responsibilities. The political leaders on the peninsula have denied all pessimistic forecasts from the experts and have shown ability and determination to change the course of events in the interests of the nation and peace in Korea. It instills hope that Korean summits will continue well into the future. But if the Koreans really want to pull together, and even unite, they will be compelled to correct internal and external policies. Such updating might be unexpected for Korea's neighbors, and we are probably beginning to notice it already.

The paper will examine how the fundamentalist interpretation of the Quran may affect the non-state actors' terrorist approach to the cyber domain, the dangers of an assault and the possible side-effects in politics, international relations and the public domain. The author will approach the issue in political, legal and social terms, touching only slightly on issues such as espionage and inter-state relations. Examples of recent cyber attacks and probable future scenarios will be examined to produce a balanced US-oriented policy paper. Some problems are difficult to tackle and require time, skills and diplomacy, but this should not act as an abandonment of initiatives. Although the threat is not yet acute, it is worthwhile addressing at an early stage and preventing the vast harm that can be caused by cyber terrorism. Legislative and political initiatives should be advocated ensuring better cooperation and collaboration between parties.

DE obraz; image; brand and country
AB Separate investigations in the field of country imagology in Russian-language researches are systematized in the article. The whole volume of different investigations in the present subject area is classified. Fundamental notions (conception, image, brand) are defined on the investigations of key methods.
   The whole of investigations are divided into several key directions depending on the goal, determinate results, methods and general tone of investigation:
   The author marks out psychological, culturological, marketing, theoretical, sociological investigation methods of country imagology, as well as method related to cooperation with mass media.
   Image, conception and brand are different things, but they may be used as interchangeable things depending on investigation type. After analyzing examined materials some assertions are offered:
   1. It is quite notable that notions image/conception/brand are often considered not in a set, but in pairs. image/conception and image/brand.
   2. Notion conception is usually used in theoretical and culturological or philosophical contexts, brand is usually used in utilitarian and practical contexts, and image in all the contexts, it speaks about its "median" meaning.
   3. Conception is often related to present and independently established views, image is often related to present, but constructible views on the whole (in the various areas, fields of activities), while brand is often related to fields of economics, tourism and practical marketing.
   4. There are numerous definitions of image by using conception, but there is not a single definition of conception described through image.
   A conclusion can be drawn concerning content and correlation of notions image, conception and brand of country. The most common concept (even if authors have been avoiding conceptualization) is a concept where conception of a country is considered as the most general category embraced all views about country - from philosophical analysis to applied investigations. In this case country image is narrower notion and it means a conception which is tried to influence on in order to change it. Country brand means realization of positive features of the country for the purpose of earning profit. And, on the one hand, it draws brand with image, on the other hand, it marks off them regarding the areas and realization goals.

AB Austrian and German sources show that some "King of Russia" also participated in the Battle of Leitha (June 15 1246) between the King of Hungary Bela IV and Duke Frederick II of Austria. The author of the article comes to the conclusion that this "King of Rusia" was the Galician-Volynian Prince Daniel Romanovich. In late March or early April 1246 Daniel returned from a trip to the Horde of Batu Khan. It wasa then that the prince received the offer of the Hungarian King to make peace and a military alliance bound by a dynastic marriage. Titled "King of Russia", the Austrian and German chroniclers could only say that the sovereign prince had considerable political influence. Daniel Romanovich was called "King of Russia" in the documents of the Office of the Emporor Frederick II in 1240.

AB Recent advances in social neuroscience show that many social phenomena can be traced back to neural processes. Major limitations and contributions of social neuroscience for a better understanding of social phenomena are considered. Social neuroscience is currently guided primarily by psychological notions and theories, thus making it inappropriate for solving sociological problems. Brain research for sociology can be increasingly useful within a branch we call neurosociology. Incorporation of data from cognitive and neuroscience may clarify the low-level structure of social phenomena and contribute to our understanding of social mechanisms. The notion of social status/role is taken as a possible subject of neurosociological research. A number of low-level brain structures and processes are shown to be relevant for the sociological notion of status/role. Examples include findings concerning the possible role of mirror neurons and oxytocin in social cognition and behavior. The idea of modularity is considered as a source of particular neurosociological hypothesis. It is also argued that the study of the neural system may contribute to a better understanding of social categorization, stratification and other macrosociological questions.

Law codes of the ancient East countries, the treatises of the ancient Greek philosophers and medieval thinkers are analyzed. It is also noted that the proponents of economic liberalism (laissez-faire economy), and ones of the idea of paternalism (protection or state trusteeship of the economy) admitted the need for economic security. It is shown that the military power, maintaining of lawfulness and concern for people's welfare remained the key factors in this area for centuries.

Trends in the development of the world system include interaction of the progressive and of the cyclic dynamics, which must be taken into consideration when forecasting global, regional and national transformations. Political cycles in the USA, Russian reforms-counterreforms, European integration trends demonstrate that political development progresses by way of cycles and waves as a means of selecting and affirming new institutions and mechanisms. The problem of convergence and collision of alternative forms of contemporary capitalism is analyzed.

DE Institute of estimation of policy; normative base; target audiences; the
   institutional environment; regulating influence
AB The article considers how the potential of estimation of policy in the SCO member countries (Republic of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Tajikistan, Republic of Uzbekistan and Russian Federation) is being realized. By characterizing forming and developing institute of estimation of policy the prime attention is given to the period and the reasons of an appearance; to allocating stages of development; to the institutional environment (to normative acts, methodical tools); to the types of estimating most actively used; to target audiences; to the mechanism of involvement of the public and experts; to object of estimation (spheres of estimating activity).
   As a result of the short analysis of the situation developed in member countries of the SCO around formation of institute of policy estimation, the author draws a conclusion that these processes gain in each state the national specifics caused not only by strategic objectives of socioeconomic and political development, but first of all, by the directions and results of administrative reforms carried out. Herewith are being preserved certain common problems including insufficient understanding role of estimation both as an administrative tool and as a mechanism of forming civil society. A consequence is a low demand on estimation from the state structures; absence of the national organizations for estimation; a lack of vocational level of the qualified estimators; weak readiness of own methodological base; information isolation of results even of estimating researches carried out etc.

TI "BODY" AND "CORPORAL"
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE body; corporal; body remembers
AB The need for philosophical reflection on scientific evidence of human corporeality makes the problem of man in all the diverse characteristics of its nature and existence an essential element of research activity of the Humanities. Researchers believe that at present not only differentiated analysis of the body as the object and the body as the subject is required, but also an integrative analysis of the totality of its various states, qualities and abilities, united in the notion of physicality. The result is that one of the main research challenges is the question of the ability of modern science to reveal the essence of the phenomenon of human corporeality. In this article we review and analyse different aspects of human physicality in an attempt to prove that the distinction between "body" and "physicality" of cultural studies exists. What is physicality in contrast to body? Primarily, they are distinguished in the measure of "vitality". "Body" generally means, above all, a physical object, which does not possess subjectivity and spirituality. Talking about body, we imagine either natural (body as a biological and physiological organism), aesthetic, or, finally, practical (common understanding of the body) look. In psychology, we do not consider body itself; certain changes in consciousness are associated with body, such as violation of the scheme, borders, or body sensations. The legitimacy of the separation of these concepts is supported by historical linguisticsguistic traditions of various peoples of the world. For example, in the past the word "body" in the Russian language, in addition to its modern meaning, denoted a lifeless thing. Similar examples are found in other linguistic cultures. Also in the structure of the body we can distinguish internal and external components. Internal components (internal living space) are learned through interceptive sensations and feelings. External components (external appearance and living space) are not only perceived, but also seen. A modern trend in the works of Z. Freud, R. Berduaystel, G. Calero, J. Nirenberg, A. Pis, K. Ryukle, J. Fast, R. Sheflen, Giddens, and A. Loewen is to analyse body language and nonverbal aspects of communication between people. Bodily experiences and bodily expression create conditions for distinguishing between external and internal body language. The history of body became a subject of intense study in many branches of the Humanities in medical anthropology. In addition, each theory is not similar in content to other theories, because in one case history of sexuality (M. Foucault), in another. the history of body psychology (V.I. Shkuratov) in the third. history of anatomical and physiological studies of body (G. Glaser) is considered. A major scientific interest for development of human corporeality is the study of political anthropology (A. Deris, O.Yu. Rybakov, S. Espinoza)., derived from the experience of lin

AB In the given article preparation course of Congress on the Siberia Research Institute organization is considered on the basis of archive documents set into a scientific usage for the first time, "Congress works of the Siberia Research Institute organization" and periodicals. The establishment of such an institution was topical for the scientific society of that time. The article represents preparation course of the Congress on the Siberia Research Institute organization, which was considered by contemporaries as a Siberian Academy of Science, once again stressing the significance of that institution for science, especially during such a hard period of Russian history as the Civil War. The idea of such an Institute first appeared during the First Siberian Meteorological Congress taken place in Irkutsk in 1917. Primarily the creation of a special Ministry was planned, but considering difficulties with political life of the country in that period of its history it became impossible. It was Siberia that became the centre to unite all the country, and it was hard to begin such consolidation without a full and serious study of it. The most outstanding public figures of that time took part in preparation course of the Congress and then they became members of the Executive Bureau in Irkutsk and the Organization Committee of the congress members in Tomsk. Different questions and problems stood before organizers and its operatively solving could be followed on the basis of the correspondence data between Tomsk and Irkutsk committees. Lists of members of the Congress, program of their staying in Tomsk, topics of reports, placement questions were coordinated; also different events after the end of the Congress were discussed. Such a great work connected with the preparation course of the Congress was done by these groups, and due to this activity the Congress was financially patronized by the Council of Ministers. The Provisional Statute then discussed on the sectional assemblies was developed during the preparation course of the Congress. The purpose of activity of the Institute, its structure, management system of the Institute and its departments and branch offices were defined in that Statute. The Congress on the Siberia Research Institute organization took place in Tomsk on January 15-26, 1919 under the aegis of the Ministry of Public Education. Thoughts about an extremely unsatisfactory situation with science were repeatedly underlined. The future Siberia Research Institute was aimed to correct it.

AB E.V. Borisov's critical arguments concerning V.A Surovtsev's and V.A. Ladov's researches on rule-following problem are considered in this article. In the first section of the article the theme of foundations of S. Kripke's skepticism concerning rule-following are discussed. The author agrees with Borisov's critical arguments that V.A. Ladov and V.A Surovtsev are not correct in their consideration of foundations of skeptical challenge. However it is emphasized that the authors of "Wittgenstein and Kripke" do not sufficiently expressed their thought. Actually the arguments of Ladov and Surovtsev do not contradict of Borisov's interpretation. In the second section of the article it is asserted that Kripke indeed treated a rule as unambiguously fixed for infinite cases of its application. In this point author of the article does not agree with Borisov's point of view. In the third part of the article it is discussed so-called defect rules. Author asserts that it is not reasonable to say about invisibility of methodological procedures of fixation of standard rule and defect rule. With respect to Borisov's interpretation this section is critical too. Furthermore, E.V. Brisov considers the variant of straight solution of rule-following problem presented in "Wittgenstein and Kripke". The author of this article agrees with critical arguments. However it is emphasized that the research on mathematical induction should be transmit to higher level. Finally, the author of the article estimates Borisov's mode of the straight solution of the rule-following problem presented in his writings. This mode of the solution is acknowledged as sophisticated and very important. It is not doubt that this mode of the solution of the rule-follow problem needs in more careful critical analysis but at the present moment the author of the article does not fix any defects in Boriov's reasoning. This mode of the solution is very important because of different variants of skeptical solution of the rule-following problem prevails in contemporary analytic philosophy. Borisov's solution shows that, at least, we can say about meanings of mathematical symbols as universal and exactly fixed essences.

DE everyday; common sense; intuition; the problem of consciousness
AB Appeal to the theme of common sense, the question of the place and role of his intuitions in philosophical and scientific knowledge is due:
   1) its actualization in modern philosophy, conceptual approaches of which, for solving the problem of consciousness in some cases conflict with the intuitions of common sense;
   2) failure in addressing the everyday context at the level of artificial intelligence;
   3) the advent of a new promising material, applying to the conceptual solution to the problem of consciousness, based on the truths of common sense;
   4) the necessity and possibility of holding its own investigation in connection with the development of hypotheses about the mythical as an inherent property of consciousness of a human.
   Purpose of the article - explanation of the adequacy of the truths of common sense in solving the problem of consciousness. The objects of philosophical analysis are routine and sense of truth in the system of scientific knowledge. Truths of common sense are timeless principles, which are out of the context, of common sense. As a basic methodological installations, the following provisions: everyday is the basis of philosophy and science; ordinary notions of truth and common sense are a necessary part of scientific knowledge. In philosophy everyday is understood as: reality; everyday consciousness; sphere of birth of the truths of common sense; natural or ordinary language. There are substantial and functional interpretations of everyday. The first method of interpretation allows us to see the world of everyday as a primary and autonomous reality, as the foundation of everything. Functional approach reveals the destiny of everyday life: to establish the relationship between reality and knowledge of her knowledge and language, language and reality. Establishing these relationships, everyday provides a whole system "a reality and consciousness." From a phenomenological point of view of everyday is its myths, its history. A man, who doesn't introspect, in search of meaning gives rise to myths and mythic justification. Everyday is a kind of whole mythical space. Its truth is the rational core of everyday knowledge, which does not depend on the context. Specificity of the truths of common sense - the criteria of their truth: people do not know how they knows the truth of judgments of common sense, but it is their belief in truth is the witness of their truth. This situation is typical for a myth-making consciousness: no sufficient justification in the fact that this is so, but the belief is there. The role of the truths of common sense in the concepts of solving the problem of consciousness involves response to a number of other questions: the truth of common sense destroy the myths of everyday consciousness, or serve them a rational basis? If the participation of the truths of common sense in scientific knowledge is inevitable, what the consequences will be?

DE concept; idea; mind; thinking
AB In article the notion of concept is considered. It is a new object of research for philosophy. The notion of concept has arisen in Russian linguistics in the 20th century. Gradually it began to get into other branches of scientific knowledge, including philosophy. The problem of concept is a problem of how people think. We show there is a tradition of the analysis of thinking in classical philosophy, modern western philosophy and Russian philosophy which conducts to the idea of concept. Positions of Abelard, Kant, Hegel, Frege, Deleuze and Guattari, Russian authors are analyzed. In article it is shown that the philosophical thought in the face of these philosophers was moving to the idea of concept. After a historical and philosophical analysis we give a philosophical understanding of the notion of concept. According to it concept is a fundamental and original form of human thinking that has in the basis both cognitive and perceptual experience. In conclusion, the main problems which arise with the introduction of the notion of concept are considered. These are such problems as distinction concept and notion, a way of life concept (its relation to consciousness and language). The basic criterion of distinction of concept and notion is ability to make definition. If we can make exact definition of a word we have the notion; if we can't give definition we have the concept. We can define the notion, because it reflects the general structures. Concept represents a specific individual experiences. We also show that concept exists at four levels: consciousness - the author's text - the interpreter text - collective consciousness. The existence of concept at different levels solves the problem of the relation of concept, consciousness and language. Thus, concept is the medial structure having subjective-objective character. It exists both in the individual mind and in the language of the ethnic group. Concept is the fundamental form of thinking, first of all, ordinary thinking and philosophical thinking.

AB The article analyzes the actions of the Soviet government to reform the school system in the USSR in 1917-1930 years. During this period the foundations were laid for the creation of the Soviet education system, the goals and benchmarks were outlined, to which the state adhered during the formation of the Soviet school. As at the present time the reforms of educational system are conducted in Russia, it is relevant to study the innovation experience that our country has in this field. The main research question is to clarify the evolution of the school system, which was the basis for the emergence of the school model, the modernization of which is being carried out from the 1990's. To answer this question it is necessary to analyze the main aspects of the educational reform undertaken in the period under review. The following aspects can be highlighted: structural-organizational, staffing, class, ideological, methodological and substantial aspects. Consideration of each of them will form an overall picture of reform, the main tasks and goals - declared and actual, will help to analyze the actions of major subjects in reform.

AB The article examines the formation of academic reputation in Russian sociology (and ultimately the state of the Russian sociology) through citation analysis of selected Russian sociological journals. Citation analysis focuses on two parameters: institutional affiliation of the authors and the citation preferences of institutions. The results suggest that the field of sociological publication in Russia (reflecting and reproducing the field of Russian sociology) is divided in isolated 'segments' with few citations between different segments. These segments are built - rather than on theoretical disagreements - both on the administrative principles (academic institutions behind the journals) as well as on geographical factors (mainly Moscow vs. St Petersburg). Ultimately this creates a state of affairs where researcher's reputation is formed within each sociological 'segment' allowing its members to ignore not only the remaining sociological journals, but also other segments.

AB The increase of the role of the state in Russia's economics in the 2000s resulted in restriction of the freedom of business and brought about conflicts between political power and that part of the business world, which sought influence in the world of politics. At the same time arose a complex of questions concerning contradictory relations between business and the broad strata of Russian society. Business does not show sufficient readiness to assume its part of social responsibility. This complex of questions is studied by a new discipline - economic political science. It is the most general features of the authorities' interaction with business in Russia, as well as the difficulties in the process of the said interaction, that are considered in the article.

SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite constant fluctuations between tensions and detente on the Korean peninsula, the crisis in 2010, including the Cheonan sinking and the Yeonpyong Island shelling has proved to become the most dangerous in decades-without obvious new reasons or new contradictions to justify it. After President Lee Myung Bak's coming to power in South Korea, Pyongyang developed suspicions over his new hard-line stance and demands for denuclearization. North Korea thought that Seoul's call for reforms were merely a cover to undermine their regime and it took seriously the desire by Southern conservatives for "early reunification" and thus resorted to military provocations. Meanwhile, the U.S. Obama administration chose to abstain from any meaningful policy toward North Korea, while China played a more active role in supporting Pyongyang and Russian policy, which is based on the priority of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. All issues should be decided by political and diplomatic means without the use of force, threats, pressure, or isolation. Improvements in North-South relations, DPRK dialogue with the West, and a multilateral format are essential prerequisites for realizing a new security system in Korea that takes into account the interests of all parties. Only this can avert a new crisis. The author suggests a return to engagement and the promotion of slow evolutionary changes in North Korea by giving the current ruling elite tangible guarantees of security on the condition that the North would change its domestic and international behavior.

AB The article discusses the relationship between value orientations of the Right-wing extremists with their personal qualities. The main emphasis was made on their relationship with the hostility feelings. The obtained results confirm the authors' hypothesis about Right-wing extremists holding different value orientations from those of the young people of the same age group, who do not express right-wing political views. Value orientations showed weak correlations in the extremists group compared to the control group. The level of "physical aggression" was higher in the extremists group, whereas components of "anger" and "hostility" were on the same level with the control group or even lower. The observed level of hostility was extremely decreased in the study, but related to it values factors were increased. The decrease in hostility authors explain by the specifics of the research procedure, but also by the increase of some values parameters that were negatively correlated with hostility.

AB The article discuses the notion of state agency in world politics using the structuration theory and the transformation model of social action. The state agencial power is divided into three analytically distinct parts: state as an actor, normative system of world politics and state power. This model helps qualify the political agency of three different types of state (modern, postmodern, and premodern state) and their involvement in the governance of world political economy characterized by neoliberalism and market-preserving federalism.

DT Article
AB Throughout the modern period, the state has been an instrument of bringing the cultural and political boundaries in accordance with one another. The state's claim of sovereignty ensures that cultural differences present themselves as national, i.e. as differences between the states, whereas the cultural differences within a state are regarded as insignificant. With globalization, the state loses its ability to maintain a homogeneous cultural space. It no longer has the power to neutralize the demand for difference coming from both cultural communities on the subnational level and from transnational structures. The fictitious nature of the claims of cultural sovereignty, however, does not eliminate the reality of such claims.

DE Philosophy of history; historical studies; narrative; historical
   narrative; temporality
AB This article is intended as a contribution to discussion of problem of place and functions of narratives. It discuss of idea of phenomenologist David Carr about continuity between narrative and "real world". The key view of this author is that the historical narratives will reveal themselves to be not distortions of, denials of, or escapes from reality, but extensions and configurations of its primary features. It means that the historians' thematization exists because historians live in a milieu in which a very general story already exists as a pre-thematic narrative context. William Dray, one of the critics of this view, says that this position is not good paradigm for explanation of nature of historicity of human being and conditions of birth of historiography. I think that it necessary to subscribe to opinion of Carr about continuity between narrative and "real world". But it is not a reason to suppose that the historical narratives are mirror of "real world". Our thesis is that historical narratives will reveal themselves to be not reconstructions or configurations of past, but reconfigurations of narratives of social reality or primary narratives that constitute the "real world".

TI The Russian ruling elite in the political crisis of 1730
SO CAHIERS DU MONDE RUSSE
LA French
DT Article
AB This article studies the Russian ruling elite's social characteristics and self-identification between the late seventeenth century and the first third of the eighteenth. How did the participants of the 1730 political crisis perceive the structure of society? How did they define their "self-identity"? Analysis of the way in which they viewed their own social group shows that the composition of the gentry did not conform to the official Table of Ranks and reveals a parallel unofficial structure which the aristocracy tried to fix legislatively through bills proposed by verkhovniki (members of the Supreme Privy Council). This informal structure consists of three groups: the aristocracy (famil'nye, i.e., representatives of the old Muscovite elite who had kept key posts in government), the middle nobility (dobroe shliakhetstvo, successors of the Muscovite and provincial nobilities), and the petty nobility (podloe shlialchetstvo, the poor nobility dependent on the autocrat and the patronage of famil'nye). In fact, this informal structure was more real for the people of the first half of the eighteenth century than the formalized system of ranks, which had not yet made its way into mentalities.

TI COADJUTER'S WAR AND POZVOL TREATIES OF 1557
SO STUDIA SLAVICA ET BALCANICA PETROPOLITANA
LA Russian
DT Editorial Material
AB The article deals with the so-called "coadjutors' war" and the treaty of Pozvol (1556-1557), which directly prefaced the great struggle for Livonia during the Livonian war (1558-1583).
   By the middle of the 16th century the Livonian confederation was gradualy tottering to its fall, engaging the neighbouring powers into diplomatical, political and ad extremum military strife to carve up the Livonian legacy. Albrecht of Brandenburg was probably the one to launch this contest with his elaborate plan to secure polish-prussian interests in the region. The plan involved an appointment of Christopher of Mecklenburg to the post of coadjutor of the Archbishop of Riga and hence aimed to destabilize the sensitive balance between the Order and its arch-rival. The inner disputies within the confederation and the Order itself resulted in civil disturbances and brought Livonia on the brink of a hopeless war with Poland and GDL. After futile attempts of Danish intervention the matter was finally settled down through the mediation of legates of the Holy Roman Empire.
   Though "the story has been fully told before" (W. Kirchner), the authors draw on some new sources referring primarily to the concluding stage of the negotiations, which were crowned with signature of Pozvol agreements. Thus new light is shed upon hitherto neglected aspects of the problem such as significance of financial claims of Sigismund August and actual role of the imperial mediators. Once more potential contribution of this treaty to unleashing the Livonian war is reconsidered.

DT Article
AB The subject discussed in the article embraces the processes and preliminary results of those changes in the format of the power relations in Russia, that were conditioned by the outcome of the political season of 2007 to 2008. The author judges of the Russian power system as of not so much an institutionalist, but rather a personalist one by its character Further evolution of this political system, in the author's opinion, will be determined not so much by the character of the relations inside the power tandem formed as a result of the 2008 presidential elections, as by development of the general socioeconomic and international situation, as well as by the inevitably coming process of revision of the Constitution, which has been commenced by the prolongation of the terms of authority of President and of State Duma.

TI Barbarity as the Reverse Side of Civilization
SO DIOGENES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article analyzes philosophical discussions on the problem of barbarity as the reverse side of civilization in general, and of the modern civilization in particular (as exemplified by the works of K. Offe, L. Klausen, K.-Z. Reberg, M. Miller, H.-G. Soeffner, S.N. Eisenstadt and Z. Bauman. Joining in these discussions, the author makes a critical appraisal of these works and presents (in brief) her own conception of civilization which she has been elaborating for the last 25 years. Particular attention is drawn to the studies of barbarity implanted in the development of the modern civilization and revealed in the various forms of present-day barbarism (ecological, political, militaristic violence, utter dereliction in daily life, etc.), especially evident in 'outbursts' of violence, suppressing and violating legal rules and moral principles (fascism, totalitarianism, international aggression).

TI The Power Vertical in the Estimation of Regional Elites: Dynamics of
   Changes
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
AB The article contains analysis of the perception, by regional elites and by the regional expert community, of the changes in the system of relations between the Center and the regions that took place in the period of 2000 to 2006. The presented analysis is based on the results of the empirical investigations undertaken in 2004 and in 2006. Comparison of these investigations demonstrates essential difference in the reception of the Center's novelties by the regions. In 2004, the estimations, on the part of regional leaders, of the strengthening of the Center's powers were mainly negative. In 2006 the elite's representatives manifest themselves more positively in the estimation of the Center's policy, holding that the power vertical is rather a pragmatic construction, not so much dangerous as remunerative. Rapidly growing in their milieu is the number of supporters of the vertical, who are gradually learning to derive from it economic and political advantages, to secure influx of additional financial means into regions.

LA Russian
DT Article
AB It is the main problems and contradictions related to political and civilizational self-identification of modern Russian society that are considered in the article. On the basis of analyzed data of sociological polls it is demonstrated that political identity of most citizens of Russia in recent years is blurred and uncertain. Left-centrist political orientations are relatively wide-spread, but at the same time, about two thirds of Russians are not supporters of any political parties. What is characteristic of Russians' civilizational self-identification is domination of the ideas that Russia belongs neither to the West nor to the East, but is a country with a "special way" of development.

It was regional administrative and political elites that turned out to be the priority object of research. The object of the research in the course of the mass poll turned out to be: the population's idea and knowledge of modern elites; estimation by the population of the efficiency of the modern Russian elites' activities; existing ideas of measures to improve the modern elites' composition and to secure efficiency of their activities.

TI The "signifier and the signified": The notion of "constitution" in
   Russian political discourse before and after October 17, 1905
SO CAHIERS DU MONDE RUSSE
LA Russian
DT Article
AB This article analyzes a set of problems related to the meaning, both general and contextual, of the notion of "constitution" which was at the center of intense interpretative thought, bitter political battles and ideological speculations both in "social" and governmental circles before, during and after the 1905-1907 Revolution.
   The term constitution and its derivatives played a complex, thought-provoking and sense-producing role in nineteenth-century Russian political discourse. However, during the revolution and more particularly after the release of the Manifesto of October 17, it became possible to consider the question of constitution both in a purely speculative manner and a new, "practical," light. "Has Russia become a 'constitutional' state and if so, in what sense and to what extent?" This is how the question, that political men in those years sometimes answered in unexpected and paradoxical ways, could be formulated.

DT Article
DE indigenous peoples; population census; ethnic categories construction;
   indigeneity; Russia
AB This article is a case study of the emergence and construction of politically salient social classifications that underpin such phenomena as ethnicity and nationalism in contemporary Russia. Official recognition of ethnic group in Russia often entails political visibility and special status with an associated set of legal provisions. In addition to 'titular peoples' of the republics, the Russian legal system has several legal categories based on ethnicity, such as indigenous peoples and national minorities, whose members claim and attain special status and associated rights. In order to ensure these rights, the state administration needs reliable information on the numbers of people in such categories.
   The article analyzes ethnic and languages categorization in the population census of 2002, describes the related census technology, comments on legal definitions of indigenous peoples in Russia, and within this framework elaborates on the topic of indigeneity construction. It also provides an interpretation of the numerical threshold employed in federal laws on indigenous peoples.

TI Contested autonomy. On the situation of sociology in today's Russia
SO BERLINER JOURNAL FUR SOZIOLOGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB The autonomy of sociology as a science is not simply a question of freedom or liberation from political restrictions in teaching and research. Neither can it be reduced to the problem of its unrestricted organizational establishment. At least as important is the development of scientific classifications without which the epistemological breach between non-scientific and scientific discourse could not be sustained. Based on the French tradition in the sociology of knowledge and science from Durkheim to Bourdieu, this analysis seeks to establish if and to what degree current Russian sociology in its understandings of its applications, objects and methods could liberate itself from the guidelines and structures set forth by the purely political-administrative institutionalization of the field in the Soviet union of the 1960s. The analysis of the disciplinary field considers administratively prominent representatives and their (institutionalized) theoretical-methodological positions which shape the textbook canon up to the present day. For the Soviet/Russian sociology from the 1960s to the 1990s and notwithstanding the serious historical and political changes, the findings suggest a very high degree of personnel and disciplinary continuity. The translation of political differentiations into sociological categorizations is still dominant and represents the "common sense" of the discipline. Thus, post-soviet sociology remains characterized by incomplete professionalization.

AB From the October Revolution until the dissolution of the USSR, emigration for political or ethnic reasons was an integral part of Soviet history. Immigration, on the other hand, was for the USSR relatively unimportant. Four waves of emigration can be distinguished. The first wave of emigrants found a new home in Europe, and later the USA became the preferred destination. Europe has only become more significant again as a destination for emigrants from the Russian Federation since the end of the Soviet Union.

DT Article
AB "Elite and age" (by Ol'ga Kryshtanovskaya and Yuri Khutorianski) is based on 15-years long studies of Russian elite. Generation changes are reviewed against the background of social political events, as well as elite formation processes. New non-Nomenklatura based ways to enter elite and channels of elite recruitment are described. Following elite cohorts are found operationg on recent Russian scenery: Brezhnev-, Gorbachev-, Eltsyn-, and Putin-time. Age differences among the cohorts are estimated with relation to spheres of public politics. Chances for young people careers in top executive and legislative bodies are discussed along with age differences related to educational levels and previous career patterns. New forms of 'elite retirement' are elucidated, as well as eventual activities of 'elite members in retirement'. Certain principles of elite lives are formulated.

AB The article is concerned with the features of Stalin's repressions study by Soviet, emigrant and modern Russian researchers. Accurate data, concerning the number of political prisoners was not published in the Soviet period and special works on this problem were issued only under perestroika. But primarily the wish to "say the truth" about the real dimension of Stalin's crimes was not corroborated by historical sources. It resulted in overstated numbers of tens of millions of Soviet citizens being imprisoned and millions being shot. In recent years the researchers have made a great step forward in studying different types of terror and categories of political prisoners, mechanisms of mass repressive acts execution, dynamics of prisoners number in places of confinement, total number of exiles and deportees. The issue of Books of Condolence in the constituent units of the Russian Federation, the establishment of the Common Database of the Victims of Political Terror in the USSR took the problem research to a new level.

DE culture; conclusion; evolution; unit of selection
AB The article discusses the origin of consciousness and human creativity in the works of contemporary Anglo-American philosophers and naturalists. Attempt to analyze the problem of the evolution of culture and consciousness. The theoretical basis of this paper is the theory of gene-culture co-evolution, developed in detail by E. O. Wilson, R. Dawkins, S. Blackemore, R. Allot and others, as well as the philosophical ideas of D. Dennett, the patriarch of American philosophy, in particular, his "Multiple drafts model". It is suggested that the basis for the evolution of consciousness and the cause of culture (both material and spiritual) is the human capacity for imitation. The beneficiary of the evolution of culture is not the man himself, but the smallest units of culture - Memes are capable of copying themselves, preservation and dissemination. Evolution and culture in need of a connecting element, which acts as the language. The language in the treatment of S. Blakemore and R. Allot, is a complex coevolving memes. It allows intelligence to realize itself through the implementation of ongoing activities of the narrative. Consciousness is regarded not as an objective given, but rather as a property or state of mind, controlled by the positive feedback the evolution of memes. Any evolution involves selection, and memes are selected on the criterion of Darwinian survival (save in culture). Biological evolution as implemented in the interests of "selfish genes" (R. Dawkins) and cultural evolution - in the interests of memes, not people. We are not the source of changes in our own culture - this is the basic idea of S. Blackmore. Partly, it accepts and D. Dennett, making the reservation: "Even if you think that the Darwinian fitness improvement is the principle that drives the evolution of culture, you have to postulate a direct mechanism for the preservation and transmission of information." As such, a mechanism he calls consciousness, which serves as a "Intuition's Pump." As a result, the author concludes that the processes of evolution of consciousness and culture that went parallel in human history, are interdependent, or as figuratively said E.O. Wilson, "the genes hold culture on a short leash." Biological and sociocultural evolution is part of the overall development process, guiding factor which is the ability to simulate and creativity, and a necessary (but not sufficient) condition - developed mind and consciousness.

AB The article specifies that multiple aspects of the ideological heritage of Siberian regionalists can raise the question of allocation of the dominant ideas in it genome. Determination of regionalism as a social phenomenon, organically synthesized complexes views uplift and political persuasion, it is important for the reconstruction of the system-core oblastnicheskoy ideas. It is shown that regionalism and even for themselves the ideologues of the Siberian patriotism is, first and foremost, a social movement kulturtregerskogo order. However, to address the unique "cultural problems" regionalists developed programs of political development in the region. With this purpose, self-worth and underscored the universal relevance of popular sovereignty as the basis for future economic prosperity and social and cultural development of society "under the banner of freedom and independence". It is established that the very state of humanistic thought of Siberian intelligentsia regarded as allied set of regions, each with its own local interests. which are closely connected with the interests of nation-wide. Therefore, the most fruitful political form of "people's lives," they recognized only the Federation, as in a federal democratic state organization of the country's population and it is possible an adequate, full-bodied and full cultural development themselves "the people's provincial started." In general, the article shows that the idea of immanent oblastnicheskoy emphasis on the cultural component, as its developers are not having legal opportunities for full development of their union-federalist project changes, in adverse political conditions, just had to choose the most optimal in terms of the direction of activity. That the only possible area of practical application of their creative powers is their only kulturtregerstvo and enlightenment in the widest sense of those terms. Therefore, it is kulturnichestvo regionalists was actually the main driver for them momentum. Accordingly, it should be considered and a key component oblastnicheskogo attitude. However, it is clear that the political program of the leaders of the movement was oblastnicheskogo synthetic part of their ideological work.

AB The article deals with the unique possibilities of university cities external positioning. The study has been conducted in the context of the predictable reduction of cities in quantity, both in Europe and in Russia, and the survival struggle when city brand becomes the most important resource. Speaking of a university city, the successful area brand promotion is supposed to take into account the most important components such as image marketing, sightseeing marketing, and personality marketing. The author reveals the role of past, present, and future in the effective positioning and the socialization of the students coming to the university city. Special attention is paid to the visual policy as it precedes direct contact, shapes reality perception, and evokes the atmosphere of city and citizen unity. University city visual policy doesn't come to the perception of the past as a museum exhibit; memory is an active catalyst of the present mastering and the future planning. A considerable part of the article is dedicated to the description of a university city image. Thus, the author analyses visual components of university city sites; he reveals the advantages and disadvantages of external positioning of these exceptional areas in the world wide web. The up-to-date and practice-relevant nature of the article is determined by the references to the experience and problems of promoting Tomsk as a university city.

AB In philosophy of culture there is a submission about cultural and historical type as a unified cultural and civilizational formation. This conception assumes that culture is objectification of such components of human nature like striving for search of sense of one's existence, belief, beauty, truth, sacrifice; civilization is a relevance of requirement in confirmation its successful, safe, firm existence in given world.Determination of civilizational components as cultural components means that any phenomenon of cultural and historical type is a unity of civilizational and cultural aspects with culture aspect determination. Specific character of cultural aspect of morality means that moral values exist transcendentally as ideal reference points, common standards, setting universal people connection. Moral ideals determine civilizational values, which can have situational character, can be measured by their practical advisability.Cultural determination clearly be displayed on a level with ancestral forms of culture. The high purpose of the science is devotion to the Truth first of all, and man's comfort in this world after all. Cultural determination can be implicit. As a rule, cultural determination is implicit on a level with private, single and within the limits of concrete activity. In this case cultural component is necessary constituent part of active process and becomes actual in aim (the aim is considered as an transcendental aspect) and in self sensation of devotion.Cultures, cultural epochs which have transcendental dominants on the polar positions either predominate or escape from mental kernel. Cultural epochs begin to reflex at their mental dominants. It can also serve as a confirmation of cultural determination of civilizational phenomena. It can also prove cultural determination of civilizational phenomena.In general, the image of civilization is determinated by cultural values. Only in modern global world the aspiration for a single civilization can be called strategic, but this aspiration can not be universal because of determination by cultural values. Look of the modern world proves it

DE installation; approach; a paradigm; methodology; algorithm of research;

AB In solving of problem of consciousness there is a number of obstacles of a methodological origin. A serious methodological obstacle is the situation which has developed concerning ordinary representations about consciousness, obviously or implicitly present at philosophical solutions of a problem of consciousness. On the one hand, they are considered as indicators of adequacy of this or that conceptual approach, and on the another hand - as aspiration to ignore them. Thus absolutization of a role of trues of common sense in the decision of philosophical problems leads to return result-deprives understanding of philosophical consciousness, and categorical ignoring of installations of common sense in solution of a problem of consciousness - makes them extravagant, conflicting to steady ordinary representations about consciousness, transforms philosophical interpretations of consciousness into gamble. Initial methodological position of the given research - trues of common sense are necessary in a philosophical solution of a problem of consciousness. The philosophy isn't capable to exist outside of trues of common sense: presence of trues of common sense at structure of philosophical knowledge makes it perceived on level of ordinary consciousness. The purpose of the article - revealing of essence of methodological problems of research of consciousness, definition of a functional role of intuitions of common sense at level of methodology of research of consciousness.The answer to a question on adequacy of the reference to trues of common sense at the decision of difficult philosophical problems can be found by means of definition of a functional role of intuitions of common sense in consciousness philosophy. The structure "philosophical installation -> the conceptual approach -> the general methodological basis of research -> concrete methodology -> the consciousness theory" represents algorithm of a solution of a problem of consciousness. As an obvious or implicit methodological invariant in this structure the common sense acts: as installation, as a method, as result; as criterion of an estimation of philosophical knowledge.

AB The paper considers argumentation for justification of the preference for the realist position in philosophy in comparison with the anti-realist conceptions. This version of realism is named by the author as a formal realism. As other versions of realism it recognizes the existence of objective reality and the possibility of its comprehension by means of the procedure of correspondence. In other words, the statement is true if it corresponds to the real state of affairs. The specificity of this concept lies in the proposed distribution of priorities. The nature of the objective world has secondary character in relation to the justification of the existence of an objective reality. The main argument is that any statement denying any form of realism is self-inconsistent or self-denying. Moreover, according to the author, the way of the making the anti-realistic statements is based, as a matter of fact, on the principles of realism. Therefore, the author insists that realism is the only point of view, avoiding contradictions like that. We suppose that the basic argument of formal realism contradicts to its own principles. Preference of realism should be proved not by its possibility to avoid contradictions but its ability to show the existence of an objective reality. The argument from consistency is more suitable for the justification of anti-realism principles. We believe that anti-realist should avoid the pitfalls of a discourse of realism when they proclaim their principles. They should not make the propositions which imply establishment of correspondences.

   EVOLUTION
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Soviet science; higher education; intelligentsia; Soviet state
AB The article describes the problems of mutual relations of representatives of scientific and pedagogical intelligentsia and the Soviet power in the 1930s. It was a critical stage both for most domestic intellectuals and for all the Soviet society: the question of the physical survival of the scientific community members and ways of the further development of scientific knowledge and higher education system was solved. By example of Tomsk features of processes of fitting the intellectual stratum in the system of the new Soviet society are analysed. On the basis of destinies of some representatives of Physics various models of forming of relations and interaction with the Soviet state and its practice in science and higher education spheres are reconstructed. The main feature of the considered period is that the practice of mutual relations of the power and the intellectual elite became more and more complicated. On the one hand, direct reprisals took place, on the other - a considerable part of intellectuals organically occurred in the structure of the Soviet society. Another key aspect of the given problem is that the form of the pressure the Party and the governments laid changed slightly: the political campaigns objectively directed against the intelligentsia took the form of ideological discussions with a considerable part of the scientific and pedagogical community participating. An equally important factor was the conditions given by the authorities to representatives of the priority fields of knowledge: the institutional approval of scientific directions, social status, access to material benefits, etc. As a result, during the 1930s it is possible to track two main tendencies characterizing the given period: the final suppression of scientists objectionable to the authorities and gradual adaptation of the other part of scientific and pedagogical community in the new social structure. Thus, the given period may be identified as the time of institutionalisation of the new Soviet science (both literally and metaphorically). The latter tendency led to a certain integration of a part of the scientific elite (first of al - in Physics) in the power institutes of the transformed Soviet society. Tomsk scientific and pedagogical community, with certain regional character, reflected the form and content of the contemporary political and social processes.

DE innovation; socio-humanities; social and cultural aspects of the
   innovation
AB Supporting of the innovation development is one of the priority goals of Russian national strategy. Tasks of the building of national and regional innovation systems, development of the innovation infrastructure, perfection of relevant legislation have (already) been discussing during more than ten years. However there are some questions and problems that have been paid insufficient attention by the innovation community. These questions and problems are connected with influence of innovations to the individual and society. The authors believe that it is necessary to support professional discussion of social and cultural aspects of the idea and practice of the innovative development, to form relevant actual semantic space, to put forward new and original ideas in philosophical, social, cultural and anthropological sphere which would have increased understanding of the innovative type of development and would have minimized social and human risks of the innovation processes.
   Innovation study is described as a new scientific field. This field is interdisciplinary and includes knowledge from economics, management, sociology and other fields of knowledge. Key issues of the innovation study are the technological development and its economic efficiency. There is a lack of understanding of what social and anthropological consequences does innovative development have and what is its impact to the individual and society, country and the world community. There is a need to reconsider following challenges and problems:
   Challenge of the Risk Society. Constant innovation changes and renewals lead to instability and risk as a new norm of life.
   Challenge of the Social Gap. The modernization is fraught with social stratification, when the highly skilled specialists are involved into producing of the innovations, and low-skilled workers are engaged in a manual labor.
   Challenge of the Prognostication of the social effects of the technology development.
   The Problem of the Human Fatigue. For a modern people there is a need to educate and renew knowledge constantly. It leads to the information fatigue and generates new forms of escaping behavior, such as down-shifting, and new forms of resistance.
   The Problem of the Human Simplification. Constant innovations spread rapidly, that can lead to the formation of similar life styles and ways of thinking.
   This article includes analytics of the materials of the XIV Tomsk innovation forum INNOVUS that was held in 2011. The Forum showed that the specificity of the Russian innovation discourse is its ideological genre. As a result social and anthropological problems could not be understood at the proper level.
   Nowadays the subject of innovation activity and its initiator is primarily a state government. That in fact has negative impact into the effectiveness of innovation policy. Innovation rhetoric risks to lose its energy and become a new "ritual language" of the administrative-bureaucratic elite. It was demonstrated on the Forum that there is a deficit of the regional innovation policy actors and authentic regional concepts. The most part of the used examples and concepts is taken from experience of other countries.

AB The article introduces the forms of political and social representation which were specific to the recent Russian civil protests. The analysis is based on numerous interviews with protesters and observation of evolution of the movement. The data put in to question the frequently referenced "crisis" of representation and bring to light a variety of coordination centers set in competition for a political mandate of the protest movement, as far as a vague will of a considerable part of protesters to be represented. Media coverage of the street rallies, including their global attribution to a "middle class", is critically examined along with the protesters' own statements and rallies agenda, in order to check the presence of an actual social or revolutionary representation. The article reveals the way a break with apparatus and hegemonic models of collective action realized in current mobilization provides it with new (in the Russian context) forms of political subjectivity based on self-empowerment and self-test. Non-trivial international comparisons are used in order to specify typological features of the Russian case.

AB The paper focuses upon two samples of early modern "civil sciences": rhetorical inquiry dealing with contingency (so called "rhetorica primaria") and mathesis politica traditionally referring to the intellectual context of early Enlightenment. The study deals with the main tendencies that shaped early Enlightenment political science consisting of criticism of the necessitarian ethical rhetorical paradigm, an appeal to rhetorical competence, search for a way to "tame" contingency and thus to learn how to understand the human will's universe of effects and how to control it. Special attention is paid to the famous "new sciences": Giambattista Vico's scienza nuova and Thomas Hobbes scientia civilis. The fundamental difference in Vico's and Hobbes' theoretical styles is emphasized. While Hobbs is "macro-sociological" ("macro-solution of macro-problems") and handles issues extreme and ultimate, that allow neither interim decisions nor close attention to historical niceties, Vico considers the matter of his science as a universe of contingency, defining scienza nuova as history. Particular attention is paid to the function of the topical-rhetorical discourse in Hobbes' political science, used for the description of the prepolitical man (6th chapter of Leviathan). Drawing upon almost unknown 17th-century Dutch political writings, the study examines ways of the reception of Hobbes' civil science conceived as a rhetorical inquiry. The authors also explore Vico's alternative to Hobbes' constructionist theoretical style. A vast array of contemporary theoretical approaches to the early modern political thought is analyzed, from the "Cambridge history of concepts" to N.S. Struever's "modal rhetoric".

AB The main thesis of the article is that revolution and corruption are structurally and genetically related to the process of state building (etatisation). Basing itself on Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu's ideas on the state, the article demonstrates that revolution and anti-corruption agitation are derived from a "normative pressure", resulting from the generalization of the fiction of raison d'Etat. In the conclusion of the article this thesis is considered in the context of recent protest movements in the US and Russia which impose a demand on the "new norm". The fact that the normative initiative walked away from the governments to protest movements suggests that current models of political representation are undergoing a deep crises.

AB The recent global financial and economic crisis has revealed weaknesses of the Russian model of development in the 2000s. It is doubtful whether the efforts currently under way by the Russian Government to "repair" the existing model without political and economic reforms will lead toward a major improvement of the investment climate as only slight changes are being made (e.g., the improvement of the Russian migration regime and the development of special economic zones). However, the federal elections in 2012 could lead to more efficient steps, although it is difficult to predict the scale of probable positive shifts in the investment climate. This article discusses Russian inward FDI and its policy context.

Mental structures of an actor of the international politics are described. Starting from this point as the basis of medium-term prognostication the method of indicators is suggested. The characteristic feature of this method is combination of scientific approach to, and of expert artistic perception of, political impact.

AB Political representation has its origin in revolution, with its rupture between the constituent and the constituted power. Constituent power is an eventful form of representation. It emerges not out of nothing, but from pre-existing representative institutions of a non-democratic type. In 1989 - 1993, in Russia, the democratic constituent power emerged out of the decorative "Soviets" and was then transformed into a regular parliamentary representative organ, having lost its constituent and radical-democratic character.

AB The article argues that the emergence of capitalist world system has caused collapse of the Christian morality that used to form the basis of value reproduction of political society. It is morality of homo economicus that has become dominant, but in its pure form it is unable to serve as support for the existence of society. The function of compensation of moral deficit for capitalism was transferred to the Modernity political project based on an unperfected alloy (not to say medley) of Christianity and capitalism in the form of liberal consensus of modern ideologies and utopias.

AB The basic transformations of the global society have meant for the contemporary political science the necessity of a methodological reconstruction bound up with broadened conceptions of the global political processes of the 21st century. It seems fair in this context not only to apply interdisciplinary methodology in political science research (which has been actively done for some last years), but also to breathe new life into the philosophical reflection on international relations and world politics. The authors of this article discuss the core characteristics and methodological perspectives of such a new academic discipline as the Philosophy of World Politics - one of innovative and promising sectors in contemporary social science. By this article the authors contribute to the scientific discussion concerning the new discipline and to present the position of the Saint-Petersburg school of world politics as related to the issue.

DT Article
DE Vietnam; S&T and innovation policy institutes; national innovation
   system; transitional economy; policy mix
AB Since the beginning of 1990s the Vietnamese economy has been undergone structural changes that until recently have resulted in fast modernization and GDP growth. Recognizing the need to point economic development towards innovation, the government has undertaken institutional reform. This paper assesses the evolution of science, technology and innovation policy for the last decade in Vietnam, with emphasis on the coherence and efficiency of policy instruments.
   The study shows that despite major steps forward in the formation of a legislative and institutional framework for the national innovation system, there are factors working against it. The mixed character of the Vietnamese economy (combining market institutions with tight public regulation and a significant share of public property) fostered by inconsistent and ineffective policies, discourages the innovation environment and synergy of reforms. There is also a huge gap between policy and implementation. Another factor is difficulties with setting strategic goals and defining policy priorities: policy tasks are overwhelming in number, but also there is overlap. There is no interdepartmental agency able to provide horizontal and vertical co-ordination of governmental initiatives. The bias towards fostering "technology push" as well as preserving dominance of state actors in science and industry is the most important inconsistency; "market pull" based tools remain underdeveloped.
   A new set of measures envisaged by the Strategy of Scientific, Technological and Innovation Development for 2011-2020 provides some opportunity for new policies. The government will need to revise the framework conditions restricting the development of competition, introduce demand-driven and inclusive development oriented tools as well as develop targeted and complementary regulation. Qualitative improvement of institutions requires introducin competitiveness where now economic elites dominate, and this, again, forces into the open the tension between economic pluralism and political monopoly.

DE political psychology; political values; political generations
AB Today the problem of values' content of political reality is actual and is discussed in scientific community. Research of political values of different generations of Russians is based on the concept of R. Inglehart. According to his theory the global shift of values system of humanity from materialism to postmaterializm has occurred. Thus change of values consciousness from materialism to postmaterializm goes from one generation to another. The researches which has been conducted in Russia in the beginning of the 1990s, confirm this notion.
   However, the results of our research show, that the most actualized political values in all generations of Russians today are "values of safety", which are a part of materialistic values (in Inglehart's terminology).
   As a result of verbalization these values are expressed in such concepts as "peace", "order", "legality", "sovereignty", "patriotism", "freedom", "justice". It is neither unusual nor typical for Russia only. This complex of values defines priorities of every democratic state. But there are specific interpretations of these concepts by Russians, caused by features of a life of our country in the last 15-20 years.
   The necessity of peace, order, legality we fixed is a reaction to real living conditions of citizens in transformation's period characterizing by a randomness of public processes, instability of economy, corruption of officials.
   Thus, we can conclude that in a modern Russian society the united system of group political values takes place. The requirement for safety (personal, economic, political), that finds the expression in the values conditionally and is designated by us as "values of safety", is characteristic for all groups of the Russian society without dependence on age. This notion is very important, because, on the one hand, It indicates that there is a deep economic and socio-political crisis in our country, but on the other hand "values of safety" create a content of the Russian political-cultural space.

DE cognitive style of thinking; the matrix; an archetype; a poster; image;

AB A paradox of research subject emanates from the fact, that functional for its intended purpose and at the same time shortly living political poster has not only become one of the most interesting phenomenon of the native political culture, that can be proved by the presence of fundamental Russian and foreign researches diversity, but also has been a picture in political thinking formation, having turned to a peculiar style. Special notice is given to children age with its perceptivity to indoctrination influence. The article is devoted to this problem definition and deals with the sources that demonstrate image thinking having crossed the borders of the visual one. It permeated into children literature, songs etc. In this very case writers, text and music authors acted as constructors of political thinking poster style. They formed an image scheme, the place of which could be conditionally defined in coterminous layer of consciousness and unconsciousness. Resonating, poster style of political thinking itself addressed to innermost consciousness phenomena-archetypes (according to C. Jung definition). In his works Carl Jung paid significant attention to visual schemes of thinking. Causing archaic interpretation scheme, this resonance contributed to the building of stable attitude to such basic phenomena as native land, hero/enemy, feat etc. As it is illustrated in the article, a poster style of political thinking is not exhausted by the brought up in USSR generation, but also appears in modern youth. It brings a research subject from metaphorical supposition to the field of currently central researches and gives a new horizon for progressive study of this problem.

DE political ideology; dynamic system; ideological field; ideological
   processes
AB Research of phenomenon of ideology in the modern scientific literature is interfaced, primarily, to questions of influence of ideological factors on political and social processes. Such dependence becomes clear and obvious in light of tha role played by ideologies in modern societies. Ideology be issued during era of Modernity and defined itself as effective and practically unique mechanism of constructing political reality. With its advent people have been offered the systematized methods of orientation in politics and purposeful activity. All this period ideology were characterized by doctrinal and aspiration to utility. At the same time, researches were carried out some aspects of ideological processes when changes were considered as consecutive in time static conditions of ideological system. However, in modern terms it is not so effective and potential. The modern ideological system no longer has the rigidity of the form and often a fact (and necessity) of its existence is called by researchers into question (as, for example, in the concept deideologization). Complication and at the same time erosion of social reality has introduced the corrective amendments in existence sociocultural phenomena. Today we speak about transformation of ideological forms which come in the stead of dogmatic projects.
   The focus of this article - model of ideology as a dynamic system. Ideological forms are considered as continuously transformed systems. The focus is on the process itself, a continuous stream of changes. The dynamic system is understood by author as sequence of conditions of the spatial structure possessing qualities and characteristics of system. Considered as dynamic system, ideology has the qualities and characteristics of the system as a stream of changing conditions
   In dynamic model the ideology is considered as the environment of ideological attitudes and interactions. The author proposes to use the category of "ideological field", which most accurately reflects the procedural of this phenomenon. Analyzing dynamics of an ideological field, the author comes to conclusion, that levels and measurements of ideological field in aggregate form all context of changes in it. While actually changes in ideological field (as the sequence of events and conditions in time) lead to different conditions of ideological field and define ideological process.

DE authenticity; ideology; social order
AB This article is devoted to the critique of some ideological implications of both the grave German philosophy and literature of the XIX century and perfectly light and popular cultural phenomena as well as daily communications which presented by the book "Jargon of Authenticity' by Theodore Adorno. The article is dealing with the critique of M. Heidegger's existential philosophy and first of all with the main notion of this philosophy which is "Authenticity". This special interest is implicated by the following Adorno's point of view. He values the Heidegger's philosophy as more complicated and subtle than philosophy of O.F.Bollnow, K.Jaspers and other less reputed philosophers and literati. But it does not mean that the Heidegger's philosophy is more "pure". Per contra: the ideological content of the Heidegger's philosophy is more dangerous whereas it is not straightforward, not unsophisticated, not clumsy.
   The Adorno's arguments may be classified to the four categories:
   1. The arguments of absence of pure existential experience. There are exists only social experience. The existential experience is substituted by the experience of the marginal social groups, by the experience of the antecedent ages, by the psychological experience.
   2. The arguments connected with the language of the description of the experience. Adomo considers such language as mythological one. Such language is archaic and provincial. The words of this language break the confines of their meanings.
   3. The arguments connected with the communicative practices. Heidegger doesn't want be comprehended. He pretends to the selectness. The construction of his thought negatives the opponent's position by means of privilege of the question in comparison with the answer.
   4. The arguments connected with the impossibility of the ontologic researches after the Kantian transcendental turn.
   The main Adorno's idea is following: the Heidegger's philosophy confronts to the social order by means of declarations. But it support the social order as a matter of fact. The Heidegger's philosophy substitutes the real suffering, mischief, death by their metaphysical analogs. Thereby the Heidegger's philosophy preserves and absolves the social order.

AB Much has been written on the question of disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and the conflict that followed(1). A lot of scholarly attention was devoted to the analysis of the reasons of the Yugoslav war, political, military, psychological and other aspects of the conflict and ways of conflict resolution. International community responses to the conflict have also been much discussed(2). Post-conflict reconstruction, relations of the Balkan states with the EU, compliance with the EU accession criteria have been extensively covered as well(3). Less attention, however, was given to the process of creation of the International Criminal Tribunal in the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), an institution established to try individuals responsible for international crimes committed during the conflict, cooperation with which is currently one of the most important EU accession criteria for the Balkan states. The ICTY was primarily discussed by legal scholars, who attempted to analyze the impact the Tribunal made on the development of international criminal justice(4). This article attempts to show how historical analogies were used in the process of creating the ICTY. The rhetoric of "war raging at the heart of Europe", threatening to undermine developments in the "new Europe" was frequently employed by politicians in the discussions leading to the creation of the Tribunal.

DT Article
DE discourse; corporation; cognitive science; communication
AB Discourse is an interrelation of three components: the set of texts, the system of communicative acts and the model of world outlook. The texts of the instructional discourse are insufficiently explored nowadays. This research meets the contemporary challenge of fast-paced development of the instructional discourse. The historical period of political system change and transition to the market economy in Russia in 1995 is taken as the relative borderline between the traditional and contemporary instructions. Fast development of instructional discourse is closely related to the galloping development of hi-tech devices, which are those that combine the achievements of several industrial branches of its time. As the result of the instructional discourse analysis three groups of features are being defined: structural, stylistic and communicative. Traditional instructions mostly are printed manuals or user guides whose style is close to the methodological literature with recondite terms. The speech tactics of informing, shifting the burden of responsibility and driving to act are used. The speech genres are as follows: manual, user guide, memo, prescription and directive. The speaker is given the role of either an expert or a teacher; the listener is a professional in need of consulting, or a student, respectively. The strict form of the instruction does not allow switching the communicative role. Contemporary instructions in addition to the paper-printed form exist as elements of software and hardware interface, e-texts and media. The chapters are spread within thematically divided sections, the text is non-linear due to hyperlinks, and the organization of instructional material is automated (WEB 2.0). As for the stylistic features, the instructional discourse is enlarged due to inclusion of advertisement discourse components, the use of terms is minimized, the elements of intuitively measured iconic semiotic system are introduced. The communicative features include the use of speech genre of recommendation and prohibition; the latent and verbal pointing to the reader's background knowledge requirements. The development of instructional discourse has come to the idea: to use some object one does not need to know how it works. The following study of the instructional discourse will allow to estimate and to understand the changes in the cognitive and social spheres.

On the contrary our main problem is totality of value of "private", as before it was the totality of value of "common". Civil modernization in Russia would require the development of values for internal limitation of "private interest". It is not enough to just substitute total value of "common" by total value of "private". It is important to transform value of "private interest" from it's paternalistic to civil type.

TI THE FORMATION OF THE POLITICAL ELITE IN LITHUANIA AT THE TURN OF THE
   1980s-1990s: THE ROLE OF "MORAL POLITICIANS"
SO BALTIC REGION
LA English
DT Article
DE Lithuania; transformation; political elite; moral politicians
AB This article considers the trend of structural changes in the political elite of the Republic of Lithuania in the post-Soviet period through analyzing the role of the so-called "moral politicians" - intellectuals, artists, and cultural figures, who played a decisive role in the period of the communist system disintegration and further development of the country's policy.
   The role of the political elite, which is understood according to R. Putnam and J. Higley's definition, is considered in the conditions of political instability and uncertainty typical of transformation processes. In this context, the role of key actors is interpreted on the basis of the methodological structure of the so-called Stanford model developed by G. Almond and P. Bourdieu's theory of capital.
   This article reconstructs the course of political changes in the Republic of Lithuania at the initial stage of its independence, in the framework of which the key role was played by "moral politicians", most of whom subsequently retired from politics.
   Focusing on the situation in Lithuania, this research sets out to show the continuous dependence of today's policies of the Baltic States on the key choices made by the authorities at the turn of 1980s-1990s.
   Today, Russian political science lacks concrete regional studies into the issues of changes of elites in the context of research on the processes of postcommunist transformations. This work addresses the scientific interpretation of the content of mechanisms of "new" political elite development in postcommunist societies under the influence of endogenous and exogenous factors in the course of transformation. The stabilisation of elite formation processes in Lithuania, the assessment of patterns and trends, the identification of power centres and the character of intra-elite interaction, and a profound understanding of the functioning of Lithuanian political system in general will allow Russia to formulate a more efficient policy towards the Baltic States, which would promptly respond to emerging challenges.

TI BEYOND EMPIRE: SPATIAL CONFIGURATIONS OF IDENTITIES IN RUSSIAN LITERARY
   UTOPIAS OF THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
SO AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE
LA Russian
DT Article
AB The article by Mikhail Suslov explores the ways identities were imagined in Russian utopias at the end of the nineteenth century and in the early twentieth century. The author conceives of narrative utopias as forms of political intervention. The article claims that those utopias not only reflected the hegemonic structures of spatial imagination in prerevolutionary Russia but also suggested new ways of development of the geopolitical imagination beyond the imperial and colonial paradigms. At the same time, those utopias reveal self-annihilating contradictions that were a result of complexities and constraints involved in imagining a radically novel political world. Thus, even cosmic utopias with socialist programs reproduced the metanarrative of hegemonic European culture. Only those authors of utopias who lived through catharsis in the form of real or literary catastrophe and disillusionment could transgress the conventions of imperialist pleasures and imagine " communities of trauma." These latter types of utopias refracted features of Slavophilic messianism. In the literary imagination, the community was envisioned by authors as founded on national homogeneity or a pan-national (pan-Slavic) federation. Suslov concludes that the consolidation of post-imperial society as portrayed in those utopias may be understood as a result of the process of internal decolonization. The article pays close attention to political projects by S.F. Sharapov, who was a prominent neo-Slavophile publicist and author of works of fiction. Sharapov's works clearly demonstrate how the internal logic of Russian fin-de-siecle utopias necessarily led to the reduction of inner contradictions in the dynamically modernizing imperial society and to the self-liquidation of utopia as a literary genre.

AB Qualitative methods are ever wider adopted in political science. The fact may be explained by distinctive features both of the qualitative paradigm and of the object of political science - political reality. One of the methods of the qualitative paradigm that has received wide recognition, is media-political discourse-analysis. Norman Fairclough's three-dimensional model of critical discourse-analysis helps to avoid some typical mistakes of a discource researcher. Illustrated (as example) with Internet-media analysis of a communication, this model demonstrates its own wide research potential extending far beyond the limits of concrete discourse practice.

DT Article
DE Dagestan; Qajar Persia; Avars; Emir Aliskandi; Iskandar Mirza
AB It is known that the Qajars had their supporters in Dagestan during the Russo-Persian Wars in the early 19th century. This fact is well documented in Persian chronicles and royal decrees (firmans), as well as in the materials from the Russian archives. However, the number of historical documents originating from the region itself is drastically few.
   This paper presents three letters in Arabic, without dates, but definitely from the same period, illustrating the political situation of the time in the mountains of Dagestan and the geographical extent of the Qajar influence in the area. The letters were discovered recently in the Archives of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, Dagestan Centre, Russian Academy of Sciences in Makhachkala. The English translation is accompanied by the facsimile reproduction of the original texts, and commentaries.

AB The author exposes the insufficiency of the methodology. now dominant in political science both in the West and in our country, for relevant analysis of problems of the formation of civil society and of citizen. Possibility of overcoming the one-sidedness of institutionalism implies methodology of socio-cultural analysis. This methodology helps synthesize the methods of synergetics, the conceptions of global history and of sociology of knowledge. As the basis of the synthesis comes the principle of mutual complementariness of the social and of the cultural, of the stable and of the variable. of the universal and of the local.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Civil; public; municipal law; Roman provinces
AB In this analytical outline of the history of Roman law in Spain from the 2nd c. BCE to the 6th c. CE, the author notices that even in the 2nd century BCE Roman legal and political institutes exercised so great influence on the Republican's allies in Spain, that the emerging provincial government adopted almost all their characteristic elements, including the majority of public regulations, legal proceedings, and language. Narrative and epigraphic evidences leave no doubt that already by the beginning of the Common Era the municipal law in Spain had effectively copied and assimilated all public and private Roman legal institutes. The most active involvement of the Spanish in Roman politics (including the Roman emperors descending from this region) helped the province to become an important propagator of Roman legal and political tradition to the rest of the western world, whilst the consequent assimilation of the Goths (Roman allies for more that a century) made Spain the last outpost of roman law in Europe until the Arabian invasion, and the Breviarium of Alaric is a good evidence to this process.

TI THE SECOND RUSSIAN CENSUS: CATEGORIZATIONS OF POPULATION AND IDENTITY
   POLITICS
SO AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE
LA Russian
DT Article
AB Sergei Sokolovskiy, the guest editor of this discussion, speaks as an expert on population diversity who participated on the team of researchers preparing "instruments," including lists of nationalities and languages, for the censuses of 2002 and 2010. Commenting on the issues raised by other participants in this discussion, he explains the rationales behind the choices made by his team of experts and examines the consequences of different decisions made by the Russian state. The initial intention to postpone the census from 2010 to 2013 and then the reversal of this decision led to the interruption of financing for preparing the census. This, in turn, prevented a major revision of the questionnaire in a way that would allow respondents to express and register multiple identities. The article examines in detail another aspect of the unimplemented revision that concerns the linguistic program of the census. Sokolovskiy provides insider-information on, and professional analysis of, the exclusion from the questionnaire of questions pertaining to confessional identity. The bulk of the article deals with the ethnic classifications composed by the expert team of the Institute of Ethnography and Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Sokolovskiy explains the mechanisms for selecting ethnic denominations and for calculating the results of the census, and claims that breaking up large national groups into smaller units has a different rationale than the political implications usually derived from it by national activists. In showing how the population policy embedded in the 2002 and 2010 censuses differed from the earlier patterns of nominating groups of nationalities, he refers to the history of Soviet censuses and highlights instances that have led to the mobilization of ethnicities and national conflicts. Finally, Sokolovskiy turns to the latest tendency to dismiss the census as a major instrument for studying population and considers arguments pro and contra.

SO AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE
LA Russian
DT Article
AB The essay by Sergei Sokolovsky explores the relationship between the concept of indigeneity as it is practiced in autochthonous, nationalistic, and indigenous claim making and identity politics and the more respectable spheres of production of regulatory norms and knowledge, such as international law and biomedical sciences. Sokolovsky begins his essay with an analysis of the concept of the indigenous, aboriginal, and autochthonous as modern discursive formations. With the help of political theorist Jeremy Waldron, the author unpacks the essential contestation in the definition of indigeneity. There are two contradictory models: one is based on the claim of first settlement on a given territory and the utilization of land resources; the other defines indigeneity as the preceding social and political order in relation to colonial rule by Europeans. Sokolovsky demonstrates that even though the second model is applied in the system of international law, it is paradoxical because many peoples who are defined as indigenous according to this model were the conquerors of their territories in the distant past. Sokolovsky contends that these contradictions in international law arose as a result of the problematic epistemology of the discourse of indigeneity. The author further discusses how this problematic epistemology is transferred to biomedical sciences and the international program of containment of invasive species. Sokolovsky demonstrates the resemblance of the biology of invasive species and environmental thinking to the discourse of sociocultural nativism and xenophobia. The author then applies the critique of nativism and indigeneity from social sciences to the analysis of discursive formations in contemporary biomedical sciences. With the help of environmental studies of Hawaii, he shows that many premises of the biology of invasive species are based on flawed assumptions about indigeneity taken from cultural and social constructions.

AB In Japan the process of foreign policy decision-making is characterized by the priority role of executive power. Especially strong is the role of separate ministries competing among each other, while the coordinating function of the cabinet of ministers is comparatively weak. Along with that, the influence of public opinion has recently become much more evident, which to a large extent can be explained by the growing role of populism as an important political resource of the incumbent administration.

DT Article
DE knowledge; cognition; epistemology; functionalism; relativism
AB Knowledge is difficult to define unambiguously, as is shown by existing disagreements in philosophy of epistemology. The problem may be traced down to differences in purposes and ideologies of epistemological investigations. The author supposes that unlike the tradition to take the question about the nature of knowledge, and the one about its scope as inevitably tied together, the later question may be answered separately. This can be done within the functionalist framework where knowledge is to be determined not by linguistic, psychological, social or other features of forms of knowledge, but by epistemic functions of what is ordinarily presumed to be known. What is epistemic function becomes the main question under these lines of investigation. Consistently provided it seems to make knowledge a highly relativized notion. Hence the general concern of the author is whether this price is worth paying.

TI Ethnic minorities and nation-building in the post-Soviet space:
   Constructing a theoretical framework
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
AB Divisions over recognition of Kosovo, Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence put in focus policies towards ethnic minorities, structuring and legitimization of power in newly-formed multi-ethnic states. In most cases state-building requires the homogenization of population, i.e. "nationalizing" policies of both exclusion and inclusion. The relevant European experience has been conceptualized by political scientists examining the key parameters of "nationalizing" policies used in respect of ethnic minorities as well as the influence of centre-periphery polarity and different ways of political control maintenance on the process of state- and nation-building. Applying these approaches to the post-Soviet realities the authors offer a theoretical framework for analyzing grounds, forms and consequences of the politicization of ethnicity and evaluation of possible stability/instability, including secessions, bringing a realistic perspective to bear on what is happening and what can be done.

AB A dynamic model of morphological analysis of complex-compound conflicts (CCC) is proposed in this article for description and systemic study of the complex nature of the process of socio-political transformation and crisis. It is demonstrated that the space of CCC is formed by intersection of the fields of monoconflicts of different types - political, economic. socio-cultural etc., by forming a pulsative and mobile structure of conflicting interaction. Conflicts of different types under highly dynamic transformation and crisis promote and mutually intensify one another.

AB The article deals with the "economic approach" in political science. Discussing the methodological and theoretical premises of applying methods of the economic science in political research, the author outlines the common axiomatic basis for the junction of the two branches of knowledge, i.e. of political and economic science. Corroborated by the analysis made, the conclusion is formulated, to the effect that it is quite possible to elaborate a complex approach based on economic methods of analysis and on the use of the abundant descriptive material of political science; in the long run, a paradigm of such complex approach is derived.

AB The article contains well structured material on the school of classical political realism and on directions that descend from it: theories of neorealism. varieties of geopolitics and of geoeconomics. The classical realists demonstrated in their time that divergence of interests, the leading powers' urge toward the expansion of their influence in the world endanger stability, cause conflicts, including armed conflicts, between subjects of the world politics. With its evolution, the realist school (in its structuralist variant) came to the comprehension of the significance of systemic mechanisms of securing order, to the understanding that states are not in a condition to defend their interests individually.

LA Russian
DT Article
AB It is the changes of Russia's political system at the new stage of its development, that are considered in the article. What is analyzed in detail, are, in particular, liberal-pluralistic innovations in the power party, aimed at increasing its influence in society and at acquiring qualities of the "dominant" party. Further, the thesis is argumented that notwithstanding the deep crisis of the opposition and its disruption, the issue of forming an opposition capable of functioning not only remains in the order of the day, but is becoming ever more topical. On the solution of this question, stresses the author, the vector of Russia's sociopolitical development in the nearest future will depend. To a perspective of authoritarian "party-state" he contraposes the alternative of "constructive convergence", e.g. of combining traditional Russian social-paternalistic with Western liberal-market elements.

AB The Arctic zone geopolitically is very important for all Arctic states. And it became such for Russia especially after breakdown of the USSR and reduction of its territory after separation of its southern and western regions because of spatial re-orientation of Russia development and acknowledgement of the role of Arctic in the long-term strategy of economic development. This area gives 95% of gas, 75% of oil, 90% of tin, the greater part of gold and diamond production. Arctic has enormous economic significance for Russia in view of the prospective development of hydrocarbons. Potential geological resources of oil and gas in Arctic and nearby regions are evaluated at over 200 billion tons and 400 trillion cubic meter, respectively. However, development of these resources occurring in extreme natural-climatic conditions will demand scale foreign investments. And we should not forget about the issues of their transportation, storage and processing. In the recent years the Arctic sea region turned into a source of international tension due to rivalry in getting access to its natural resources. This is caused, to some extent, by the fact that the legal regime of Arctic has not been determined in full so far. Installation in late 2007 of the Russian flag on the bottom of the Arctic Sea near the North Pole provoked the beginning of the "Great Northern Game" the stakes in which are extension of a continental shelf for development of natural resources. Already now it can be said with assurance that the 21st century will become the time of struggle for the Arctic expanses and will give rise to ambiguous response from the Arctic countries that is difficult to predict.

This strategy underlies the present interpretation of technologies of preventive management of crisis. Crisis management in a broad sense is a general management activity in a company on its conversion from unstable condition (stagnation, a collapse) to balanced reproduction. At all similarity, crisis-proof PR, understood as a complex of enabling technologies, oriented on preparation for crisis, including its forecasting, prevention and creation of crisis management plan, timely revealing and management of it, in order to form, preserve, or strengthen company's favorable reputation, as well as regulate its consequences, carried out continuously - is an independent sphere of activity which is different from crisis management.

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
AB The article observes some aspects of the world-outlook of the Russian cultural lite of the late XIX and the early XX centuries (the creators of the Silver Age). The analysis of its public views reveals that the cultural lite's revolutionary aim consisted not only in the economic and political reforms, but in the spiritual perfection of the society. The author arrives at a conclusion that these spiritual intentions were not able to solve effectively the crisis situation in Russian history of the early XX century.

DT Article
AB In the article the cognitive apparatus of the postnonclassical science is observed, its comparison with the interpretation of the cognition in evolutionary epistemology is made. It is shown that constructivism is an adequate epistemological scheme of explanation of existence, of evolutionary processes. The cognition thus acquires the character of sense-outcome. Herewith the sense does not belong to existence as at Heidegger or to the subject as at Kant, but it is formed in an interval, not in the emptiness, but in a merge, in an interaction of life and consciousness. If the process of the cognition is assimilated with the dialogue between Man and Nature, the sense is kept in the space of the active dialogue, it can not be entirely possessed by none of the "interlocutors".

TI Archive and Researcher: The Case of the RGIA
SO AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE
LA Russian
DT Article
AB The article treats the history of the Russian State Historical Archive in St. Petersburg as the major repository of documents pertaining to the political history of the Russian empire. A large-scale modern history of this archive has yet to be written, and the author expects such a history to deal with the information space of imperial power, with its political visions and its perceptions of the past. At the same time, the author does not argue for the Archive as a political institution and even less so as a locus of imperial power. Rather, he examines imperial Russia's patterns of document preservation as bureaucratically motivated, and therefore characteristic of all modern states - be they empires or nation states. The author also rejects the view that the RGIA as the first centralized all-Russian archive, established after the collapse of old Russia by the Bolshevik government, was aimed at producing an "usable past" for the political purposes of the new regime. The article stresses that the RGIA as an institution, as well as the RGIA's archival policies and principles of preservation, cataloging, and other aspects were results of complex negotiations between the Soviet power and the archivists and researches. The article treats as comparable the loses caused by ideological choices, by natural disasters, or by what the author defines as an archivists' technological thinking (e.g., to clean up space for new documents, to destroy redundant materials and focus on preservation and study of more valuable documents). In his view, the RGIA remains the major mandatory site for a better imperial history of Russia. The author believes that the major obstacle to the production of this better history is the RGIA's confused internal organization, including the absence of modern catalogues and electronic indexes that enable scholars to reach the ideal of a "comprehensive source base." The article concludes with the belief that 6.5 million RGIA documents - were they fully accessible - would give rise to a better history of Russia as an empire.

AB Last decades amaze with surprising changes in scientific and technical sphere. If you put beside a political card of the world of the beginning of the last century, and the card reflecting borders before the second world war, and then after it; and, at last, a modern card of frontiers can seem that is a question of the various worlds. The reasons constant a political card of the world are various. Liquidation of Soviet Union was welcomed and stimulated with the West to build on the postSoviet space new democratic communities. In it the proclaimed sense of present repartition of the world. But here there is a new ball of contradictions: how it is possible to spread democracy not democratic methods? New repartition of the world was transformed to deep political crisis of the world community.

AB Today the battle on the field of Kulikovo is a classic "memorial site" for Russian historiography and collective consciousness. However, its historical significance was not immediately felt, and a century elapsed before the Story of the massacre of Mamai appeared. This literary work, which answered the political priorities of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Russian rulers, abounds in inaccuracies and anachronisms resulting from the compiler's numerous borrowings. This mythical tale lent itself much better to rites, anniversaries and celebrations held in the memory of the great victory at Kulikovo than any prosaic factual report.

DT Article
AB "Financial industrial groups in Russian political process" states that big corporate capital is known to be an influential actor in social and political processes in Russia. Major factor for big business to influence political process is its impact on political and social associations, first of all, on the parties. The Russian State Duma is long known to be a field where corporate and financial capital is an active lobbyist. A new hierarchy of political actors with new linkages has emerged after B. Eltsyn. New quality of political system, so author, has emerged too. Previous conflict within power structures has become marginal, the public component of political process is waning, while the circle of decision-makers has widened to include political opposition. Under Putin, policy of equal remoteness for big businesses has been proclaimed. Nevertheless, recent events demonstrate a trend of joint bureaucratic and commercial structures to overcome their contradictions.

Solov'ev turned out to be the thinker who was able to do these things. An amateur in juridical questions, remote from the enlightenment rationalizations of political liberalism, Solov'ev set out to lay the basis for juridical freedom in way that was unexpected philosophically and culturally.

The paper in built on numerous sociological studies done by the author during last 10 to 12 years. Ethnoses inhabiting this region feature a set of properties needed in the first line to ensure their survival. Among the defensive qualities they display some traits that set them apart from Russians. They are less open and, respectively, not so hearty and sincere. Their actions are dominated not so much by emotional, as by rational motivations. They are not so gullible and naive. Certain shifts have been, however, found present in mass public opinion of original population regarding past, present, and future of their countries, as well as growth of positive attitudes towards locally residing Russian communities.

DT Article
AB The present article investigates the "Baltic question" as a problem pertaining to the government's domestic policy in the early twentieth century. Particular attention is paid to the relations between the central authorities and Imperial Russia's Baltic provinces. The question is considered from the perspective of the social and political context of Baltic society. The author studies the role of the Baltic German gentry in the life of the region and the juridical basis on which the particular status of the Baltic provinces in the composition of the state had been resting since the eighteenth century. The author draws upon a wide array of documentary sources from Russian and German archives to study the elaboration of reforms for the region. Great attention is devoted to the reform question which was put on the agenda in the early twentieth century, to the contents of these reforms and to how the government set about making them. There were two stages in their elaboration, the pre-war period (1907-1914) and from 1914 to 1917. The article shows that the First World War had an impact on the elaboration and realization of reforms. The February revolution put an end to them. In the conclusion, the author analyzes the government's policies in the region and the reasons for their failure.

TI "Russia" as a subject of sociology
SO SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Editorial Material
AB "Russia as sociology subject" discusses the issue of whether Russia might become a subject of its own for sociological study. There are at least two ways to do so, one being production of new judgements on "Russia", while the second consists in problematization of social, political, and ontological conditions for producing authentic sociological knowledge about Russia. Having discussed, i.a., some preconditions for an existence of "Russian sociologists", the author concludes that it is time to replace phenomenological thinking in sociology by a topologic one. Here, certain ideas of M. Heidegger (such as Heidegger's notion of the Gegnet) might be interpreted as a transition from horizontal transcendental structure of thinking to a topological one. This is a way to unite things seemingly remote and to differentiate things seemingly close, almost identical.

AB "Import of concepts, obsolete approaches or new original theories? contributes to a discussion about the state of and prospects for theoretical sociology in Russia. In particular, issues of borrowing outlandish theories and of the potentialities to produce own concepts of interest among Russian sociologists are discussed. The article pleads for a synthesis of imported concepts with developing previous approaches and producing new original theories emphasizing results of St.-Petersburg Russian sociological congress of 2000 and experiences of Novossibirsk School of economics and sociology. Recent decade is seen as a transition to new sociology mastering new approaches and building-up new concepts and paradigms. By combining three ways, prospects might open for social and political consent in the society, for economic growth, and an adequate ideological paradigm of social development.

Developing an independent corporate structure of their own, building-up and strengthening professional, social, and political associations of the scholarly communities are seen as a method to practically achieve the above goal. The author sees in corporate forms of social life in today's Russia a means for individuals of scholarly professions to realize themselves as an independent professional body of citizens with interests of its own ready to discuss and defend them in an organized way on the nationwide scale.

AB "Regional governments and reform of Russian federalism: scenarios for political future" looks into situation in Russia's regions and into issues of federalism against the background of recent V. Putin's moves. First, models practiced by the regions are analyzed. They demonstrate stronger regional elites enjoying greater trust by the people in them. Regional attitudes to V, Putin's nova are described against the background of changing federalism during the recent 10 years. In authors' opinion, Russia is drifting to a new model of federalism to combine centralist state with democratic grass-roots controls over the fate of the nation. Scenarios are suggested for a new constellation of social actors, who are involved into policy making by the center. Prospects for a mono-centrist power model are discussed as well.

AB "Info-consumption and political orientations" (by Vilen Ivanov and Mikhail Nazarov) sets fort results of a study aimed at measuring interrelation between mass information consumption and political orientations among Russia's population. The results permit to conclude that indices of political participation are positively linked to rates of media contacts, as are mass media consumption patterns to individuals' political preferences. Further, the authors suggest empirically grounded patterns linking TV-orientations to political preferences of the given audiences. The study is based on communicative behavior surveys in 1994 to 1996.

AB In the article the great numbers of political repressions, which were exaggerated by authors: R.A. Medvedev, A.I. Solzhenitsyn, O.G. Shatunovskoy, A.V. Antonov-Ovseenko in 80-90s are criticized. The author characterizes figures given in tens and even in hundreds of millions of victims as a statistical charlatanism.
   After checking up the KGB archives, and documents of division responsible for NKVD-MVD special settlements, the author spills the light on real numbers of political repressions in USSR. In his view, the total number of political victims does not exceed 2, 6 million people. This number implies over 800 thousand of death sentenced for political reasons, around 600 thousand political prisoners who died in labor camps, and about 1, 2 million people died in exile (including 'Kulak Exile') and during transportation (deported ethnic groups and others).

DE Epicurus; the pleasure in rest; the pleasure in movement; compromise
AB The paper considered the problem of the relationship of the sensual pleasures with the serenity of the soul in Epicurus. The author analyzes two interpretations of the teaching of Epicurus about pleasure. The first interpretation is based on the provision stating that Epicurus distinguishes two kinds of pleasure: the pleasure of rest and pleasure of movement. Consideration of the problem of the relationship of the sensual pleasures with the serenity of the soul has led us to the following results. It is shown that by sensual pleasures Epicurus understands any pleasure afforded by sensation. Speaking of sensual pleasures, Epicurus distinguishes simple sensual pleasure and luxury. The simple pleasures are those that lead to deliverance from suffering, that is, from hunger, thirst and cold. These pleasures do not contradict the serenity of the soul. To the luxury of sensual pleasures Epicurus relates the love of pleasure, delicious food and drink, nice music and entertainment. As to the pleasures of love, Epicurus calls to refrain from them as they are contrary to the serenity of the soul. Exquisite food and drink do not contradict the serenity of the soul, as Epicurus admits the possibility of its use only as a deliverance from hunger and thirst. The pleasure of entertainment and music are associated with joy and gladness, which relate to pleasures of the soul of Epicurus. It is established that Epicurus relates pleasure and fun not only to sensual pleasures, but also to the health of the body and serenity of the soul. We conclude that the only solution to this contradiction is a compromise between the pleasures of rest and pleasures of movement. Thus, the solution of the problem of correlation of sensory pleasures with the serenity of the soul in Epicurus is achieved a reasonable restriction of both kinds of pleasures.The second interpretation of the teachings of Epicurus about pleasure is built around the provision of a single pleasure, one aspect of which is the serenity of the soul. It is found that this interpretation is the solution of the problem of correlation of the sensual pleasures with the serenity of the soul. The author argues for the position that the basis of any pleasure is the pleasant motion of the senses. Consequently, it is concluded that pleasure can not be regarded as a completely neutral state, the opposite of sensual pleasures.

DE post-industrial society; the economy of knowledge; information
   technology; Knowledge-based Management; Knowledge Management
AB The article looks at the philosophical underpinnings of the latest organization management theory, which views knowledge as the most important strategic resource. The birth of this theory was triggered by the transition of developed nations to the innovation economy, which is a stage of economic development where the most significant role in the process of goods production and service accomplishment is played by intellectual resources. Increasing the effectiveness of the use of these resources is one of the most difficult challenges facing today's managers, which requires formation of specific approaches to organization management and encourages creation, dissemination and effective application of knowledge. The past twenty years have been marked by a fast transition from futuristic speculation to the clear need for adaptation to the realities of the society of knowledge. This transition has been much faster and more intensive than expected, which leads to considerable difficulties in understanding the changes that are taking place. The transition to the society of knowledge has required reconsideration of the existing organization management theories as well as organization management practice. There was a major shift in the organization management theory and practice in the 1990s. Before the 1990s knowledge was viewed just as information storage. Today knowledge is thought of as allow. In other words, today the emphasis is placed on the life of knowledge within an organization. The shift to the new idea of knowledge in the 1990s in the West lead to the birth of a new management theory called Knowledge Management (KM). Today the Knowledge Management theory is only becoming popular in Russia. The unusual combination of words in the name of the theory causes common misunderstanding of the meaning of the term. Some researchers prefer to use the English term rather than translate it into Russian, as the term Knowledge Management can be translated into Russian in different ways with a difference in meaning. Understanding of the new term is also hampered by the confusion in the way western researchers understand and use the term. While some researchers view Knowledge Management as serving a particular functional objective, to others Knowledge Management is a new paradigm of organization management. It would be wrong to say that the different ways in which the term is employed conflict with one another but there is an obvious need for a logically structured system of the theory. Knowledge Management finds itself at the crossing of 3 three fields: Business Administration, Information science, Humanities. These three sides allow viewing Knowledge Management from different angles as well formulating different objectives depending on the object in question.Many Russian companies make a common mistake of applying a technocraticc approach with an emphasis on using information and communication technology which is ineffective in itself and reminds an empty water pipe network. Misunderstanding of the theory of Knowledge Management leads to its low efficiency. The author believes that there is a need for different terms for management of knowledge and organization management based on the primary role of knowledge and suggests the term Knowledge-based Management that would integrate all the different approaches and emphasize the importance of paying attention to all the aspects of Knowledge Management being the core of Knowledge-based Management.

DE epistemological relativism; simulacrum concept; language reality;
   discourse; presupposition
AB The present article is devoted to the phenomenon of knowledge consistency in terms of cultural and historical discourse applicability; the nature of "objectivity" of constitutive principles (knowledge) is confirmed by epistemological relativism. The way of reality comprehension is provided by a certain method of the reality's pattern formation. Irresistibility of the discourse limits is conditioned not by an object of perception, as it is, but by our probable perception of this object. Presupposition is assumed to be an integral part and an indispensable condition of the discourse. Discredit to the relativistic view of the world was conditioned by affirmation of impossibility of the real state of affairs'assertion. According to Feyrabend, the nature of epistemologic relativism can be explained by the fact that "Opinions not associated with traditions are beyond human existence, they are not even opinions in fact, if their content is not associated with constitutive principles of the tradition they belong to. The opinions can be objective to the extent that they do not contain any references to these principles...they appear as if they originate from the very essence of the world, though in fact they only express peculiarities of a certain approach". In this respect, objectivization of a subject or objectivity of a scientific approach are actually determined by the process of conveyance of the world's essence by means of individuated human existence which makes the experience reframe process permanent. The "objective" laws discovered and established by a knower are identified with the reality of these objective laws without any grounds. This state of affairs has become possible owing to historical priority of the subject-object principle of cognition. The principles of new explication of the notion condition the constitution of a new discourse. Different kinds of knowledge as models of a certain typeare different ways of the reality's structuring with a relevant criterion constituting grounds for them.

AB This article analyzes the theoretical aspects of the functioning of public political communication. N. Luman's ideas of system theory are presented as the foundation to support the hypothesis that modern mass media of Russia form "crisis communication". It manifests itself in the system violation of interaction between actors in the communicative process. Dialectical relation between the media field and political field, determination of the media goals are proposed to consider according to Pierre Bourdieu's distinguishing of features of the personifying accentuation. The transformation of political communication appears in changing of the nature of the relation between government and society. Traditional media and forms of political control over them are losing their meaning.Media have to change: to change the format, principles and mechanisms of public policy. Under the influence of social economic reforms the market relationship between media and government forms and enhances. As a result, the media become dependent from social institutions and social groups that have financial and administrative resources with certain political interests, and thereby obtain the opportunity to use the information policy for their own goals.Crisis behavior is manifested in the systematic violation of interaction: the message does not reach the addressee or it does but produce very different or unexpected and unpredictable effect. The crisis is developing in terms of lack of information and lack of trust from the recipient. The consequence of the communication crisis is the destruction of the system of common democratic values and norms, intolerance of political parties and conformity of the masses. The absence of bilateral political communicational relations, namely lack of the reverse response of the society on the government, leads to social stress, development of social conflicts, a decline in the legitimacy of political institutions, the emergence of crisis situations. The transformation of political communication appears in change of the nature of the relations between the government and society and is due to mismatch of priorities, ideology and interests of different groups of influence on crucial social and political issues. Opacity of the system in the action of the national media, maneuvering between the interests of information consumers, state agencies and interest groups, helps to change the nature of the interaction of the main actors in the communicative process, of the sources of influence on the political aspect of broadcasting, and therefore on the principles of formation and functioning of public political communication. Functional pragmatics of the media today is not conducive to the development of tolerance in the formation of civil society in Russia. All mentioned above is a measure of destructive dysfunctionality of dependent media, the loss of tolerance in the formation of the civil society. The essence of the crisis of the political field can be defined as the growing imbalance in the public space, which is reflected in the loss of their equilibrium between the government and civil society.

   ENVIRONMENT IN ALTAI REPUBLIC).
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE radical Islamic organizations; political Islam; Arab spring
AB Today more researchers understand the necessity of the use and working out of a complex approach to study religion. In a number of cases such phenomena as feelings, belief, mystical experience, emotions, and religion itself fall out of the main target of research. This leads to an adequate ques-tion about translation and introduction of scientific terms in the sphere of description and study of religion and vice versa. The problem of typology of religious traditions cannot be sufficiently explained, because it involves the necessity to find both the appropriate scientific notions and the introduction of scientific terms into the science and the consent to this of the scientific society. The necessity of conceptualization (fixation in notions) simultaneously leads to reduction of live religion to almost lifeless theories in religion studies. Polymethodic study of religion is especially important in the light of the introduction of an educational course of Basics of Religious and Secular Ethics (BRSE) in the polyethnic and polyreligious region (the Altai Republic), and of the introduction of topics and discussions about new religious movements (NRM). It is also important to know and study minorities in the religious sense and regional specific features. In the Altai Republic, for example, a specific ethnocultural religious environment should be a separate field for the research. Most of the local Altai beliefs are represented by the activity of social organizations (''Tengry'', ''Ene til'', ''The Altai Spiritual Centre'', etc.), although it is now that the processes of their reforming into religious organizations have begun. An example of this work is the activity of organizations that popularize the ideas of ''White Belief'', burkhanizm and tengrianism. The question about understanding and giving explanation of NRMs is still a critical issue. Important features of NRMs are the following characteristics: takeover of the confessional space and its distortion, specific properties of novations, appearance of new indicators, cultural pluralism, etc. Apart from the traditional religions, such as the Russian Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the Islamic organizations and different Protestant religious organizations, the local pagan, shaman, burkhanism, tengrianism and White Belief (Ak Dian) organizations work. Part of them are registered in the status of a social organization, for example, ''Tengri'' and ''The Altai Spiritual Centre''. White Belief, burkhanism and some other directions still do not refer to any religious class. It is suffice to mention the problem of extremism. In the Altai Republic this problem exists in the form of Islamic religious extremism and nationalism on the part of some Altai religious leaders. The religion, in its true sense, is a very strong mechanism that resists extremism. It is the religious consciousness that is capable of solving and mitigating the problem of growth of extremism actions in the 21st century. Still, we see sometimes that fake fanatic speculations, composed of chaotic bits from different religious beliefs, are confused with true ideas of religion.

DE madness; mysticism; christianity; the belief and knowledge; sacral
   experience
AB The author considers idea of madness as one of ways of expression of sacral experience of the person. For the first time in the European culture it has been formulated by apostle Paul as idea of "super-understanding" before reason of the world; thus, this idea becomes way of an embodiment, first of all, paroxysm Christian experience of belief. Having received antinomical the specification, the idea of madness, on the one hand, contacts idea absolute unknowability and inaccessibility of the God, on the other hand - with an opportunity of the inaccessible God to communicate with the real person, to enter into its nature. In the theoretical plan the idea of madness receives the development in history of becoming dogmatic persons, especially, in the field of mystical divinity. Efforts of apologists, "grand Cappadocians", and also Dionysius Areopagit, down to theological disputes on nature Favor's light in the middle of XIV century, develop tradition apophaticism as a way of preservation and transfer numinous Christian experience in the European culture, as attempt to save this experience from all kinds rational emasculationtIn the practical attitude as a feat of belief and vital practice, the idea of madness was realized, for example, in such paradoxical - from the point of view of "natural" moral and social "nature" of the person - a phenomenon, as craziness, becoming one of the brightest features of Russian attitude. The further development connected with the general course of the European culture, idea of madness gets in the West in various forms of mystical individualism, mainly in XV century In particular, has been paid special attention for a visual image of madness, and also on a theme macabre in painting the late Middle Ages in which the general has found expression intention, defining madness as a symbol of a temptation Godforsakenness. Madness began to express itself the human desires connected with somatic, sensuality and erotic. The conclusion: in a basis of historical transition from initial understanding of madness as lifes-presence of the God to tragical experience of madness as lifes-absence of the God the structure of the most Christian sacralis, constructed on an antithesis and collision of two worlds, two reasons, two moral lays. In this process it was displayed not only destiny of the European consciousness; experience of madness became way of resistance to classical installations of thinking and the is rational emasculated forms of a life.

DE deflationism; truth; semantic paradoxes; epistemicism; pragmatism
AB Semantic epistemicism is a way of resolving of semantic paradoxes, in particular the paradox of liar and the paradoxes associated with semantically indeterminate terms (paradoxes of vagueness). Deflationism about truth can be defined as a theory of truth according to which the notion of truth is understood as a metaphysically empty notion, performing a specific logical-linguistic functions in a language, and such a notion that can be fully explained by the equivalence scheme. As part of the approach of semantic epistemicism, what is traditionally considered as the semantic paradoxes is given a new interpretation as epistemic paradoxes. In this connection, it can be argued that the resolving of these paradoxes is epistemological rather than a semantic problem. As part of the semantic epistemicism argues that the border (the sharp cut-off points of the use of "indeterminate" terms) exists, but it is not knowable to ordinary speakers. In the application of semantic epistemicism to resolve semantic paradoxes in the deflationary approach it is necessary to limit the intersubstitution of sides of deflationary equivalence scheme. To resolve problems with interchangeability of left and right sides of the equivalence scheme the concept of contextuality can be used to limit the scheme, the additional requirement of dispositional nature of the readiness of a particular speaker to interchange left and right sides of the equivalence scheme. Introducing such a pragmatic principle, we are able to approach the epistemic definition of semantic concepts. This approach can be developed as a pragmatic interpretation of deflationism.

The author submits a precise tabular definition of alethic modalities as moral-legal evaluation-functions determined by two evaluation-variables in two-valued algebra of metaphysics. In the algebraic system under investigation, an equivalence relation is strictly defined and a list of equations is generated. The alethic necessity is studied especially. For the first time a formal-axiological law of contraposition of binary operation "necessity" is formulated precisely and demonstrated convincingly by computing corresponding evaluation-tables in two-valued algebra of metaphysics.

DE overcoming of metaphysics; Nietzsche; postmetaphysical thinking;
   strategies of philosophy; style of philosophy
AB Nietzsche's project of reform in philosophy intended not so much new revision of traditional content of metaphysics, as transformation the philosophy as the very genre. In case of research into post-metaphysical ideas of Nietzsche's philosophy we have to consider him as the prophet of the new philosophy, ignoring his critics of the philosophy's claims on priest's know-all. The author advances the idea, that Nietzsche's style of philosophical writing has features of post-metaphysics, rather than philosophical content.Nietzsche's aphoristic writing has features of plurality, withstood dogmatism, not avoided contradictions and divided sight in interpretative perspectives. Nietzsche's text is heterogeneous in principal, conflicting and mixing not only different senses, but also different styles, irredundant to integrated synthesis. Just in such writing the deconstruction of basic notions of metaphysics (such as ego, substance, cause and effect and so on) takes place. In consideration of difficulty of intention and style of Nietzsche's text, it is necessarily to produce strategies of special reading in the gap between senses and styles of thinking. From P. de Mann's point of view, a systematical critic of main metaphysical notions has necessarily to correlate with his rhetoric. Nietzsche treats tropes not as ornament or figural meaning; tropes are not "supplement" to the literal meaning, but necessary and unavoidable mean of thought expression. We can say that Nietzsche treats a language as a place of truth, not as unconcealing, but as illusion-veils. A style is acceptance of conditionality and illusoriness of the language, using it for creating one's own mirages. Believe in the existence of literal sense, free of rhetorical ambiguity is illusion. Thus philosophy becomes metaphysics not when it uses metaphors, but when it forgives its metaphorical base. Nietzsche's discourse uses itself criticized "metaphors" of metaphysics. If we apply Nietzsche's logic of critics of metaphysics to his own discourse, we have to treat his very text as determined rhetorically. Dissonance of thematic and rhetoric reading prevents the reader from the complacency of metaphysical reading of the irredundant to a set of theses text. Thus we can conclude that post-metaphysical thinking is not extermination of metaphysics in all its forms (such negativism is one more manifestation of metaphysical dogmatism). Post-metaphysical nature of Nietzsche's thinking declares itself not only in the sense of statements, but in dis-tanz between the sense and rhetoric, in mixing of styles, perspectives, voices and interpretations.

DE rule following problem; skeptic argument
AB The paper is devoted to the rule-following problem and skeptic argument, which were stated by S. A. Kripke. The discussion of rule-following, concentrated in Philosophical Investigations & sect;& sect;185-242 and in part VI of the Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics, is absolutely central to Wittgenstein's "later" philosophies of language, mathematics and mind. So, rule-following problem and skeptic argument are considering in context of "later" Wittgenstein. According to Kripke, the paradox is how can one follow in accord with a rule - the applications of which are potentially infinite - when the instances from which one learns the rule and the instances in which one displays that one has learned the rule are only finite? How can one be certain of rule-following at all? Crucial point against Kripke's reading is that an initial material for the discussion of rule-following, concentrated in Philosophical Investigations & sect;& sect;185-242 does not links with the distinction between finite instances and potentially infinite rule, but - a distinction between rule and rule-following. Rule-following does not need any ground of formalized or generally formulated rule, it take place of itself. Rule-following problem is a pseudo-problem. According to this straight attempt to solve the problem was critically revised.

Generalizations have been made from the point of view of model of "research programmes" of I.Lakatos. This approach allows revealing an axiomatic part of a paradigm, and its auxiliary concepts and hypotheses. In structure of a "hard core" of the world-systems analysis contains a principle of the external bases of social dynamics, a principle of econom-sentrisme, a principle of " necessary backwardness", and a principle of "pyramid". In structure of "a protective belt" of the world-systems analysis contains: the concept considering kinds of world systems, the concept of non-uniform dynamics of accumulation of the capital, the concept of noncapitalistic ways inside of capitalism, and also cyclic models of accumulation of the capital. The principle of "pyramid" designate, that the logic of accumulation of the capital is those, that the hierarchy inside of the World-Economy is always kept. Inside of each of steps of a pyramid "the pyramidal proportion" repeats: the more close to a Core of the World-Economy, the more commercial monopolism, and less a market competition, a Redistribution, and a Reciprocity. In this article is formulated the concept of ways-equalisers which "will amortize" process of accumulation of the capital and provoke effect of "structural backwardness". Models of cycles of accumulation of the capital can be used as a way of an explanation of regional and world social dynamics.

DE crisis; culture; values
AB The article examines problem of crisis of value foundations of culture. One of the contexts of use buzzword "crisis" with respect to the culture in which the crisis is investigated through an understanding of culture as a system of value interconnection is considered. It is revealed that the crisis of culture is understood as a necessary or random change values. In the classical literature there are two points of view on the crisis in the meaning of the need to change (follows from the very development of culture) the values: a transition from one form of culture to another or a transition from one culture to another, respectively. In research based on the acceptance of random (sporadic) change of values, positions that the main causes of the crisis of culture assume the society or person are distinguished.It is drawn a conclusion, that the understanding of cultural crisis as a necessary to change values crisis is considered as a neutral process that can lead to positive or negative consequences. In the investigation of cultural crisis as a random change of values (sporadic, depending on the reasons for non-binding: on the state of society or on the consciousness of individuals) crisis, is generally credited with negative property. But the etymology of the word "crisis" suggests that it is a phenomenon, which is deprived of established values interconnections, while in the process of which it is impossible to make an unambiguous decision. The situation, when things are bad or good - it's position before or after the crisis.A definition of the of crisis of value foundations of culture as a process of rethinking the connections between the spheres of society in which it is impossible to give a clear answer to the question of what connections exist between the spheres of society is provided. If the answer can be unequivocal, there is no crisis. If the situation is incomprehensible, the values are changing.

DE Aristotle; inquiry; method Meno's paradox; episleme; epistemic inquiry
AB The article raises the question of inquiry methods in Aristotle. It examines different types of inquiry: empirical, endoxical, practical, theoretical, poetical, dialectical, epistemic, ethical, philosophical. Attempt to unify the Aristotle's inquiry account leads us to formulate two problems: the problem of correlation and the problem of coordination. The first problem describes the coordination of practical and theoretical reason with the practical and the theoretical inquiry, as well as the sphere of application of practical and theoretical inquiry. The second problem sets one to one correspondence of endoxical, dialectic, ethical, philosophical inquiries both among themselves and correspondence of each of these types of inquiry to the theoretical or practical inquiry. Further, the paper analyzes the idea of inquiry in Aristotle within the context of the inquiry in the former philosophy's doctrines, namely in the context of the Meno's paradox: whether to seek what is already known (Z1) or seek that can't be known at all (Z2). It is shown that the Aristotelian "solution of the paradox" is not strict logical solution, it is similar to the way Plato avoid the problem of this paradox. There is a point of view that Aristotle solved this paradox having used preunderstanding, but this approach gives little as far as preunderstanding raises from phainomena it is necessary anyway to prove truth of this preunderstanding. In general, in his response to the paradox Aristotle admitted the principle of inquiry the whole by its parts despite that difficulties which that principle implies. In Aristotle's doctrine there is an important clarification to the understanding of the inquiry: any inquiry is possible only where there is no episteme, and the episteme is the final result of all inquiries. In the relation to the episteme Aristotle actually rethought Meno's paradox: as a necessary move from Z2 to Z1 - from lack of knowledge to the absolute one. And if the first premise of the paradox - the unknown cannot be found - is discarded completely and it is postulated the need for such an inquiry, the second premise in Aristotle fundamentally reviewed in comparison with the previous tradition, and it is used in the following way - absolute knowledge is obtainable and if we have achieved absolute knowledge, the inquiry stops,. As a result, we admitted that the highest status in the Aristotle's doctrine had the epistemic inquiry as the inquiry for absolute knowledge.

DT Review
AB The current state of the theory of historical science is usually defined as critical, characterized by departure from the search for common schemes in the study of "microhistory." However, the presence of certain economic and demographic regularities is recognized not only by historians but also by economists and politicians. The article published below considers such regularities and the theory that describes them, the topicality of which is determined by the fact that the Malthusian regularities under consideration not only manifested themselves clearly in the epoch of preindustrial society but also play a significant role in the economic life of developing countries.

TI INTERDISCIPLINARY ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS IN LABOUR MARKET RESEARCH
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE economic behaviour; labour; labour market; interdisciplinary studies;
   economic theory; economic sociology
AB Work, professional work are the most important components of life that reveal to the person the enormous revenue opportunities and realize their potential. Work is also one of the fundamental values of economic culture, which is manifested through the relationship of person and society to work. The labour market, in particular, acts as the original criterion of social change in society. Massive changes in the labour market indicate social changes, their positive or negative direction. The labour market is a category of not only economic, but also social order. Labour market research in this regard is carried out by a number of sciences (Economics, Labour Economy, Sociology, Sociology of Work, Sociology of Labour Market). However, the basis of theoretical research in the science of work and labour market is laid by Economics. To analyze the economic behaviour of actors in the labour market there are four basic principles: 1) the principle of self-interest; 2) the principle of utility; 3) the principle of cost minimization; 4) the principle of maximizing profits. Recognition of ''the principle of economic individualism'' as obsolete, excluding individual characteristics of the person, group and society from the economic analysis, results in the appeal to the social sciences, in particular to the methodology of economic sociology in the study of economic behaviour of actors in the labour market. Economic sociology presents a socialized person, able to develop and implement new social roles; economic relations between people and organizations do not exist in the abstract model of an idealized market, but work through the social network, the social structure. Interdisciplinary analysis and synthesis allows to identify and summarize the specific features of the functioning of the Russian labour market and its segments; to produce adequate directions of state regulation of the labour market and the social and labour relations, including policies on income, employment, job creation, creating a safe labour environment; to predict the trends of the labour market, its potential problems, and develop preventive measures. It should be noted that the irrational behaviour of the Russians, the importance of social relations and links, cultural diversity, multi-ethnicity in our country, authority based on the social relations make the interdisciplinary studies in the economy, employment in particular, topical. Economics must also undergo changes and be adequate to new economic, social and political circumstances, and investigate the formation of the person (human behaviour) in life and work in the new global environment.

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

DT Article
DE innovation development; entrepreneurship; authorities; North Carolina
AB The North Carolina innovation business development policy is a great example of successful governance, ''an American dream''. The state without sufficient advantages in the spheres of higher education and industry transferred its economy on innovation basis. But the greatest work was done by the government of the region and it is connected with the predominance of the Democratic Party members in the North Carolina political establishment. Almost all governors of the state who took their seats after the Second World War were Democrats. One of the components of their ideology is greater state regulation of economy and the North Carolina authorities acted as true Democrats, creating institutions of innovation business development. The creation of institutions, contributing to innovation policy of North Carolina began in 1950s. In 1956 the Research Triangle Park was created. Luther Hodges the Governor of North Carolina agreed with recommendations of business leaders and industrialists and signed the executive order, initiating the Research Triangle Project, an industrial park which transformed the state from the agrarian into the industrial one. There are three main channels of incentives for high-tech businesses: the structures created by the authorities, universities and business associations. But such system did not appear at once. At the beginning of innovation way to success the authorities determined the directions of state development in the sphere of science. To fulfill the task the North Carolina Board of Science and Technology was created in 1963. In the state there were three main types of technology: biotechnology, green energy and defence technologies. The position of high-tech business is represented by the NC Technology Association. It is an organization with established membership: representatives of big corporations take part in the work of the association and are simultaneously the sponsors. Politicians are invited to different events to discuss certain projects and legislations. In 1984 the North Carolina State Universities established Small Business and Technology Development Center. The unique structure of the university allows it to provide mentorship for high-tech businesses. North Carolina determined the priorities of innovation development, built the structure responsible for attracting investment to the emerging start-ups. The key of the state's success is the combination of the public-private approach in creation and functioning of this structure.

DE multilingualism; website
AB A research of multilingualism was carried out within the framework of researching the university town official websites. The purpose of this work was the analysis of experiences of creating and functioning that sites to develop Tomsk official website subsequently, which would position the town as a university town (however, not only). The multilingualism function provides the possibility of perception and interpretation of information on a website by foreign-language-speaking users, who could consist of not only students (university entrants) and an academic staff of higher education institutions, but also tourists, potential partners in business, investors, etc. In turn, the work with these groups of people influence on competitiveness and prestige level of both the high schools and the town. Seventy-one university towns (and their websites) all over the world were selected for this research. Different ways to organize a translation were considered. As a result, all websites were divided into four large categories: monolingual (where the multilingualism function wasn't provided), with a built-in automatic translator (provided by special programs such as Google Translate, online), websites where a professional translation of web pages were provided, and ones which combined two last ways. Pros and cons of each method were identified, and in a case of professional translation - probable modifications (a partial translation). The result of the work is a conclusion about what way of multilingualism function implementation is the most rational and acceptable. It is a combination of professional translation and built-in automatic translator. This is the only way that allows combining a translation quality and a wide choice of available languages. Herewith, the costs are only a little bit higher than when the professional translation of web pages is carried out only. Thus, this article could be used as a practical recommendation at a process of the Tomsk official website development.

DE political discourse analysis; future concept; program of a political
   party
AB In the article it says about the representation of the future concept in the programs of Russian parliamentary parties. The future concept treated in this article is basic not for the political discourse but for the person and the society in general. The very structure of the political parties programs contribute to the bright reflection of the future concept. Thereby, the entire party program can be viewed as a linguistic expression of the future concept. The article deals with the expression of the future concept in the programs of major Russian political parties that form the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation according to the results of the parliamentary elections in December 2011: "United Russia", the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Liberal Democratic Party of the Russian Federation" and "A Just Russia".
   The analysis of party programs texts allows to present the future concept structure in the party program documents treated. This analysis shows that through its programs, parties declare their sociopolitical priorities, they express their view of how to resolve urgent problems of the society and the state, of the economic, political and social reforms. The analysis of the obligations and objectives of parties allows speaking that these measures are mostly of idea restoration character towards the Soviet period. The idea of a strong state of the Soviet model is attractive to the Russian electorate. However, in modern Russia the political parties nevertheless have to decline their claim to the total control of the future, the citizens want to choose the optimal future concept themselves.

AB Party systems in subnational regions may to be research by some comparative politics methods. One of them is quantitative typologies of party systems, proposed by M. Duverger, J.Blondel and G. Sartory. But these methods become effective only with use of some indexes, which urged to estimate scales and intensity of an interparty competition. The wide circulation was received by an index of effective number of parties (ENP), the offered M. Laakso and R. Taagepera (1979). The analysis of merits and demerits of this index leads scientists from the different countries to necessity of development of alternative and correcting quantity indicators. Interesting example of this work is formula ENP of G.V. Golosov (2010). In this article the comparative analysis of indexes of Laakso-Taagepera and Golosov on the basis of materials of elections in Legislative Assemblies of regions of Western Siberia which have taken place in 2000th years is carried out. As basis for calculations the data placed in a database of the Center of assistance of democracy and human rights "GELIKS" and on official sites of election committees of Omsk and Tomsk areas has served. The obtained data testifies that the index of Golosov shows lower values for all studied cases and it allows avoiding revaluation of a share of the largest party in system. Therefore with its help it is possible to estimate more precisely scales of an interparty competition in each region. However this index poorly reacts to degree of coverage by parties of the deputy case. Calculation of indexes of Laakso-Taagepera and Golosov for the legislatures of Western Siberia allows describing dynamics of regional party systems in a new fashion. The defragmentation of party systems was accompanied in first half 2000th by strengthening of positions of parties in regions and competition growth between them. But subsequently this competition is curtailed that everywhere leads to one-party domination. Thus, unification of party systems becomes one more tendency of development of a regional policy in second half 2000th.

AB The article specifies that multiple aspects of the ideological heritage of Siberian regionalists can raise the question of allocation of the dominant ideas in it genome. Determination of regionalism as a social phenomenon, organically synthesized complexes views uplift and political persuasion, it is important for the reconstruction of the system-core oblastnicheskoy ideas. It is shown that regionalism and even for themselves the ideologues of the Siberian patriotism is, first and foremost, a social movement kulturtregerskogo order. However, to address the unique "cultural problems" regionalists developed programs of political development in the region. With this purpose, self-worth and underscored the universal relevance of popular sovereignty as the basis for future economic prosperity and social and cultural development of society "under the banner of freedom and independence". It is established that the very state of humanistic thought of Siberian intelligentsia regarded as allied set of regions, each with its own local interests, which are closely connected with the interests of nation-wide. Therefore, the most fruitful political form of "people's lives," they recognized only the Federation, as in a federal democratic state organization of the country's population and it is possible an adequate, full-bodied and full cultural development themselves "the people's provincial started." In general, the article shows that the idea of immanent oblastnicheskoy emphasis on the cultural component, as its developers are not having legal opportunities for full development of their union-federalist project changes, in adverse political conditions, just had to choose the most optimal in terms of the direction of activity. That the only possible area of practical application of their creative powers is their only kulturtregerstvo and enlightenment in the widest sense of those terms. Therefore, it is kulturnichestvo regionalists was actually the main driver for them momentum. Accordingly, it should be considered and a key component oblastnicheskogo attitude. However, it is clear that the political program of the leaders of the movement was oblastnicheskogo synthetic part of their ideological work.

AB Territorial image researches are a key mean of selecting the best strategy for implementing political goals of regional development. So at the present time the issue of territorial image has become the subject matter for many political scientists.

TI CULTURAL APPROACH IN STUDIES OF GLOBALIZATION: URGENCY OF COMMUNICATIVE

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE globalization; local culture; cultural identity; intercultural dialogue;
   communicative potential of culture
AB In this article problems of communicative potential of local cultures studying in the globalized world are considered. The urgency of the reasons analysis and possible ways of this problem solutions search is connected with the absence of the intercultural dialogue conception and effective mechanisms of peoples' and local cultures' intercommunication. First of all, the authors accent disagreements in understanding the globalization connected with the variety of research approaches to this phenomenon. It is marked that in studying globalization the political-economic aspect dominates, thus not allowing to estimate objectively its consequence in the area of culture. The authors state the necessity of the humanitarian approach that reveals the specific character of the processes of globalization in culture, distinct from their economic and political topology. The value of a new humanitarian paradigm that integrates knowledge and experience of various sciences in interpreting of the global world realities is proved. This paradigm is not only to explain variations taking place in the world system, but also to shape the outlook of ''the person of the third millennium''. Thus, ideology of the cultural approach is confidence in the multilevel character of globalization. The key feature is that globalization in culture does not reduce to tendencies of unification and loss of national originality of cultures, to mandatory leveling of literary, art and world outlook processes. On the contrary, problems of a specific character of national cultures and national identity become most aggravated, which, in turn, generates difficulties of intercultural dialogue. Cultural studies allow to reveal tendencies of local cultures number growth and make problems of intercultural communication topical. At the same time, the humanitarian approach reveals a specific character of counteracting processes of the globalized world. The authors of article prove the necessity of the relevant analysis and an assessment of the dual character of globalization. The urgency is marked of the variety of local cultures support from universal communities. An ideological basis of such support should be the recognition of value of cultural identities. In turn, viability and stability of local cultures that adapt to modern conditions is defined by the level of their communicative potential. It is supposed to use the results of the analysis for further development of effective ways of intercultural communications.

AB In offered article the phenomenon of political image in a context of a virtual political reality is considered. This theme is relevant because till now there is a set of different interpretations in the definition of political image essence in the sphere of a political reality. The political reality has constructivist character since it is generated by the creative certificate of consciousness. In this process the political culture which bears itself the certain codes responsible for perception of events and the phenomena has enormous value. It is actually possible to speak about existence of the special world - the world of political images. Its reality possesses the doubtless reliability in the people opinion and directly influences on their perception of carriers of various typified roles - images. The image thus can be defined as an artificially created con, a simulacrum operating in the sphere of a virtual political reality. Getting into consciousness of the audience, it influences on people perception of events and phenomena. Considering the plurality of a reality, it is possible to speak about the plurality of political images which represent in aggregate the special world which is, in turn, a specific political reality which is formed in minds of people by means of modern mass media and communications.

TI HOUSING CODE OF RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS NOT NECESSARY
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE right to dwelling; Housing Code
AB Life has shown the real importance of valid housing laws, instead of simply declared guarantees of its realization. Destruction of socialist system of economy and legislation occurred in a historically short time. Housing law decayed from 1990 (the Law on property in the USSR) till 1994 when the project of a new Housing Code was published, and Part I of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation was introduced. Art. 212-213 of the Civil Code stated, '' The Russian Federation recognises private, state, municipal and other forms of property. The amount and cost of property owned by citizens and legal bodies is not limited.''. Introduction of the new Housing Code since March 1, 2005 has caused mass protest actions under slogans '' Down with the Antisocial code'', Anti-housing, Anti-national, etc. Such a reaction should have been anticipated, during the Code concept discussion, but it did not happen and, as a result, the new Housing Code was a strong social irritant. The wording of the Code was very careful (Article 1), still it became obvious that the state shifted off the control over the most essential right of citizens. Real guarantees of a constitutional right to dwelling, listed in Article 1 of the Housing Code of the RSFSR disappeared, too. Some of the guarantees, as a matter of fact, contrasted into obstacles and restrictions. At present, there are no high rates of development of state and public housing fund based on State Planning, no fair distribution of dwelling under public control. The former guarantee of the low rent and utilities payment seems a mockery. Experts criticise the structure and content of the current Housing Code. Claims to the authors of the project are caused by two circumstances: first, ignoring certain important conclusions of the Soviet science on housing law, and, second, aspiration to react to the problematic issues of practice with a substantially political character. The quality of regulatory material in the current Housing Code of the Russian Federation is not efficient, as it is abundant in norms of different branches of law, duplicating them. There is an impression that the authors of the project included the positions about payment for premises and utilities (Articles 153-160), about powers, state control, and others in the Code, on purpose, somehow to neutralize the negative effect of the basic thesis: the state will not grant dwelling.

AB The subject of analysis are some specific features of D. Davidson's theories of meaning and interpretation which underlie his optimistic epistemological position in regard both to knowledge about the world and understanding others. It is demonstrated that, according to basic theses of David-sonian theory of meaning, the interpretation has a unifying character. This, on one hand, makes the epistemological optimism possible but, on the other hand, confines the applicability of such a notion of interpretation to propositional languages.

AB All history of humanism is a process of persons active knowledge at first the beginning, then - society and his place in it, up to the idea of the world reorganization for the benefit of the person. Humanistic tendencies are observed in all world religions, in the history of all previous and existing social formations. It is thought that numerous humanistic paradigms can be refered either to contemplate type of humanism, or to active type. The humanism can be either contemplate, close to east perception of the surrounding validity, or creative, that on the one hand is closer both to mentality of the western person and to a creative paradigm modern "person technical". Naturally, both tendencies are inherent in a number humanistic paradigms and only relative overweight of the contemplate or active beginning allows to carry a certain humanistic paradigm to corresponding type.Within the limits of contemplate humanism east humanism accented on a theme of nonresistance, humility, causings no harm to alive has been considered. We have alsorefered ecological humanism for which line of person and nature merge for the sake of harmony achievement. Silo humanism and Vernadsky humanism, having immanent to east humanism are characteristic to a contemplate paradigm.Within the limits of active humanism we have considered antique humanistic tradition, which has developed the idea of anthropocentrism. Humanistic idea is immanently inherent to Christianity. The Christian humanism can not be refered simply to contemplate or active type. But in Christianity the idea of the person as similarity of God has been arisen, that isn't characteristic for contemplate east tradition. The christianity in historical process has become the basis for development in itself a powerful improving current - humanism of Renaissance, which in its turn has been an incitement for development of an active current - secular and neohumanistic paradigm of new time epoch.Humanistic tendencies have got new coloring during an epoch of industrial production and society liberalization development. From liberal humanism of an epoch of Enlightenment, proclaiming freedom and equality, to communistic (socialist, proletarian) Soviet humanism of an epoch of the XX-th century restless beginning.At the present stage of the world community development the ideas of civil, global humanism, transhumanism have got a big sounding. All of them bear in themselves features of active humanism, focused on the formation of universal hostel on a planet, settlements of conflicts peacefully.

The purpose is to reveal a problematics, ways of the decision, fundamental propositions and the methodology offered by the said researchers. The conclusion is drawn that the social studies of science which are carried out by B. Latur and S. Woolgar offer a new vision of science as a practice - observable ways of action in which certain rules are not simply realized or individual improvisation is carried out but they are realized as something common. A real scientific practice appears as possessing the unity and the integrity, falling outside the limits of the developed disciplinary borders. Thus the attention of the researchers is turned not only to the analysis of separately taken scientific practices but accompanied by studying on the one hand their history, on the other, - by statement of a question of their prospectives.

DE Russian emigre philosophy of 20-30 years
AB We study its progress and theoretical positions of the participants. Its main members are S. Bulgakov, G. Florovsky and Vl. Lossky. Bulgakov's supporters were a circle of Berdyaev and almost all teaching staff of St. Sergio's Orthodox Theological Institute. Their opponents were Florovsky, Chetverikov, Vladimir & Nikolai Lossky, and members of the "Brotherhood of St. Photios". Bulgakov believed that "Sophia" or "God's Wisdom" is an ontological bridge between God and the world. "Divine-humanity" is the total unity of God with the created world. Sophia and the Divine-humanity constitute a meaning, content, forms, and the initial-final stages of the universe. Florovsky claimed that Vladimir Solovyov was a conductor of Western and Gnostic influences in Russian spiritual history. He also emphasized the radically free nature of the act of the Creation. Florovsky declared that Bulgakov's abstract symbolism subjective philosophizing replaced the real Holy story. Vladimir Lossky consistently crushed fundamental concepts of "Sophiology": Sophia, Divine-humanity and the logic of their relationship. Vladimir Lossky pointed that Bulgakov's Sophia begins to play a special role to the Holy Trinity. He called the term of "Divine-humanity" as a "chaotic concept", where the two God's natures are mixing indistinguishably and forming "a new God-nature essence". Vladimir Lossky described the Bulgakov' philosophical-religious conception as a cosmological-natural process between God and Divine-humanity, as the return of created Sophia in the unity of the Divine Sophia. As a result, Holy Scripture and the teachings of the Fathers were distorted. Therefore, it was likely philosophical teaching on the theme of Revelation. This debate has formed new leaders of the theoretical renaissance of Orthodoxy. Their approach to the study of Holy history was called "patristic revival" and "Neo-patristic synthesis" in Orthodoxy.

DE "I" and "Another"; the person; responsibility; guilt; grace
AB In this article some substantive provisions of hermeneutic contour of philosophy of M. Bakhtin are revealed and considered using the material of his early products. So the analysis of article of Bakhtin "Art and responsibility" allows to open problematics of the whole and integrity which is important for understanding of his hermeneutics. The mechanical connection of different parts in one whole is opposed to internal unity of sense. From a problematics of the whole the problematics of unity which is found only in the person is born. A condition and the guarantor of unity is the unity of responsibility: "That I have worried and have understood in art, I should answer with the life that all endured and understood doesn't remain inactive in it". On the model of mutual relations of "art" and "life" Bakhtin designates the principles which are of great importance for understanding his hermeneutic ideas.The understanding is connected with an ideological complex "I should answer with all my life" and also with effectiveness in the sense of detection in activity. The analysis of this complex reveals: the structure of the person, a problematic of obligation, the idea of the answer (before Another), and at last the total character of the answer (both for myself, and for another the person). Without this total responsibility of the answer it is impossible to say that something is understood. Guilt is connected with responsibility as the death is connected with life. The guilt is a responsibility in the modus of death of the person. Therefore we can tell about the value of the mortal person and the value of death of the person for a hermeneutics. Thus, total responsibility of the answer is an understanding condition: "I should answer with the life" + "I should answer with the death".Esthetic vision opens one more modus of the person - the person as "a hero". The hero of his own product. In wider context (the early treatise to "Philosophy of the action") - he is the hero of life. "Hero" can be "bad" or "good", in any way it doesn't change his place in life - to be the valuable center. "Hero" appears as grace for us. Value of the person is to be grace. And this grace doesn't mean deleting the borders between "good" and "harm". This grace doesn't recognize anything in the quality of "the last word", or "point". Grace is not to reconcile everything, but to manage to accept everything. And exactly because of it grace has got a hermeneutic value.

AB Logic rests on forms or structures. Logical arguments or inferences - in which one passes from a true premise to a true conclusion - depend on a person's capacity to put into focus the relation between the image expressed by the premise and the image expressed by the conclusion. There are, it is maintained here, two distinct iconic models at the basis of a logical argument or inference: i) a containment model, according to which one passes from a true premise to a true conclusion because the image suggested by the conclusion is necessarily contained in the image suggested by the premise (e.g. 'If I am in a house then I am in a house'); and ii) an entailment model, according to which one passes from a true premise to a true conclusion because the image suggested by the conclusion necessarily crosses or permeates the image suggested by the premise (e.g. 'If I am in a house then I am in space'). By explicitly drawing and observing the logical form or structure at the basis of a given reasoning one could thus prove or disprove its correctness - one could, immediately or more immediately, demonstrate its validity or invalidity. A 'pointography' (or 'dottography') is a way of describing logical situations by means of points/dots: it is a way of representing logical situations that crucially exploits the simplest elements of images. A 'pointography' (or 'dottography') is an adequate device for showing the minimal form or structure of an argument or inference, though it is in the end only the eye or mind eye that makes it possible for one to experience such form or structure - this is the reason why it is the eye or mind eye's axiom that one should put at the very beginning of logic.

DE descriptive statements; ascriptive statements; ordinary language; J.L.
   Austin; H.L.A. Hart
AB This article looks at one specific area of ongoing dispute in the interpretation of Hart's "Concept of Law", namely the degree to which this work was influenced by Hart's known admiration for philosophy of language, and particularly the work of his friend and colleague at Oxford, J.L. Austin. While there is no question that the analysis of language plays some role in Hart's work, it is also clear that linguistic analysis is not the only form of philosophical argument that Hart employs.It will be argued here that this reading of Hart's methodology reflects a misunderstanding of the nature of Austin's own work. Moreover, once Austin's work is understood properly, Hart can in fact be seen as potentially pursuing a genuinely Austinian form of jurisprudence. As a result, Austin's work can then be used to resolve some ongoing disagreements over the jurisprudential methodology reflected in "Concept of Law", as a supplement to the meager insights into methodology that Hart himself provides.This article will not attempt to undertake a broad survey of Hart's intellectual environment at the time he was developing the ideas that became "Concept of Law". It will instead focus upon one figure, J.L. Austin, who played a central intellectual role in both Oxford in the 1950's and Hart's own academic life.

DE myth; the game; mythology; quantum ontology
AB "Intellectual mythology" in quantum mechanics is a "play of differences" in interpretation which is significant both at the level of semantics and communicative pragmatics. A "risky game with reality" implies the identification of a particular interpretation of quantum events with reality itself. This is the basis of the "mythologization" of quantum physics constructs. Mythologization has several aspects. First of all, there is mythopoetics of the scientific discourse. "Intellectual mythopoetics" in quantum physics deals with the "first naming" of new "entities", the "invention" of the fundamental names which lead "something into meaningful understandable existence". This imaginary "something" is symbolically indicated and explains the observed. But apart from that, the symbols communicating with the previous theoretical construct reformat the whole context of knowledge, set a new horizon for the "exposure of being" and have prognostic predictive power and the "utility".Second of all, there is the inevitable choice of any a priori principles and "metaphysical premises" as a framework of ontology due to which there is a "gluing" of the imaginary, symbolic and real as well as the ontologization of a scientific model or onto-epistemological identification. The limitations of the experience and its locality do not remove the problem of choice, the risk of going beyond. The game which is at this level is not only linguistic but ontological since we are talking about the adoption and implementation of the "image of the Reality" in practice, the sublime "image of the Other" as a purposeful guide to the scientific search. And, thirdly, there is a real personal involvement in the communication of re-actualization of the "sacred history of the search for truth", the "joint attention", the existential involvement into this "sacred history" of scientists, their immersion in the "horizon of consistency", in the work that they consider "sacred" and which is for them not only the sphere of abstract, theoretical or constructivist interest but the passion, the sublime idea, a special value and something of the highest significance.

DE social media; social network; existential being; birth; death; the rite
   of initiation; pilgrimage; wedding; birthday; part
AB Questions of place and role of existential conditions in modern person's being are investigated in the article. The author starts with the thesis about sociocultural conditionality of such existential institutions as the rite of initiations, wedding, pilgrimage. If to describe the model of these existential conditions it is possible to present it as the conflict between desires of the person and social system (rules, rituals, conventions). And the person in such conflict was in minority (more precisely all alone), in obvious weaker position, he was the outsider in this opposition. Besides, this fight was accompanied for its main participant corporal and spiritual punishment. The modern social system liquidates all possible taboos, it erasers the class, gender and other borders, it despises rituals and conventions and it doesn't offer alternative institutional existential forms to the person. Now the person is alone always and never, because he has less and less possibilities to feel such loneliness, which is connected with fear, despair, hopelessness. Further the author considers examples of existential conditions' reflection in social media. In the society where mass tourism with thoughtless photographing near the sea or abstract sights came instead of pilgrimage, the newly married couple's photo session came in place of wedding ceremonies, spontaneous parties and even virtual drunken came instead of feasts after posts, abstentions and night service. There is almost full replacement of corporal and mental experiences of existential conditions by the virtual.

TI CATEGORY OF HUMAN "NATURAL QUALITIES" IN MODERN CHINA: ITS CONTENT AND
   IDEOLOGICAL SOURCES
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE China; ideology; human "natural qualities"; human nature; Confucianism;
   socialist personality
AB In the ideology of modern China much attention has been attracted to the problem of human natural qualities (suchih) and ways of their development. The definition of the category of human "natural qualities" is given in the book "The Guidance Concerning the Upbringing of Natural Qualities of China Young Kanbu" and its content is explained. Interpreting the category of human "natural qualities" as a combination of physiological base and the influence of the external factors (first of all, the upbringing) the ideologists of modern China follow one of the generally accepted natural scientific ideas about human organism constitution and its psychology formation. In the book the natural qualities content has been presented as an aggregate of seven qualities types, including 1) political ones; 2) ideological ones; 3) abilities; 4) communication ones; 5) moral ones; 6) mental ones; 7) intellectual ones. Speaking about ideological formation sources of the category under consideration it is necessary to pay attention to the two cases. First, the connection of the modern Chinese society with the socialist and communist ideas. Second, the influence of the traditional Chinese philosophy, where the problem of the human natural origin was being considered quite deeply, on the modern Chinese ideology. One can consider Marxist-Leninist philosophy being the science base of the socialist type of personality as one of ideological category formation sources. At the same time the ideologists of the modern China do not only enumerate the qualities the person must have in the modern age, but also consider the problem deeper: what "natural qualities" are in general and what is their content. Such problem consideration brings together the human "natural qualities" category with the traditional "human nature" category (hsing) for the ancient and middle-age Chinese philosophy. The analysis of the "human nature" category is presented practically in all theses of Confucianists. Yet in ancient Confucianism various problem solutions were represented in the human nature correlation with virtue and malice. The absence of a common opinion concerning this problem was peculiar for all the period of the traditional China. The given case confirms the fact that the human nature was interesting for the Chinese philosophers as the "working material", which is necessary to understand in order to influence it effectively in the required direction. The similar motivation in the problem consideration about the human "natural qualities" is seen in the ideologists of the modern China. The problem, which the ideologists of the modern China put before themselves, is to educate worthy leading persons. The investigation of human "natural qualities" like in Confucianism has an applied aim. It allows making a conclusion about the availability of some traditional constants peculiar to the Chinese people's mentality and defining these constants as one more ideological formation source of the "natural qualities" category in the modern China.

DE the state; a network society; a creative class; a utopia; ideology
AB The concept of a network society has made generalization of tendencies of networking and has deduced its discussion on higher level: networking conducts to society transformation as a whole. Now processes of networking include four basic aspects - globalization, easing of institute of the national state, a fragmentation of national societies and lifting of a creative class.To representatives of a creative class carry workers, whose basic productive force are their unique creative intellectual and esthetic abilities. The human capital of creative workers becomes fixed capital of creative manufacture, hence, these workers lose "proletarian" characteristics.Globalization means formation of global networks of a creative class, and a fragmentation - non-uniformity of its placing when "creative" it is possible to name faster any certain city, than all country in which it is located.Processes of networking have from the point of view of national interests not only positive, but also negative sides. Nevertheless, development of a creative class is necessary, as if the nation doesn't form own, national focused creative class, it becomes inevitable object of manipulation from the outside. Presence in territory of the country of the central centers of crossing of networks of a creative class allows the nation to derive some benefit from increase in network streams. If such knots aren't present, there is a washing away for limits of the country of few available representatives of a creative class, hence, loss of ability of the nation to self-development, a perpetuating of technological and cultural dependence.Examples show limitation of efficiency of model of the state of development. Attempts of realization of scale breakthrough projects by the modem Russian state are obviously doomed to a failure. Now more probable successful subject of development the special state organization, and network structures of a creative class is represented not. Thus the state, as a matter of fact, not in a condition not only to operate activity of these networks, but also effectively to "make" a creative class. It turns out that the basic strategy of the state there is a following to a principle laissez-faire.However far not will to feel comfortably in the minimum state which completely has refused performance of function of social security. The conflict between classes and in a creative class is possible also not only concerning social and economic interests, but also concerning culture, values, a way of life. There is a problem - how to avoid destructive consequences of the conflict. The comprehensible compromise at national level is hardly achievable. In this connection it is necessary to consider a basic utopia of the minimum state as a possible variant of a solution of a problem. The realistic variant of the minimum state should lean against federalism principles.

AB According to the report of the occupation department, by the end of 1942 in Smolensk region occupied by the Nazis, 248 primary schools and 82 people's schools worked. Besides, three teacher seminaries (Sobolevo, Smolensk, Krasny), four agricultural schools (Voznovka and Soge in Smolensk region, Kardimovo, Monastirshina) and three craftsman's schools (two schools in Smolensk and one school in Monastirshina) were opened in the area. The education was free of charge. The occupation authorities created a group of lecturers who went around the region and made seminars for teachers. The task of lecturers was to bring teachers up-to-date with the new political and pedagogical problems and to orientate them from "Bolshevism and Soviet power" to the Nazi ideology. The themes of seminars varied: "A new Europe under the leadership of Germany", "The essence of National Socialism", "The denial of Marxism", "Problems of the race", "Jewish question", "A new Europe and the way of Russia's integration". But for the seminars, in July 15-23,1942 courses for teachers from Smolensk and Smolensk region were organized. 232 teachers were present. They studied the following subjects: questions of pedagogy and the tasks of a modern school; task of physical and artistic education in schools; general questions of school; organization of schoolwork in modern conditions. In addition, the course outline included two political issues crucial for the invaders: "A new Europe under the leadership of Germany" and "A new order of land tenure in the liberated regions". There were special subjects, such as Teaching Methodology and A Critical Analysis of Soviet Textbooks. These textbooks were used in schools until the German authorities created and published new ones. Since May 1943 the occupation authorities were publishing a teaching journal School and Education. Its task was to increase the educational level of teachers, to bring them up-to-date with events, to acquaint readers with innovations in education of the growing generation. There were some pages for readers that discussed such questions as 1) science-culture-education; 2) problems of teaching and education; 3) school life; 4) letters of readers; 5) information. The occupation authorities created a specialized children's journal Pupil; its task was to educate children within the framework of the Nazi ideology and to foster new life stereotypes. This journal published articles about the life story of Hitler, German holiday traditions, bad Soviet time and Nazi aggressors as "benefactors". During the occupation several issues of this journal were published.

AB Despite the urgency of sustainable development in the forestry sector and available scientific achievements in this field in Russia and abroad, domestic science has gained a slight amount of research considering sustainable forest management as one of the main factors, which in today's economic conditions contribute to the achievement of sustainable development of ecological and economic systems. Native forest science has a considerable scientific basis, which is not used in practice because of the extensive forestry. To provide scientific forest industry the important and urgent problems are justification of effective economic mechanism to overcome the crisis, stabilization sustainable development and management of forests. Scientists should be most important participants in the development of public forest policy at the regional and federal levels, and in appropriate programs for the forest sector development and sustainable forest management based on it. There are now urgent issues of interaction between nature and society. A number of resources needed to implement the social production began to decrease. There is no doubt that humanity exists at the expense of the environment, and that the biosphere provides the human with all the matter, energy and information necessary for its normal life. Lack of sound scientific monitoring and regulation of the intensive development of the humankind can lead to complete depletion of the biosphere, and make the existence of human beings impossible. In many countries the development of humankind has not been possible due to catastrophic environmental changes. Therefore, the issues of environmental management in today's conditions are highly relevant. There is an important issue of the feasibility of the idea of sustainable forest management in the framework of modern economic organization of forest production and the existing forms of business, which manage forests. Russia's adoption of international economic community standards in forest resources management means closer integration in the sphere of economic ties (economic, environmental, political). However, in most Russian industrialized regions the methods and forms of forest management are far from matching the above mentioned criteria of a sustainable forest sector development. Therefore, Russia's adoption of international obligations in the field of sustainable forest management indicate its long overdue need to adjust forestry legislation, the structure of forest management practices and economic mechanisms of distribution of forest resources in the direction of their harmonization with the international standards in this area.

DE Childhood concepts; utopian society; A. . MacIntyre; "pedagogical

AB The image of childhood and children differs in various cultures. The present thesis isn't concentrated on the difference between traditional and industrial cultures, it is focused on the fact that different industrial cultures in 20th century managed to produce their own specific images of the childhood. The European and American cultures of the 20th century used to face the childhood as quite a special "closed" world and a child itself as a special being, who needs to be taken care of in order to avoid the "grown-up's world" with all the troubles they had to solve. Nevertheless, at the same time there were societies and communities (USSR, Nazi Germany, kibbutzim and communitar' communities) which adopted totally different idea of the subject: a child in these communities was interpreted as a partner, children actively participated in the grown-up's life. The border, which was supposed to exist between children and grown-ups, in the societies of that kind was unstable. The childhood culture was structured through the idea that the childhood is not a special period of a human being's life. The pedagogical strategy was being created as both on the contrary of the leading European model, and it's issue was in uniting the "grown 'up - word and "children's" worlds together, which had as a key moment the creation of common symbols and rituals, common t the both parts.
   All these societies and communities have one common feature - they were created to realize one's attempt of utopian projects. Using some essential thesis presented by Pr. MacIntyre, we are able to understand, why these kind of societies and communities produced such an divorced type of interpretation of childhood, which is to be traced not only in the literature, art, artifacts (toys, clothes, buildings and cities structures). Not only mentioned above, but also pedagogical technologies (which used to be thought as typical for children). Using the terms "pedagogical technology" we mean a number of plays, practices and rituals, which are actual for the children and teenagers.

DE Ethnographic method; ecovillage; new religious movements; settlement
AB This article presents the results of the research of three NRM communities in Western Siberia conducted by ethnographic method. This research was done in August-September 2011, at the expense of the target grant RGNF "Support for young scientists." In the first part a brief description of communities - the Church of the Last Testament (Krasnoyarsk Territory, village Petropavlovka) anastasiev's settlement "Sunny Meadow" (Tomsk region, Berezkino) and the community "anurovtse" (Myski, Kemerovo region) is made. Then, some general conclusions are made on the results of the study, with emphasis on the analysis of social practices of the communities and their economic programs.
   The assumption is made about the fact that modern NRM communities, despite differences in religious beliefs, form a single macro-social enviromment, in which communication between followers of different NRM is carried out on a regular basis. As possible reasons for this phenomenon similar socio-demographic characteristics of the commune, aggressive external environment, as well as similar worldview attitudes are put forward. In particular, such aspects of these attitudes as "environmental" antikonsyumerizm, similar patterns of interaction between men and women, attitudes toward the institution of education, etc are considered.
   In the latter part of the article the economic programs of the three communities is discussed. It is shown that with the same installation to minimize the side of life related to money exchange, two of them have chosen the strategy of economic success, while the community of anurovtse oriented on more radical form - not to use the money.

DE Tourist; outbound tourism; social practices; country; city
AB Until the 1980's Soviet citizens had a rare opportunity to visit foreign countries. At present, the increasing flow of tourists to Europe and other parts of the world space of post-Soviet states involved in the processes of globalization and cultural exchange on an equal basis with everyone. The constancy of tourist movements became common practice for many Russians caused enormous economic and cultural effects. Markers of modern tourism are the space and the locality. Space potential is to create a geographical image as a system of signs and symbols that characterize a certain territory in terms of sense of life and strategies for people living there or visiting it.
   The article analyzes the preferences of the modern Russian tourists concerning their visits countries and cities worldwide. The empirical research was realized by questionnaire survey of tourists customers of travel companies (N = 1277) from October to December, 2010. Target sample was carried out among urban populations in the three federal districts: Central (Moscow), Volga (Saratov), and Southern (Volgograd, Astrakhan). The sample is target and cluster. Calculation of sample's size was based on data from National Population Census, 2002. Sample of respondents is quota by sex and age. Quota representative sample of the regions divided into four mega-cities of the European part of Russia: Saratov, Moscow, Astrakhan and Volgograd. All respondents were clients of travel agencies where they filled out questionnaires. The obtained data are processed by using a statistical software package for social sciences SPSS 18.
   Through and in the process of social practices of tourism person constructs his identity, acquires and transforms value systems, collects and interprets personnel and foreign travel experience. Planning and realization of tourist trips is a component of designing of own life different from others in which the motivation, geography and chronology of travel are unique. It does not preclude the identification of specified trends of tourist activity. Visits of modern Russian tourists to countries and cities are diverse, their preferences are differentiated, as evidenced by data analysis carried out empirical research. Social practices of tourism allow Russian citizens traveling abroad, to form their own identity through the completion of their experience with a tourist group.

AB The possibility of regional development is dependent upon its social structure in various ways. Especially important are the proportion and quality of its middle class, professional and educational characteristics of the latter, middle class life strategies, as well as upon the income level and the income dynamics of the whole regional population, the proportion of private enterprises and the proportion of innovative enterprises, both private and public.
   Authors are using the results of two mass surveys (2006 and 2011) to demonstrate the social dynamics of Tomsk region.
   Although the main indicators of the middle class presence are still intact (for example, statistically visible proportion of career-oriented ambitious professionals, the prevalence of the hard work as a means of improving personal well being, positive attitudes towards life-long learning and the use of modern technology at the work place etc.). There are some negative trends: social and economic gap is widening, trust in public entities including governmental and law enforcing is not rising. However, Tomsk regional population demonstrates some features of self reliance and readiness to enterprise and consolidate socially.

AB A mathematical model of the processes of personnel selection and of resources distribution has been constructed by the authors and is presented in this article of theirs. The said processes are regulated by a set of political rules (institutions) manifestly designated as mathematical functions. Most important characteristics of the model are: deprivation (individual and joint), efficiency, and distribution of political influence between individuals. All the adduced concepts are defined in the article both substantially and formally. Analyzed in the article, firstly, is the influence of the politico-institutional structure on the level of the efficiency of the system and on the summary deprivation level of the individuals constituting it. Secondly, considered in the article are the stimuli of individual political behavior, as they are produced by different systems of personnel selection rules.

TI THE ARCH OF THINKING ABOUT NATIONALISM IN CHALLENGING TIME
SO AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE
LA English
DT Article
AB In the introduction to the archival publication of documents by Hans Kohn the editors point out that Ab Imperio had earlier engaged with the scholar's legacy. Kohn's lectures published in the journal were delivered in 1919 and 1943. The editors briefly discuss Kohn's biography. Born in Prague, Kohn became involved in discussions of Zionism early in his life. He served in the Austro-Hungarian army and spent time in Russia (in southern Siberia) as a prisoner of war. The editors argue that his understanding of nationalism was shaped by his historical encounters. In particular, Kohn's lifelong commitment to Zionism was a formative influence on his ideas about political community. Kohn's early embrace of nationalism was connected to his hopes for Zionism and his search for a suitable political language for describing a national community. In 1943, Kohn, by then a professor of modern European history at Smith College, had behind him several years of life in Palestine, where he worked in Zionist organizations and studied the Arab world. He also carefully observed and reported on the rise of Nazism and Stalinism in Europe. Kohn's lecture of 1943 reflects more distance from nationalism.

DE Plato; Natorp; Heidegger; political philosophy; the idea of the good;
   Neo-kantianism; virtue; knowledge
AB The paper studies interpretations of Plato's works by Neg-Kantian philosophers (P. Natorp, E. Cassirer) and M. Heidegger. Neo-Kantians were mostly interested in Plato's logical investigations, at the same time they ignored historical and political dimensions of the dialogues. This image of Plato as a pure theoretical mind was almost predestined to fit Nietzsche's task of "overcoming of Platonism". Arguably, it was the Neo-Kantian version of Plato, that Heidegger rejected and criticized. But some of Heidegger's own key concepts are very close to those elements of Plato's thinking, which were ignored by Neo-Kantians. The most interesting case here is political interpretation of Plato's philosophy in Heidegger's lecture course "The essence of truth".

AB This article, based on unknown archival documents, looks at processes of manipulation of citizenship among the Russians in Manchuria during the interwar period. The main focus is on the activity of the Soviet Consulates in Manchuria, adoption of Soviet citizenship by Russian employees of the Chinese-Eastern Railway and the motives for the frequent changes of citizenship by emigrants. It concludes that Russian emigrants in Manchuria had to adopt Soviet, Chinese, and Manchurian citizenship for the sake of physical survival and national cultural preservation. The instability of the military and political situation in Manchuria allowed Russian emigrants to change citizenship and keep their relative "independence" until the mid-1940s.

AB This article is dedicated to the problems of deployment of the US anti-missile defence system in Eastern Europe. The European system of US missile defence is just one of the components of global US missile defence. This work aims to analyze possible Russia's responses within military and political spheres. The measures proposed are divided into three subgroups: soft, medium and hard depending on the implementation of the adopted missile defence concept by the USA. This research employs the structure-system method and the method of actualization. The authors outline both positive and negative consequences of such actions for the Russian Federation, the USA, eastern European countries and the neighbouring countries, including the Baltic Sea states. The practical significance of this study consists in the proposed and justified responses of the Russian Federation that may serve as a basis for the scenarios of development of international situation and help to forecast the level of tension in Russia-US relations.

TI VITAL PROBLEMS OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE criminal proceedings; problems; differentiation; evidence; participants
AB Nowadays there exists an objective necessity of principal reforming of criminal proceeding legislature. Its last changes were disordered, contradictory; today they do not correspond to the fundamental statements elaborated later. Besides, some great changes in political, social and economical life of our country occur. In this regard, the role of law as a science is growing essentially in modern society. One of the most topical problems of the Russian criminal procedure is the absence of a uniform position of scientists on the question of its character: adversary or mixed. In the opinion of the author, mistakes in definition of the criminal proceeding necessary for Russia caused contrariety of the existing Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation, because its authors tried to combine contradictory actions: to build the English-American type of adversary proceeding, thereat preserving the investigative pre-trial procedure. The problem of the participants of criminal proceeding, their classification and functions is one of the most important issues for criminal proceeding. The classification of participants of the criminal procedure into four groups, as provided in Part 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation, seems groundless; it does not correspond to the requirements of criminal procedure action. On the basis of the conception of the mixed type of proceeding (investigative in its pre-trial part), it is necessary to solve evidence problems. In particular, only those officials and bodies, who deal with a particular criminal case, relate to the subjects of collecting the evidence. Besides, the notion "prejudgement", given in Article 90 of the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation is disputable enough. The fact that circumstances determined with effective decisions on civil, administrative and criminal cases should not have prejudicial character is evident. The problem of differentiation of criminal proceeding should be affected. Preliminary investigation does not differ from pre-trial investigation. Meanwhile, investigation of minor offences should be exercised in shortest periods. The author proposes to restore the protocolary pre-trial procedure in the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation. One of the most important directions of scientific researches nowadays is the "sphere of criminal procedure", which also includes criminal procedure action. In this article the author discusses only some problems of criminal procedure. It is proposed to pay special attention to such questions as "sphere of criminal procedure", principles of continuity and directness of criminal procedure, periods of investigation and solution of criminal cases. It seems that specialists of different branches of law should examine and elaborate recommendations for its solution. If it does not happen, criminal procedure experts cannot avoid this question.

The period of the 1920s is characterised by complexity and discrepancy of political, social and economic processes. Sharp change of the political climate, deterioration of the social status and radical reforms in the higher education sphere were a strong blow for the scientific and pedagogical community. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of pre-revolutionary intelligentsia caused ambiguity in event estimations. In this respect, long and difficult evolution of relations of the Soviet management and representatives of physical science is indicative. The specified period is considered in the foreshortening of the processes of institutionalisation of the Soviet physics. Originally, the repressive policy of the Soviet state caused sharp rejection by the local professorate. In due course the situation gradually changed. Political disagreements closely intertwined with certain coincidences of interests. As a result, the first decade in life of the Soviet state generated some models of adaptation of scientists and teachers to new conditions. Along with sabotage and passive resistance to the conducted reforms of the higher school, organizational cooperation took place; there were processes of integration of scientific and pedagogical community with the Soviet society and its imperious institutes. The comprehension by the party-state management and most socially active part of scientific elite of the objective necessity of mutually advantageous cooperation led to original mechanisms of symbiotic communication between them. Nevertheless, the processes occurring during the 1920s did not change the overall picture of mutual relations of the power and higher school intelligentsia radically. It testifies that the scientific and pedagogical structure of university at that time was not defined in how to behave in relation to the Soviet power. Likes and dislikes existing at that time led to the strong pressure, which arose in the environment of scientific and pedagogical intelligentsia. The principal cause of it is the heterogeneity of pre-revolutionary intelligentsia as a social group. In the article by examples of leaders of local scientific community various forms of interaction of science and the power, which by no means were reduced to open opposition, are considered.

TI DOMESTIC UNIVERSITIES AT THE TURN OF THE 19-20 CENTURIES AS A FACTOR OF

DT Article
DE university; modernization; professors; students
AB In modern Russian society the discussion on modernization of Russia and ways of its realization has developed. It is obvious that science and the education system can become the locomotive of the modernization process. It makes us refer to the experience of functioning of the domestic higher school, in particular - universities. The article is devoted to the question of participation of universities of the Russian Empire in the processes of modernization of the country at the turn of the 19th - 20th centuries. Qualitative changes of Russia through the registration of bases of the capitalist order in economy and transformation of the political system were the central concept of the specified period. Universities participated in modernization processes through professional work of professors and teachers, and also by means of political activity of teachers and students. The purpose of the article is to draw a wide panorama of university life of Russia in the conditions of modernization changes of the turn of the 19th - 20th centuries; to show the role and place of universities in these processes; to staticize the problem of participation of current Russian universities in the course of present- day Russia modernization. By considering the university professors' history in modernization context, two aspects attract attention, which, at first sight, are not connected with each other, - science and policy. On the one hand, professors and teachers provided progress in various spheres of knowledge by carrying out scientific researches. On the other hand, the university public, as the carrier of mainly democratic views, took part in modernization of the political system in the Russian Empire in the beginning of the 20th century. Two lines of participation of the university professorate in modernization processes in Russia - scientific and political - quite often coincided. The largest university scientists were in ideological opposition. The Russian students on the boundary of the 19th-20th cc. turned into an appreciable political force. At the beginning of the 20th century universities were shaken by numer-ous students' actions. Students at times were radical, but by their activity they pushed the authorities to political changes. Thus, students' movement can also be considered as modernization factor. If modern universities want to be one of modernization motors, they should become not only the supplier of educational services, but also a place of formation and distribution of new society and experts.

Because of that free indirect discourse as a linguistic category is interpreted as a free indirect effect concerning study of the film art. In the first place the article deals with three conception of FID which belong to M. Bakhtin, P. Pasolini and G. Deleuze, respectively. Much of the research output links with the problem of cultural self-reflectiveness in connection with FID (explained by an example of M. Bakhtin and P.

DE metaphorology; linguistic cognitology; concept; discourse
AB The paper provides analysis of functions of the metaphor in scientific historical texts. The system of metaphorical models actualised in the system of image nominations in the text of The Complete Course of Russian History by S.F. Platonov. The relevance of investigation of systems of metaphorical nominations of scientific texts is determined firstly by the interest of modern linguistics in studying deep cognitive mechanisms and their language representations in textual structures of various discourses. Cognitive linguistics begins a new stage of studying the character of speech and intellectual activity. The language itself is not considered as a separate isolated system but rather as a part of a whole, a part of a linguamental mechanism. The analysis of cognitive processes, which lie in the basis of generation of linguistic units of various levels as well as in the basis of speech generation processes, is one of the main objectives of modern cognitive linguistics. Researches in this field develop the concept that there is a mutual dependence between cognitive and language structures, moreover, the language form does not merely reflect cognitive mechanisms, but rather takes an active part in their organization. The metaphor plays an important role among language forms of representation of cognitive processes. One of the main aspects of metaphor, which is in the focus of latest scientific researches, is its semantic modelling capability. Secondly, the relevance of the subject of research represented in this paper is determined by the fact that development of cognitive science in the end of the 20th again raised the problem of scientific thinking patterns in relation to the opposition of patterns of reflection of reality for mathematics, humanities and natural sciences, as well as in relation to the role of certain scientific thinking pattern in cognition. The problem of scientific cognition patterns in turn brings up the problem of language marking, which is solved using the theory of conceptual metaphor. This paper is focused on studying functions of conceptual metaphors represented in the system of image lexical nominations in scientific historical texts. The subject of the research in this paper is the metaphorical modelling of the process of historical reality, represented in the scientific text. The objective of the research is to analyse the metaphorical representation of historical process by a Russian historian S.F. Platonov represented in The Complete Course of Russian History, as well as to determine the ways of metaphorical reflection of specific interpretation of the historical process by this author, particularly, his image of the stages of political, economic and cultural development of his country, his attitude to authorities and people, their living conditions and response to important events in their country.

In a short and concise way the author presents the "Russian period" of Heruc's life whose importance is almost forgotten in Croatian historiography. Heruc's ideas on Croatian relations towards Russia as well as toward Slavic idea in general were recognized by leading contemporary Croatian politicians as well as important circles in Russia. Using the relevant Croatian and Russian literature the author has thoroughly analysed the ideas and political views of Heruc and the way in which he tried to present it to Russian and Croatian social elites. In this article particular attention was paid to Heruc's articles and brochures written in Russian language used for political propaganda.

DE Germany; party democracy; parties; legitimacy; democratization
AB Today, the most common form of democratic governing is representative democracy. Its distinction is that political declaration of will occurs indirectly, through at regular intervals elected representatives. One of its brand is so-called party democracy, in which political parties in fact have an exclusive right to nominate candidates for elective offices and dominate in representative bodies. It means that political parties play the leading role in the decision-making process. The rawest spot of this form of democratic governing is the great distance between the power and society, which appears in limitation of a citizen's legal capacity not only to influence party politics during the term of mandate (for example, by recalling of delegates), but also to choose their representatives directly, who (by proportional electoral systems) are determined by party tickets, i.e. inner-party procedures "closed" for electors. Along with the risk of non-fulfillment of election pledges it creates a favorable environment to lobbyism and corruption and thereby threatens the power with the loss of legitimacy. On the other side, the growing differentiation of modern society and therefore the diversity of interests in need of accumulation lead to fragmentation of a party landscape, which can threaten the stability of a political system. Not only continuity of government policy is at hazard, but also formation of governments able to function in principle, especially in federated states.
   The authors of this article tally up an intermediate total of the 60-year-old history of party democracy in the FRG, concentrating on its evolution at three levels: federal, regional and local. In consideration of above-mentioned threats they put a question about the future of party democracy in Germany by analyzing four aspects: parties' role in the state, parties' role in society, parties and party system, mediator's role of parties. Stating the unshakeable formal role of parties and the lack of political expression of anti-party sentiments at the federal and regional level, the authors note the problem of recruitment of candidates at the local level. By analyzing the dynamics of: membership size and age structure of parties, participation of young people in party politics, voter turnout, percentage of constant electors, public opinion, - they come to conclusion that legitimacy of parties has been falling. Analyzing the dynamics of power concentration the authors state the evolution from a two-party system to a fluid five-party system. They note the crisis of mediator's role of parties and party system in whole. The authors see the solution in further democratization of parties themselves and society in general and bind the future of German democracy with direct civil participation.

AB In postmodern conditions of politics visualization and sign interchange marketization, a problem of city image representation seems to be topical. In this respect political constructivism serves as the basis for research that lets consider a city as a conceptual world, as a symbolically constituted phenomenon. Thereby, a city gains one more dimension - communicative one, when the constructs of political awareness act as the facts of this conceptualized "message". An article consists of two parts. In the first purely theoretical part a model of "great city" is analyzed. From ancient times up to present days this model serves for the city construction as a symbolic world. A modeling principle underlies in the idea basis of any city constructive image formation, that is circumstantially proved in the article. Moreover, it is concluded that a city itself is a kind of model or symbolic world axis, a sacral fortype of world theory conception. The second part of the article is dedicated to the problems of outward city positioning, starting with conceptual framework elaboration and finishing with an applied aspect - typology working out of "positions" which are occupied by a city-product in the market-based political reality (in symbolic space of "cities' market"). Furthermore, the typology is also developed on the basis of above-mentioned constructivist approach. In such a way articulated types of cities-constructs correlate with the methods of their construction.

DE democracy; parliament; communication; procedure
AB Democratic transformation can be conceptualized in two different ways: as a movement from authoritarian to democratic forms (transitology), or as socio-philosophical models of transformation. In this paper we followed the second line, and identified two approaches to change: procedural and communicative. According to the first approach, procedures governing the forms of political interaction should be the object of change. Democratization is understood as the construction of democratic procedures, or as the process of changing the old ones, in accordance with democratic principles. For second approach the forms of interaction themselves should be transformed. Democracy is implemented in democratic models of communication. In modern western theory liberal and deliberative models of democracy are distinguished in the similar way. D. Dryzek and S. Benhabib argued that the first approach is more limited in the prospect of democratization.
   The second part of this paper present a comparative analysis of selected approaches of the democratization of parliamentary institutions. According to the criteria of participant's orientation, the procedural approach focuses on compliance with external rules and doesn't mention the strategies of deputies. The communicative approach, on the contrary, puts a priority to relationship between individual strategies in the process of aggregation of the common will. According to the criteria of participant's orientation, the procedural approach focuses on compliance with external rules and doesn't mention the strategies of deputies, whereas the communicative approach puts a priority to relationship between individual strategies in the process of aggregation of the common will. In decision- making process, the procedural approach make an accent on the procedure of aggregation of votes, while the communicative approach emphasize on the integration of deputy's positions during the debate. The boundaries between the parliamentary groups in the procedural approach are considered more stringent than in the communicative approach. Transformation of the private opinions into the common will in a procedural approach is regarded as a mathematical problem, in the communicative approach - both, as mental and sociological processes. The subject of democratic action in a procedural approach is a group that controls the decision-making process in the legislature. In the communicative dimension, solutions are identified as the will of the entire community. And finally, in the procedural approach, the problem of including members in the activities of the representative assembly is solved by providing formal rights of participation. Concerning the communicative view, skills of including perspectives of others in the scope of discussion are required.
   Thus, the differences between the approaches are so significant that they should be mentioned when we make strategies for democratization.

DE political parties; party system; domination; election
AB In this article reviewed the backgrounds of uprise, dynamics of establishment and development of the dominating party in modern Russia, as well as conditions, under which the different projects of the party were formed, by the example of the study of the participation of political parties in elections for the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation in the years 1993-2007. The electoral results of every elections foreshadowed political changes in the party system, though not only in terms of the configuration of political forces. The study of these elections and their results allows us to judge upon the quantitatively changing formal as well as factual status of political parties in the Russian political system, and also upon the formation and development of the "United Russia" domination in the party system on par with consequences of such party predominance.
   A change in the status of political parties throughout the duration of all deputy elections in the Russian parliament stipulated, on the one hand, the inclusion of political parties in the political system as the key political players in election process. At the cost of being granted with a political status, the parties started to possess clear rights and responsibilities, and special political functions (applicable only to a given type of political organisations). On the other hand we see a decline in the level of factual influence of parties and changes in the degree of participation in the fight for power as a result of strengthening of a single party's domination.
   The success in the processes of formation of the dominating type in this work can be favoured mainly with institutional factors, in the basis of which underlies such a political design of the system of the Russian authority, within which there exists an unconditional defining meaning of the head of the government in political processes.

TI THE PROBLEM OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN ISRAEL
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Israel; leadership; Knesset; women in politics; election
AB The problem of political leadership is one of the most urgent issues in the political science. The research of the political elite is crucial both for the government's decision-making as well as for the prognostication of the most likely directions of the country's development. Thereupon, the studies of the Israeli political leadership are very important for the foreign-policy cooperation between Russia and Israel (one of the partners in the Middle East), as well as for the Israel's relationship with other countries of the region. It is also extremely important in the light of the Middle East conflict settlement. In the present article the stages of the leadership formation in Israel, as well as their periodisation, are outlined and the review of each stage is given. The stages of the leadership formation in Israel seem to be as following: 1. the era of charismatic leaders (the end of the 19th c. - the beginning of 1980s); 2. the transitional period - the search for new generation leaders (the beginning of 1980s - the end of 1990s); 3. the era of leaders-technocrats (since the beginning of the 21st century until now). The conditions, under which the State of Israel was founded and then developed, required some special abilities from the leaders. Particularly, the leaders' authority in their political career was based on the battle experience of the leader, who leant upon his brothers in arms. With the development of the country and the change of pace, the approach to the leading bodies' formation needed to be revised. Some "professional" institutes represented by the councillors emerged, while the activity of the biggest parties speeded towards the democratization of the inner-party life. An attempt to mark out young new leaders, new elite was another sign of the transitional period in the process of leadership formation in Israel. Gradually, the transition to the new type of leadership, which was called "rationally legal" by M. Weber, occurred. The leaders-technocrats came to power at the same time that the public trust in authorities declined sharply. This loss of trust was the result of some political leaders' deviation from their original political platforms. The image of the authorities was severely damaged by a number of serious corruption scandals, as well as by the declining of the security level in the country. Despite the fact that almost all western countries have shifted to the technocratic government, the same process in Israel may end up with a disaster. The State of Israel was always in a need of strong politicians with outstanding leadership qualities, who were able to unite the inhomogeneous society and lead the way. However, nowadays there is a lack of leaders, who enjoy the confidence and are capable of ruling the country (or the political party) at the time of a never-ending conflict.

TI MOSCOW PRINCES OF THE DYNASTIC WARS PERIOD IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE
   15TH CENTURY IN THE GRAND PRINCIPALITY AND INDEPENDENT CHRONICLES.
   (GALICIAN BRANCH)
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE North-Eastern Russia of the 15th century; interprincipality relations;
   Princes of Galich; Russian chronicles of the 15th century
AB In the Russian historical science there has developed a tradition of perception of the opponents of Prince Vasily II Vasilyevich in the fight for the grand throne. Galician princes are seen either as an unconditionally progressive power, but in any case they are confronted with the "Moscow Prince". Accordingly, there is a tradition to evaluate their moral qualities. It is typical that both models are based on similar, though not absolutely identical sources. At present, it is necessary to dwell on the activities and personalities of the princes of Zvenigorod and Galicia on the basis of all available sources of the chronicles, both the official ones dated back to the end of the 15th century and independent ones (North-Russian chronicles and those written in the principalities neighboring to Moscow). Discrepancies or repeated news allow seeing the main parties of the conflict and their actions with the eyes of contemporaries and immediate descendants, at least partly. Using both types of Russian chronicles makes it possible to consider different interpretations of events chroniclers, from neutral to promotional ones. Particular attention is paid to the three Galician princes who openly opposed to Vasily II. The analysis of their actions, motives (often - presumable) and the results led to the conclusion that these princes did not act as a unified opposition except for the brief period of 1433-1434. But at that time the reasons and goals of their struggle against Vasily II were not identical. Basically, that family sought to compliance with the principle of family seniority when inheriting the Grand Prince's throne, with the exception of Prince Vasily the Kosoy (Squint-eyed). But judging by the fact that the fight between Vasily Vasilyevich and Vasily Yuryevich ended by blinding of the loser - the case was not typical because blindness was not a norm in the political struggle in Russia. Perhaps, this conflict was the cause of public insult of Vasily the Kosoy at the wedding of Vasily II. The author pays attention to the lack of available research sources enabling discussion about the personal characteristics and moral qualities of the princes. In particular, it is doubtful to speak of exceptional ferocity of Vasily Yuryevich and perfidy or duplicity of Dmitry Shemyaka. In this context, for example, it seems to be unreasonable to discuss the assertion that Shemyaka cheated Bishop Iona of Ryazan in 1446. In conclusion we can say that in the chronicle sources of the second half of the 15th century there is a lack of reasons to demonstrate the struggle between the two principles of succession. Moreover, the grand code of 1472 suggests that the only legitimate way to transfer the grand power was the observance of seniority, regardless of the double violation of that order by that time.

TI RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRINCIPLES OF PERSONAL FREEDOM, NATIONALITY AND
   SOBORNOST IN SLAVOPHIL SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian philosophy; Slavophilism; nationality; sobornost; freedom
AB The article is devoted to clarifying the specifics of the concept of individual freedom in the philosophy of the classical ("early") Slavophilism. In Slavophil philosophy the public, no doubt, prevails over the personal and, moreover, appears as a condition for the existence of the latter. The author points out that this interpretation is fundamentally contrary to the classical liberal understanding of freedom of the individual in a civil society, but it argues against the view that there is no such value as freedom in Slavophil teaching. The Slavophil look at the freedom of the individual and its social function is based on the intrinsic qualities, which, according to the Slavophils Western and Russian types of persons have. According to the teaching of Slavophiles, the Western society and the state are built on personality, which set itself an absolute measure of everything, so they are artificial associations. For a real social cohesion in its progress towards moral perfection, the society needs the absolute norm, the law obligatory for everyone. If the society recognizes the need in higher law, according to which it must coordinate all its life, then, the Slavophiles emphasized, we must admit that before this law, the person should lose its absolute value. This consciousness is incompatible with the typical liberal sense of sovereignty of the individual and his/her values as a measure for everything. This provision of Slavophilism differs from the conservative philosophical and political tradition in the aspect that Slavophiles extend the absolute moral law to all members of any nation, without distinction of classes, education and personal qualities and abilities. The position of the existence of higher spiritual law, ruling in the life of the person, and in the life of a people, gives origin to the Slavophil theory of nationality in science, art, and politics - in all the areas of human activity. Unlike the Westerners, who considered a people as a collection of autonomous individuals, the Slavophils perceived a people as an inseparable organic whole. In their understanding, each individual can find his/her own inner integrity, only by being a living, integral part of a people. The Slavophiles called the organic unity of the individual and the public "sobornost" (conciliarism). The idea of sobornost, put forward in opposition to the liberal idea of individualism is the main originality of the Slavophil philosophy. According to their theory, the society is a kind of congregational identity, a single organism. The person, in accordance with these views, renouncing some of his/her rights, just exalts oneself. The author concludes that in their socio-philosophical concept the Slavophiles did not consider personal liberty in isolation from the principles of nationality and sobornost. Thus, preserving the idea of freedom, they sought to completely "overcome" individualism.

TI POLITICAL LIFE AND IDEOLOGICAL CAMPAIGNS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE TSU; political life; ideological campaigns
AB The humanitarian education and humanities have always been the major component of the political and ideological processes occurring in the Soviet society. History, philology and philosophy made the sphere of the state ideology, which formed the person of the Soviet specialist (intellectual). Subsequently, according to the opinion of the authorities, he / she should become a support for the state in carrying out of an ideological policy during the professional work, including the pedagogical one. First of all, historical science and education as a specific segment of the higher school in the USSR solved these problems. For this reason state-party bodies made special demands in the field of ideology to the Department of History and Philology (DHF) of TSU in the first post-war decade. Serious ideological work, directed at strengthening of ideological and political views of the teachers and the students, considerably weakened after the war, especially concerning questions of foreign policy and mutual relations with Western countries, was done in the first post-war years at the DHF, in view of its specificity and special position in the system of ideological and political education of the population. In the second half of 1940s-1950s the faculty life and life of all the university was characterised by carrying out some ideological campaigns, which made certain impact on the general climate in professorial and students' environment of the DHF. During this period the life in all the USSR was marked by struggle against opposition and eradication of heterodoxy. First of all, it was shown in carrying out of such campaigns, as struggle against servility before the West and struggle against cosmopolitism which, however, had specific features in the conditions of Siberia. Serious changes in political life of the DHF, especially in the student's environment, occurred after the well-known 20th Congress of the CPSU. However, in the second half of 1940s-1950s the DHF of TSU, owing to the remoteness from the country centre did not suffer considerably from the majority of ideological campaigns though some echoes did come to Tomsk. But these campaigns in TSU were not noted by large-scale reprisals and actions. They were limited only to the analysis of personal affairs at general meetings and some updating in the educational and scientific processes. To see the reason why the reprisals at the department during ideological campaigns did not reach the scope, it is necessary to understand that Tomsk was at a distance from capital cities, the behavior of administration and professorial and teaching staff of the DHF was wise, because they did not allow conflict situations to become aggravated, including the time after the 20th Congress.

DE artificial life; technological creationism
AB Author presents analysis of the key interpretations of artificial life (AL) and gives their philosophical explications. The starting point of the article is change of the historical situation from information epoch to artificial life epoch. "Artificial life" appeared in late 1980s as a new scientific discipline and technology on the intersection of mathematics, artificial intelligence, biology, cognitive sciences. However now it is tending to become a new cultural paradigm. Philosophy is considered to be a cultural reflection and construction of new technology.
   There are ten key propositions discussed in the article:
   1) AL as an adaptive behavior - a technical imitation of animal behavior.
   2) AL as a symbolic model of structural and behavioral aspects of the living - life alienated in symbolic form.
   3) AL as a model of ecosystems and evolution in biosphere - virtual ecosystems.
   4) AL as computational models of hypercreative \ generative evolutionary process.
   5) AL as a structural evolution of autonomous artificial creatures with their own "relevance criteria" for evolving structure.
   6) AL as a methodology and technology alternative to Artificial Intelligence - a "bottom-up" AL approach instead of "up-bottom" in AI.
   7) AL as a design of techno-biological symbiotic forms - a technological intervention in biological realm.
   8) AL as a creation of new biological entities - purely artificial living forms.
   9) AL as a creation of virtual digital replicas of existing living creatures - digitized cognitive activities.
   10) AL as a state of the art scientific theoretical interpretation or scheme based on biology, mathematics, cognitive sciences and informatics.
   Author considers these propositions as a background for formulation of the "strong" criteria for artificial life (similar to the concept of "strong" artificial intelligence). Author concludes that there is a new integral philosophical approach to artificial life is needed and suggests one under the name of technological creationism. Technological creationism pretends to overcome conceptual limitations of evolutionism, metaphysical creationism and transhumanism. Its major task is explications of the "strong" criteria of artificial life and clarifications of the "weak" partial technological approaches.

DE visuality; influence; social cognition; studium - punctum
AB Many aspects of discussion about the visuality can be realized clearly if we address to photography. The photography is traditionally understood as a picture based on technical reproduction. A photo is an image of experienced moment, social reality and its evidence. If the image reproduces the form of the objective reality the content of which brings to live by a subjective act (choice, perception, construction, presentation), the attention will be drawn to the fact "how this visual representation makes a breakthrough in social cognition?". As an object of cultural and philosophical analysis the photography shows its essence with different intensity. All researches agree with it. The photography could be transparent at one moment and absolutely impermeable at another one. Often the philosophy of visual, the ontology of photography is somewhere in the middle between iconographic interpretation of the material and abstract speculations that try to catch the essence of a subject. Reflections on the photography run to extremes, they start from everyday talks and end with highly sacral meanings. According to some scholars, the essence, nature of photography can be described only with mutually exclusive characteristics: continuity - break, ossification - eluding, "studium - punctum", intention to avoid death - embodied death. The photography as a statement about "modernity" is important not only as a method as social reality construction but as a crucial complex of epistemological issues. Contemporary philosophical studies of visuality give distinct understanding about such basic ideas as: photography as a medium of consumption ideology, photography and everyday culture optics, photography of body in the framework of ontology approach. The methodology of our research based on phenomenological approach to nature of vision, visuality, photography, photography and reality, it contains such principles as:
   1. Understanding the photography as art of image creation which is able to convey the atmosphere of passed moment; as image which lost the uniqueness because of technical reproduction.
   2.Constructivist idea which presuppose not givenmeaning which not exists before the act of representation, but constructed during the presentation. Representation is not a reflection; this is an active process of selection, structuring and formation, the process of sense obtaining.
   3. The principle of social phenomenology: social dimension integrated into the process of photography, thus, it always shows myself to Other in accordance with my understanding of Other and his expectations.
   4. The discourse of trust to photography messages about singular which makes social cognition different, more complex, catching variety of social reality.

DE knowledge; Gettier problems; externalism; truth; justification
AB The article presents an overview of some recent discussions in Russian epistemology devoted to the nature and the definition of propositional knowledge. The starting point of the work are the problems raised by Edmund Gettier in his article "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?" and the proposed solutions for these problems by some contemporary Russian philosophers.Three main approaches here are distinguished: a standard approach, a philosophy of science approach, and non-classical externalist approach.The standard approach is represented by theorists who are critical about Gettier's arguments as well as the arguments of his proponents. As an example of such theories the author analyzes the approach of Grigory Olkhovikov according to which the critics of the standard definition of propositional knowledge fail to offer a strict and correct argument in support of their views. In order to strengthen the standard definition he introduces a restriction according to which an argument for standard definition is to be based only on true premises. Some other of Olkhovikov's qualifications are discussed as well as his debate with Lev Lamberov. The author of the article sides with Olkhovikov approach claiming that all counterarguments in the spirit of Gettier against the standard approach in one way or the other end up being based on a false premise or a presupposition. In this section some other externalist arguments against the standard conception of propositional knowledge (e.g. the argument formulated by A.Goldman) are analyzed in the light of their discussion by such Russian philosophers as E.Vostrikova and A.Antonovski. The second approach to a definition of propositional knowledge (dubbed as that of philosophy of science) is discussed on the material of texts by A.Nikiforov and I.Kasavin. The author criticizes this approach for its methodological problems among which its use of a notion of "false knowledge". Finally, the non-classical approach is discussed on the examples by social epistemological conception of I.Kasavin and A.Chemiak. Both are criticized for an unjustified broadening of the notion of knowledge. The author draws some conclusions about further possible problems within this area of contemporary Russian epistemology.

DE desperation; subjectivity; psychoanalytic subjectivization;
   schizophrenic subjectivization
AB In the article, there is a vector of the attitude of the Western European culture towards the desperation phenomenon defined as something Other than reason. Such markers of desperation as crime, perversion, and illness formed practices of exclusion of that phenomenon from culture. There is an effort to comprehend contemporaneity as a legitimate acknowledgement of the whole world of tragic without any true name existing beyond the rational language. In the article, there is a consideration of possibilities of formation of subjectivity proceeding from acknowledgement of heterogeneous human nature. If social order is determined by the language of subjectivity and is always formed as a capacity to generate speaking (to speak "coherent judgement"), it is necessary to reconsider the tradition of legitimate subject as a stable and linearly determined by the general social order in the situation of rejection of extreme objectivism of classical rationality and artistic modernism. We've focused on formation of subjectivity in two trends of modern philosophy - psychoanalysis and schizoanalysis, which study the process and heterogeneity of formation of subjectivity. Accordingly, we point out psychoanalytical and schizophrenic practices of subjectivization. The field of human desperation (insanity) corresponds to the unconscious. The distinction of those subjectivity practices is set by an attitude to desperation determining a motif of subjectivization: while Freud legitimates desperation (insanity) through a connection of a speech flow (of desperation) with everyday social reality, Deleuze allows it "to happen". Psychoanalytical subjectivization is formed according to "the scientific principle": Freud found a legitimate area rather limited by social norms, to which one could reduce all immensity of the unconsciousness. The structure of Ego is a centre for such subjectivity and it maintains a constant connection of all the strata of a personality by making a unidirectional line from the source, the unconsciousness, to a conceptually formed consciousness. Schizophrenic subjectivization is formed acoording to the principle of inversion, where the difference between internal and external disappears, and, instead of a strict and vertical structure of a personality, we get "surface effects" - events.

AB In the article is shown the importance for new realities of development of russian society such a social formations as a local communities. The local community (a historical, cultural, neighbour's generality of people) - is a arises of the base of any civil self-organizing. Managing influence in a such social system as the local community, will be effective in that measure in what it corresponds to internal tendencies of its self-development. The community acts cumulative social -life subject of public action that means not so much integrity and unity, how many set of associations of the most various scale and a level, and an embodiment of a wide variety of sights, positions, valuable installations. Interaction of subjects functioning in such community becomes a connecting fabric, spatial, its topological field. The organization and management of such social systems as local communities, may not be carried out in traditional classical forms. Attraction of topology to their research that provides the account of their spatial characteristics at the analysis of local communities is perspective. The topology is a doctrine about a place. Thus all spatially designated concepts of local communities, even such as an atmosphere, mood, a situation etc. Concept of topology or a topological reflection of space are accepted to the analysis, as though towers above relative space and conducts to other, more universal understanding of space, a place. The place turns around a social field and not only connects people, but also will penetrate into them. The philosophical topology is a theory of a concrete place, the concrete logic of local community explaining as individuals may cooperate in the community, considering various kinds of interaction, intermediary and allocating among them the interactions caused by a place. To build topological system of construction of local communities, it is necessary to develop system of their comparison, correlation with each other, measurement their uniqueness that does not give any another parameter of a measure. For revealing opportunities of multivariate realization philosophical direction about local communities, in article address to system methodology. Are considered different system direction to find unity in set of interpretation of system-theoretical researches in their application to the analysis of local communities, as social systems. Three system-theoretical directions are analysed: the intervention-technical theory of systems; the theory of self-organizing and the structural theory of systems. In detailare described two different types of the structural theory: operative and retive systems. Opportunities of application of that and are shown another at the analysis of social systems of local communities. Is given the concept of topology model of social system, the concept of a field is entered into the system theory. The theory of social systems is identified with retive models of systems, with their poly- centered and topology- centered versions, with the theory of space and topology. The new system-theoretical direction is submitted which with introduction of concept of space and fields enables to describe such strongly contextually caused social systems as local communities.

TI ON CONSERVATIVE ESSENCE OF THE BLACK HUNDRED

DT Article
DE Black Hundred; extreme right ideology; conservatism; traditionalism;
   basic values of Russian civilization
AB The rise of the Black-Hundred organizations (such as the Union of the Russian people, the Russian Monarchical Party, the Union of the Archangel Michael and others) on the political arena of Russia at the beginning of the 20th century was conditioned by the reaction of the traditional part of the population on the First Russian Revolution and Manifesto of October 17,1905 to defend the basic values of the Russian civilization - Orthodoxy, autocracy, nationality. This gives grounds to determine the Black-Hundred to the conservative spectrum, because extreme-rights counteracted to the attempts of the liberal and revolutionary movements to undermine the absolute monarchy. The main cause of all-class participation in the activity of the Black Hundred organizations was the commonness of religious consciousness and traditional outlook. The most important characteristic feature of the Black Hundred was the adherence to the universal Christian tradition. In spite of plenty of programs of extreme right organizations, all of them had a single ideological basis - Orthodoxy, autocracy, nationality. It was a Russian conservative S.S. Uvarov who formed this principle in the 19th century. Uvarov's principle became the distillation of the conservative political philosophy which included religious and national constants. In the Black-Hundred ideology this formula got national content, because it displayed in mental and political spheres and reflected the absolute principle of the Russian being. The problem of identification of the Black-Hundred organizations as conservative ones can be solved by using S.S. Uvarov's principle "Orthodoxy, autocracy, nationality". The problem of identification to the Black-Hundred spectrum can be solved by the criterion of defense of the absolute Russian Orthodox monarchy. Using this criterion gives an opportunity to recognize Dubrovin's Union of Russian People as a model of the Black-Hundred organization and revise the views existent in historical science about the identity of the BlackHundred and nationalist (including fascist) doctrine. Differences of ideological foundations conditioned sharp distinctions between the Black-Hundred and nationalist (including fascist) doctrines in the methods of attack of the principal political problems: state structure, national problem, conservation of the empire and proposals to reform the country.

DE A. Bely; F. A. Stepun; life; creativity; hermeneutics; translation;
   values; teurgizm; embodiment of "new meaning"
AB A. Bely and F.A. Stepun show great interest in studying the relationship between life and creativity, life and art, but at the same time they differ in determining the contexts of consideration, the essence of understanding and the results of solving this problem. Both of them adhere to the teleological approach that proves their commitment to the ideas of Neo-Kantianism and phenomenology. The contexts of consideration, Stepun's valuable and Bely's theurgical, tend to reveal the meaning of different spheres of life, creativity, and their relation. F. A. Stepun insists on the lack of coincidence between life and creativity, considering it as a basis for harmony. The differentiation between life and two value scales provides tools for contrasting completeness of life and splitness, partial character of any creative act. Antinomity of life and creativity cannot be overcome. If creativity, dualistic by nature, is measured by the unity of life, then laziness and tragedy of life of creative personality are inevitable. Mysticity, true religiousness as non-objectified experience exist only in life, they cannot be transferred to culture, which is creativity. Spetun believes that there is no God in the results of creativity, there is only striving to Him. Stepun and A. Bely use the same vocabulary but in Stepun's works it carries a different meaning. Life, its religious completeness and depth can be expressed in "hieroglyph", manifest itself in "gesture", but these signs according to Stepun do not convey it completely. "Positive total-unity" (vseedinstvo) of the soul is not revealed exhaustively through symbol, hieroglyph or gesture etc. For A. Bely rhythm, gesture convey deep meaning of both life and creativity, but their symbolic nature cannot be presented in exhaustive way in literary works. For A. Bely and Stepun sings only partially express the completeness of life, giving reason to characterize the situation using the metaphor of "paradoxical translation". A. Bely speaks about the coincidence of life and creativity. Theurgy, a religious foundation are the beginning of life and creativity. The experience of self-perfection is interpreted by A. Bely in the coordinates of communication, and "life-creation" (zhiznetvorchestvo) for him is a source and a result of his verbal creativity. The experience of self-expression as the experience of verbal creativity is directed, relatively speaking, toward the spiritual vertical. It is rather the embodiment of "new meaning" than its transmission, it is a problem of expressing, searching for new ways of existence of "new meaning" rather than a problem of real, ordinary (horizontal) communication. "Life Line" is highly significant in this respect. It serves as the experience of implementation of a new creative effort to find the meaning of one's life and creativity. The problem of the relationship of life and creativity is associated with finding dominant principles of existence and development of the verbal creativity of A. Bely and F.A. Stepun, but it is the task of another study.

DE imaging; images; drawing; locatable experiences
AB Human beings experience the world first of all by seeing and imagining it. They can get close to the world and to their own nature by reflecting on illuminating intuitions and ideas. These are evident truths, partly recorded by some philosophers (by Plato, for example) since the antiquity. These truths, however, have never been put, simply and immediately, at the centre of human beings' practical and theoretical speculations. The main philosophical investigations, on the contrary, above all in the current age, have become more and more strictly verbal. The notes contained in this article are an attempt to stimulate the philosophical mind carefully to study images - that is, to study images as locatable or quasi locatable experiences (and even images as locatable or quasi locatable experiences that are the basis of non locatable experiences).

DE analytical legal philosophy; intention; decision; action; imperative
   statements; legal rule
AB In article research of meaning of concepts "intention", "decision", "action", their interrelation and relevance to Herbert Hart's legal philosophy is presented. Through the analysis of imperativeness of legal rules it is established them intentionality. In each of the following pairs of sentences certainty is mentioned: (1) "I am not sure which of these I like best". "I know which I like". (2) "He does not know what he wants". "I now know what I want" (3) "I think I will do it, but I am not sure". "I know now what I will do" (where an entirely voluntary action is envisaged). The kind of knowledge referred to in each of these sentences, as they are normally used, would be dissociated from any possible appeal to evidence. This is the most important, but not the only, respect in which there is an analogy between the pairs of sentences (1), (2) and (3). There is also an analogy in the grammatical form of these sentences. In the article "Decision, Intention, and Certainty" S. Hampshire and H.L.A. Hart are argued that there is only one case of the kind of certainty that cannot be associated with any appeal to evidence: namely, case (3), a man's knowledge of his own present and future voluntary actions. Author's thesis is that there is a necessary connection between certainty of this kind, and upon this topic, and deciding to do something, and also that there is a necessary connection between certainty of this kind and intending to do something, and doing it intentionally.

DE Frege's puzzle; intentionality; semantics; pragmatics; reference;
   singular terms; propositional attitudes; belief reports
AB The article provides a general outline of the problem of substitutivity of coreferential names in propositional attitudes reports. In the first part of the paper the important semantic principles we should take into account dealing with this problem are explained. I discuss the direct reference principle and consider that the main motivation for its acceptance is the observation that names do not carry any information about their object semantically, and different people can associate different descriptions with the same name, what makes their role in compositional semantics vague. In a discussion of the disquotational principle I am trying to show that even if we have good reasons to reject the in its strong formulation, its very unfavorable for a philosopher to reject it in a weak formulation. Subsequently I proceed with criticizing the idea that belief sentences are the exact description of beliefs or that they are reports about the specific relation the believer stands to the entity called "proposition". I provide a case (using "said that" instead of "believes that") when the report is correct even though the initial content was de dicto and the reported one was de re (or de dicto but using description the first speaker couldn't accept). The mode of the sentence is not fixed by the person whose belief is reported, but by the one making this report - based on the context she is in.
   In the conclusion it is stated that even if we weaken the disquotational principle and the specification assumption we still would not be able to get a full answer to the problem. Therefore we should put some constrains on the theory of meaning of names: it should explain what kind of different information two different names of the same object can carry semantically without presupposing Frege's senses. The author points at some (metalinguistic) theories complying with those constrains.

AB Author reconstructs the sociological contexts of the usage of the terms "habitus" and "habitualization" as well as other related concepts. According to the author, the usage of the terms opens up the possibility of avoiding the traditional distinction between the "external" and "internal", the "object" and the "subject", the "social" and the "cognitive". The respective shift of attention as well as the new theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of everyday life constitute "habitus" and "habitualization" as important concepts for the analysis of scientific practices as well.

TI REVOLUTION THEORY OF P.N. TKACHEV IN THE CONTEXT OF DISCUSSION ON
   RUSSIAN JACOBINISM IN THE SOVIET HISTORIOGRAPHY OF 1920S
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Soviet historiography; Narodnichestvo; Populism; Russian Jacobinism
AB In the article estimations of sociopolitical views of P.N. Tkachev within the discussion on the Russian Jacobinism in the Soviet historical science of the 1920s are considered. The discussion was caused by heterogeneity of the structure of its participants. First, higher schools had a part of the prerevolutionary professorate who carefully preserved the academic traditions of the unbiased historical analysis. Second, many outstanding figures of the Bolshevik party, people who were not only witnesses, but also direct participants of the historical events, came to study the past. Third, the young growth of the Red professors actively gained power wishing to declare themselves. Besides, despite the victory in the Civil War, the Bolsheviks had the feeling of their insufficient argumentation and unstable positions in the society, so, they wished to strengthen the ideological basis by proving the inevitability of the October Revolution, its presentation as the logical end of the preceding stages of the revolutionary movement in Russia. During the debate the opinions of the researchers were essentially divided. One part of historians (B.P. Kozmin, S.I. Mitskevich, B.I. Gorev) insisted on the significant role of Tkachev and the Narodovoltsy (Populists) in the establishment of the Bolshevik model of a socialist revolution. Others asserted that the revolution theory of Tkachev was utopian, as it relied on a peasant revolt; and Bolshevism appeared despite Tkachevism, contrary to it, it was a new, more adequate and progressive form of revolutionary struggle led by working class. As a result the conclusion is made that the interest of researchers of the 1920s in P.N. Tkachev's revolution theory is directly connected with studying the Jacobin-Blanquist direction in the Russian revolutionary movement and searches of ideological roots of Bolshevism. Trying to find unarguable proofs of inevitability of the October Revolution and thus justify cardinal social, economic and political changes in the country, historians of the first years of the Soviet rule concentrated their attention on the recent revolutionary past, on the Narodnichestvo (Populism) as a direction of the Russian public idea of the second half of the 19th century in particular. Tkachev's Doctrine as the most radical in the Narodnichestvo turned to be most attractive to scientists who aspired to establish a continuity of their contemporary ideology, the practice of the Soviet authorities and the concepts of the pre-Marxism period in the Russian revolutionary movement. During that period the historical interpretation of Tkachev's creative heritage began; the thesis on the eclecticism of his ideas is questioned; their specificity and originality are emphasised; the continuity in the Russian revolutionary tradition where the Marxist component was not dominating and crucial is marked.

DE personality; liberty; interpretation; integrity; fullness; idea; ideal
AB In modern philosophy the problem of interpretation is considered as confrontation of different historical activities like crisis or even refusal from understanding and explanation. However all human being in the space and time of the existing forms an integral ontological and hermeneutical cycle, where the modus of pre-understanding serves as objectification of the existing but the modus of understanding - as deobjectification. The structure of a hermeneutical cycle is formed by the rhythm of transcendence "out and in" that guarantees the stability of being in existence allowing it to be a whole subject in history. The essence of interpretation is in the process of preparation and entering the cycle of being. We are convinced that a clearer interpretation of metaphysics is revealed in the concept "completeness", which is connected with an ideal. Urge towards completeness creates an ontological space of openness and freedom. Interpretation as a form of life creation of the person develops itself to the full only in reality where the field of horizontal dialogue is formed by dialogue with other persons. The vertical axis of dialogue is set by exiting to the Absolute, forming a life circle. In the ontological plan, interpretation rests between non-existence and pre-being where non-existence means ontic, and pre-being an ontologic, metalogic reality. In gnoseological aspect, interpretation forms informative hierarchy of movement from the point of intuition to the point of super-intelligence. In anthropological sense, interpretation makes a course global existential transcendence ( in contrast to annihilation transgressions) of humankind, whose poles are pre- and post-history where history is, first of all, the process of formation and development of intelligence, development of the subject of history trying to establish itself in a life circle. In axiological format, interpretation is constituted between various values ( theoretical, aesthetic and ethical sets of consciousness). The fullest metaphysical nature of interpretation is embodied here in an act, in life as entering, establishing possible / free forms of life. In social and philosophical aspect, we may claim that the purpose of interpretation is not only in achieving the sense of the text, but also in building ontotranscensus, where the interpreter creates the sphere of life labour. In other words, interpretation is the experience of exceeding time, sociality telos, history, everyday deadlocks, the school of retuning into the cycle of being.

ID PURE THEORY
AB The paper asserts the duality of collective action problem. On the one side, we can observe the human behavior paradox named by M.Olson, the "free-rider problem," connected with human motivations and activities. On the other hand there is a problem of the type of goods as performed through collective action. The latter problem is largely ignored by contemporary social scientists. This sets the question what social rules and administrations correspond with what types of goods.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF GENDER RESEARCHES IN EARLY MODERN HISTORY
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE gender history; Early New time
AB This article is devoted to the description of "woman" and gender historical studies in the light of history of the European ruling elite of early modern history. The bibliography of works of the analytical and specifically historical plan is given, and the basic themes, notions, theoretical positions and separate approaches are sorted out. It is emphasized that modern gender history is one of the most rapidly developing historical subdisciplines. Stages of formation of the specified research area are given. "Woman's history" appeared in late 1960s - early1970s; "Man's History", or historical andrology, appeared in 1980s. Special value for the considered direction of theoretical ideas of the American scientists is emphasized; the European (German and French) historians' contribution is analysed. The wave of topical historical publications from the boundary of 1970-1980s is characterized. The important scientific series and collective projects, and also the monographic researches devoted to the problem of gender in the history as a whole, and actually histories of the European elite of early modern history are named. The condition of researches in the national science, in general, as well as in the regional studies is estimated. It is marked that "woman's history" possesses its own conceptual and notional device and range of scientific problems, theoretical positions that developed on the basis of processing of feminist movement ideas, and it also uses interdisciplinary scientific methods and concepts of "new social history". The use of neo-Marxian theoretical model, the notion of the patriarchal society, the concept of "incorporating spheres" and some other statements promoted some new themes for research, first of all, concerning the study of vital spheres and daily practice of women. The direction concentrated on the study of the history of man's representations and discourses about women is actively developed. A new set of problems was generated within "Man's history", including the history of courage, paternity, man's honour and so forth. The consequences are analysed of re-thinking of the subject, of the conceptual device and methodological principles at the turn from "woman's history" proper to the "history of genders". The specific system of notions, such as gender stratification, gender system, gender contract and a lot of others, spread broadly in gender history. Sociological concepts, including socially-constructivist approach, which considers historical reality and gender differences as a result of social constructing, influenced strongly the language and rhetoric of historical gender researches. The concepts of gender identity, social and sexual roles and institutes of socialization gained in importance. The theoretical positions of the so-called "Linguistic turn" with an emphasis on the active participation of verbal practices in modelling the social reality played an especially significant role. The theory of the "power of speaking" raised a problem of the strategies of authority hidden in the language. Great attention was given to the study of the literary discourse and its communication with the social reality, especially during the epoch of transition. The notions of the woman's and man's letters entered the science. The Christian "anthropology of sexes" and gender discourses of mass texts were analysed.
   The author comes to a conclusion, that the general theoretical positions and research approaches of woman's and gender history have found wide application in studying elite in the epoch of early modern history; and at the same time certain specificity, first of all, connected with the features of social existence of the considered social group is inherent in the given area. So, one of the central themes became studying of the forms of political behaviour of women, gender aspects of functioning of such important institutes, as a court yard of the governor and the dynasty. A lot of attention is given to the activity of elite women in the field of culture and art. Among the actively developed themes it is possible to name studying of religiousness and, in particular, processes of confessionalization among women of the elite, the institute of women widowhood, the family strategy of the elite and some others.

AB This article based on previously unknown archival documents, deals with the mortality rates of special settlers ("former kulaks" violent migrants, who were exiled during the collectivization from the places of the inhabitancy) in the Northern Region (Komi Republic, Arkhangelsk oblast and Vologda oblast) and the census data of the 1930's. Particular attention is paid to the reasons for high mortality among special settlers, the peculiarities of statistics of mortality by various government agencies, and the impact of various political, economic, and legal factors on the statistical data on mortality. It is concluded that the documents of public institutions of various departments do not contain the exact data on the number of special settlers, who died in the Northern Region in 1930's.

Weakening of Belgrade's support of the Republica Srpska induces its leaders to resort to permanent manoeuvres and forced compromises. However, western attempts to impose upon B and H a centralized structure might lead only to the growth of tension. This country can still be imagined by as a state similar to Belgium, but it cannot be reorganized along the France model.

AB The article analyzes the activity of the Basque terrorist organization ETA, which has been struggling for the secession of the Basque country from Spain for more than half a century already. The author investigates the roots of the nationalist terrorism in this region of Spain, its political and ideological foundations, the strategy and tactics and the "secrets" of longevity. A number of conclusions significant for the understating of terrorist phenomenon in general are made on the basis of ETA's experience. The article shows that never before ETA has been as weak as it entered the second decade of the XXI century. Will the pragmatists inside its camp be able to secede from the "hardliners" and impose on them their own political will? The answer to this question seems to be the key one in assessing the perspectives of the ETA.

DT Article
AB Unlike his predecessor Vladimir Putin, Dmitrii Medvedev had relatively little success in promoting his own supporters to leading positions. His meetings with defence and security officials took place less frequently, and were more highly formalized; he met key economic ministers less often than his predecessor, and continued to meet them irregularly even during the worst of the international economic crisis. Responses to the crisis, in practice, were devolved to government commissions, which met daily. Putin's political weight was meanwhile enhanced by his appointments to leading companies and by the substantial majority in the Duma that had been secured by United Russia, of which he was the leader. The 'tandem' was an unstable construction that depended entirely on the relationship between the two leaders; but it survived the economic crisis, in large part because Russia's soft authoritarianism allowed no space for an independent media and a political opposition to resist and delay its decisions.

DE Kosovo; United Nations; European Union; international governance;
   nation-building; ethnopolitical fragmentation; minority rights;
   institutional design; Serbia; secession; the Balkans
AB The article focuses on the role of external governance mechanisms in the formation and legitimation of semi-recognized 'Republic of Kosovo'. It is stated that international structures stressed the normative approach based on positive values and political rights of ethnic communities and ensuring their political representation rather than interaction. In Kosovo the location of Serb enclaves makes territorial autonomy and ethnoterritorial separation unfeasible and the only possible space for interethnic cooperation lies at the local level. So decentralization of power and enhancing the capacity of self-government form the current policy framework. Talks on European Union membership also serve as a barrier to political pressure from Serbia and Albania. On the whole Kosovo remains a deeply fragmented society with unclear long-term political status (especially in the case of its Northern part) and effective international involvement will be a need to keep it on course.

DE politics; image; components; stereotypes; symbolic reality
AB Image is one of the most popular topics in politics and in political science. A successful image in politics is the quintessence of different elements, a multi-faceted and multi-level phenomenon. Only an integral approach to understanding and building of the image allows to extract from it the maximum benefit. Image in politics is formed as a mosaic. This process consists of many factors and components and includes a focused work of the image-makers, opinions and actions of opponents and colleagues and the objective conditions of society, as well as the whole political context. With the rapid development of the Internet political image becomes more symbolic and easily manipulable. One of the conditions to manipulate people is stereotyped thinking.

AB The article analyzes the problems and perspectives of the political development of contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina (BaH); different concepts of statehood and state models are examined. Studying the specificity of Dayton Bosnia and the process of reconsidering the main clauses of the 1995 Peace Agreement (PA), the author proves that the BaH created with direct external intervention was considered by the PA ideologists as a "state of the transition period". The centralization in Bosnia that has accelerated recently and the preparation of the country's joining the NATO aim at the creation of one more protectorate in the Balkan region. The article concludes that global processes of reformatting of the world system take place in which small nations are given the role of construction material for neoempires.

Even though the application of network approach to international relations studies is connected to a number of difficulties, which result in the need for additional research, it is evident that the potential of this approach in the world politics field is highly promising.

Problems of methodology of Russian social history conceptualization are considered, in the context of the political changes in the modern world. An overview of models of such analysis (including models that are examined in detail in the subsequent articles of this rubric of the journal's issue) is presented in the context of the well-known theoretical and methodological approaches to a non-linear analysis of political change. The focus of attention are the socio-cultural foundations of changes that are experienced by Russia, and the prospects of Russian modernization.

AB This article analyses VI. Kelsiev's role in the revolutionary movement of the 1860's. The research is based on previously unknown secret documents of the secret' police and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as on political essays, memoirs and private letters. The author focuses on the circumstances which differentiated his revolutionary activity such as the propaganda among church dissenters (Raskolniks) who to him seemed to be the main oppositional element in Russian society. It is concluded that the contact with the church dissenters showed V.I. Kelsiev their indifference to politics and their loyalty towards the authorities and thus made him reconsider his revolutionary views and stop revolutionary activity.

AB Theoretical study of political decision-making in contemporary international conflicts is complicated by the fact that the governments of leading countries continue to engage in conflicts without prior analysis of their own interests and possible consequences of their actions. Such "spontaneity" of conduct is difficult to justify logically and thereafter these decisions are often called a mistake. Such is the fate of the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in the 2000s, the operation of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan in the 1980s, the operation of the Russian government against Chechen separatists in the mid-1990s. This paper presents an original typology of behavior in international conflict. The typology is based on the principle of motivation of conflict participants and aimed at the development of scientific knowledge about the possibilities of better management of modern conflicts.

AB Many regions of Central Asia and Caucasus are characterised as zones of great global geochemical and radiological risks. This is connected with intense natural and man-made impacts, as well as the political and economic situation. For the first group of impacts we address mountainous areas with high seismic levels, large lakes and rivers with powerful hydroelectric stations, sizeable reservoirs and large high dams, high degrees of industrial activity that increases probabilities for man-induced and natural catastrophes with irreversible high levels of radioactive, toxic and other pollutants of large areas such as the Black, Caspian and Kara Seas, and their river basins. The second group of impacts relate to the disbanding of the USSR and the creation of new independent states with additional international frictions, which results in inadequate or totally absent environmental monitoring of, especially, trans-boundary areas. The proximity of these regions to zones of dormant or active conflicts promote situations with great opportunities for performing deliberate acts of terrorism using explosives, and area also able to cause man-induced catastrophes and stimulate natural calamities. Presented here is our approach to resolving the noted actual problems, and its implementation will promote the realization of the concept of substantial development and decreasing political stress for all countries located on the continent.

DE Serbia; Russia; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Austria-Hungary; the Balkan Wars
AB The Bosnian Crisis of 1908-1909 constituted an event which greatly influenced the development of the political situation in Europe in the beginning of.. century. In September 1908 Austria proclaimed the annexation of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina occupied by it under the verdict of the 1878 Berlin Congress which marked the end of the Russian-Turkish War of 1877-1878. In March 1909 under the German pressure Russia and after it Serbia had to accept the fact accompli. The Russian public characterized this event as a "diplomatic Tsushima". The implications of this step of Austrian-Hungarian monarchy did not take long to appear. Only five years after the said event in Sarajevo a shot rang out which turned out to be fatal not only for the Austrian-Hungarian, but also for Ottoman, German and Russian empires. The lessons of the Bosnian crisis have not lost their topicality today, as well.

TI CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE criminal psychology; the person of the criminal
AB Criminal psychology historically is the basic theoretical section of legal psychology. The subject of criminal psychology is mental laws arising and existing in the system "person - crime". The given section of legal psychology investigates problems of the nature of criminal behaviour, criminal motivation, group criminality, formation of criminal installations and, maybe, criminal mentality as a whole. The traditional problems of legal psychology are studying the personality of the criminal; researching the role of the personal and situational factor in the criminal event; research of criminal consequences for the person who committed a crime, the victim, the society; studying the possibility of correcting criminal intentions, its expediency and efficiency; integration of psychological knowledge of the personality of the criminal into other legal sciences; compromise searching between the ethical, socio-political and scientific bases of studying of the criminal's personality. There is specificity in the use of separate psychological methods at solving problems of criminal psychology. Thus, legal psychology borrows research methods of general psychology due to sufficient similarity of the object of research. The situation with criminal psychology is different. The opposition of the researcher and the researched makes application of the majority of the known methods ineffective. Criminalistics and legal psychology have long studied the criminal's personality. However, if to analyse dynamics of researches with a high degree of reliability it is possible to draw a conclusion on the decrease of efficiency of the given research. The techniques used in modern criminalistic and psychological sciences based on the data about the criminal's personality are basically borrowed (the technique of construction of a psychological profile of an unknown criminal, the technique of geographical profiling, the technique of statements analysing). The idea of unity, interconnection and complementarity of the biological, social and individually psychological factors of human behaviour helps in solving the problem at the theoretical level. But how true is the given position? Does it contradict the thesis about the necessity of evolutionary specialization? Is this thesis a vivid example of the simplified sesquicentennial approach? It seems the answer is affirmative to all these questions.

As consequence it is necessary the first to endure scientific attention from the result of scientific discovery to process of this discovery; secondly to see of modem science as unity of all scientific disciplines. This science bases itself on two principals. The first principal is "the cogito-tuming" and secondly principal is "between" or interdisciplinarity. It is signify that the modem science changes the form of scientific fundamentality. Therefore it is necessary to change the form of fundamentality of modem education.

Purely analytically the idea of infinity can be introduced on the basis of the definition of the natural number concept offered by G. Frege, or on the basis of G. Cantor's theorem. However such attempts are logically unreasonable, as they lead to contradictions. The idea of infinity cannot be introduced a posteriori because nothing reality says about its necessity. Hence, the axiom is just necessary. Russell treats the infinity axiom as a substantial statement about the world.

AB Political anthropology is important for understanding of political processes in modern societies which are on their way to the construction of the democratic system of government. Not taking into account the fact that the character of institutions of power and political processes in these societies is in many respects traditional (by Max Weber) and direct uncritical adoption of the Western liberal values can bring to the opposite and surprising results. The multiparty system can be expressed in the formation of the party structures on the clan-tribal or confessional basis and, then, in the large-scale interethnic or religious conflicts. The separation of powers can result in chaos and disorders (because the separation of powers is, in essence, not characteristic of traditional societies) and, next, in the establishment of the military junta and so on.

AB The state, the market, and the relation between group (individual) and national interests are heatedly discussed in political essays and the mass media. However, emotional and ideological arguments impart the feeling that public contradictions are inherently insolvable and a compromise between the needs of different social strata is impossible. What about science? Does it analyze this problem? What views prevail? These points were discussed at an RAS Presidium meeting in September 2009. The paper and a summary of its discussion are published below.

TI FIRST CONSULAR CHARTER OF THE USSR OF 1926
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE history; Consular Law
AB The article investigates the history of adoption of the first Soviet Consular Charter, estimates it as a corresponding to the level of the development of International Law at that time. The Charter improved the rules of the former Russian Code, used the achievements of science in the field of Consular Law and practice of consular activity of other countries, Germany, first of all. The Charter proclaimed guarding and protection of economic and legal interests of the USSR and unitary republics, juridical persons and citizens of the USSR as goals and objectives of consular bodies. Consular offices were to control that all citizens in their districts could have an opportunity to fully use all their rights as guaranteed them by the laws of the country of their stay, international treaties and agreements and international customs. The rules were worked out taking into account the peculiarities of social structure of the Soviet Union. In general, according to its content, the Charter was quite close to common European Consular Laws. The exception was the attitude to the non-professional consul. This institution of Consular Law was cancelled. Soviet consuls could only be regular staff, belong to the state civil service and be citizens of the USSR. Many countries followed this example appointing regular staff consuls even before the Vienna Convention of 1963. With expansion of consular functions in political and cultural areas, subordination of consular activity to the state interests was strengthened. The protection of sovereign rights of the representing country became the main task of consular offices. The USSR was one of the first countries, which introduced the practice of consular departments at diplomatic representations. The Charter mentioned functions in the area of culture for the first time; later it became an obligatory attribute of other national and international acts. The Charter sealed the Soviet Russia's refusal from regimes of capitulations in "the countries of non-European culture" mentioned in its first Decrees and treaties, it made unnecessary the regulation of the problem on consular jurisdiction in case of war. For the first time in the Soviet Consular Charter consular functions regarding air fleet were mentioned, it was not the subject of regulation in other countries. The article is written with due regard to the achievements of law in 1920s, to the contribution of famous Russian scientists, specialists in International Law. New archive materials, taken out of Russian and foreign record-keeping offices were introduced into the scientific use.

This emotional figurative perception is closely connected with typical symbols meaning senses. The other way is caused by cognitive processes which means abstract conceptual mounting of senses. Evolutional basis of the mentioned psychic processes is development of behavior and action as specific shapes of activity, formed in social genesis.

TI NEW STAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTILINGUALISM PRINCIPLE IN EUROPE:
   MODELLING MULTILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE linguistic and cultural diversity; globalisation; multilingualism
AB The article considers the activities of the EU political leadership and its educational communities in support of linguistic and cultural diversity and the construction of a multilingual and multicultural society in Europe. A qualitatively new stage of political and economic integration of the European Communities began with the 1992 signing of the Maastricht Treaty on the European Union establishing and undertaking purposeful measures on a planned change of language policy with the aim to support multilingualism and linguistic diversity, and to promote the overcoming of language and cultural barriers by rejecting the traditional monolingual policies of the European nation-states. The paper focuses on the main steps in achieving of the target of individual multilingualism in Europe, starting with the 1990s new conception in the field of education, teaching and learning,-the conception of life-long education. In the conditions of the scientific and technological revolution, formal education at the first stages of life of an individual is not sufficient for successful provision of innovative technological processes and making optimal decisions in the constantly changing world. Particularly this is the case with mastering foreign languages on a sufficient functional level required by a multilingual and multicultural society. In order to change the Europeans' traditional monolingual and monocultural mentality, the European Council, Commission and Parliament have effectively used campaigns organised in the format of "European Years" on certain topics and promoted science research with subsequent publishing and disseminating the results in the media. A decisive role in changing the public conscience in favour of multilingualism and linguistic diversity, as well as in providing broad support for legislative measures in the field of education with the aim to educate a new multilingual generation of European citizens capable of communicating in no less than two languages, not counting the mother tongue, was played by the European Year of Languages-2001. The European Year of Multicultural Dialogue-2008 demonstrated the importance of preserving the cultural heritage of Europe and the need for support for national cultures, particularly, the cultures and languages of the minorities. Next, the paper considers the role of the Lisbon Strategy on the basis of the decision of the European Council of 2000, which set an aim to turn the European economy into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy, in the introduction of the conception of multilingualism and linguistic and cultural diversity into life. The Lisbon strategy in the field of education was further developed in the decisions of the Barcelona Council of 2002 on turning the European system of education into the worldwide standard of quality. Summing up, a conclusion can be made that the enlargement of the European Union and the growth of the number of official and working languages have brought about a more active language policy in support of multilingualism and multicultural diversity. An inalienable part of the new European education standard is a stable multilingualism on the basis of special programmes within the conception of lifelong learning in the common world education area.

Conclusions and observations based upon mass survey, various statistical data and expert interviews highlight current state of affairs in regional politics, labor market, business, media and NGO-related areas. The fact that Tomsk region appears relatively safe in spite of the crisis is, in authors' opinion, explained by well developed high-tech industries, large stately sponsored higher educational establishments and the absence of large scale heavy industries. However, regional advantages appear vulnerable to federal hyper regulation.

AB The problem of the political power created a basis for public activity of Karl Schmitt. His conservatism was born of the idea that power was an instrument for making a society orderly and secure. Thus the Weimar political system as a system of political parties was seen as chaotic, as a period of parties' fight for the total power which was to be followed by an authoritarian rule of one leader.

First of all, these positive results have become evident because of distinguished contribution of the Russian Federation and its role as a leading international partner of the Central Asian countries. However, the growing presence of the United States, China and other countries and transnational corporations in Central Asia, exerts influence on the positions of the local elites, drives to the changes of the regional architecture in the middle-term perspective. In this context there can bee seen three main scenarios of the Central Asian development: Conservative revolution, Regional Fragmentation and Regional Consolidation, circumstances defining the specific trend of the development of the regional situation.

The author analyses major factors influencing the shaping of Iranian and Turkish foreign-policy strategies and comes to the conclusion that despite the differences in their state structures, either country has a number of centers participating in the foreign-policy making process.

Nevertheless significant political, cultural, and functional diversities these counties have much in common. Among these common features - domination of the authoritarian regimes and failure of modernization projects. Combination of the characteristics mentioned gives a reason for determination of institutional design of these states as authoritarism without development. The latter sounds as the anti-thesis of the famous idea that in the majority of successful modernization cases namely the developmental state (though authoritarian) acted as the key modernization agent.

To the "language of the revolution", used by V.B.Pastukhov. he opposes the "language of the construction of states and of the formation of political nations" (expression of S.Roccan and Ch.Tilly). which allows, in his opinion, to describe the processes of our country's politics in the language of science, intelligible to the modernizing world.

Investigation of the issues in question is important. since it promotes "reflexive modernization" of dominant discourses defining Russia and the Russians. The different readings of national identity of the Russians ever since the period of the famous debates between the Slavophiles and the Westernizers. can be analyzed as the elements of one "matrix", which operates like grammar in natural language.

AB Ekaterina Khodzhaeva investigates how the census was constructed as a political and practical problem in the Russian-language central and Tatarstan press, in 2002 and 2010, who the major newsmakers and groups of interests were, and which factors caused some issues and conflicts to become "problems" while others became marginalized. She analyzes different registers and types of oppositional discourses and shows the intertextuality of the media discourse on the census. Special attention is given to the problem of the "self-determination of Tatar people" as it was constructed in the local and central press in 2002 and again in 2010. Within this theme, Khodzhaeva considers issues such as the "breaking up" of the Tatar nation; the Bashkirization of Tatars in Bashkortostan; the problem of Kriashen (baptized Tatars); the special case of the Bulgar identity; and the issue of "native language." Khodzhaeva identifies a reduction of intensity in nationalist rhetoric in Tatarstan in the period between the two censuses and offers explanations for it.

AB Human security concept has been discussed and debated in international organizations and academic circles since 1994. Nowadays it is used more and more for different purposes but without being strictly defined. What is obvious is that human security goes beyond traditional notions of security to focus on such issues as development and respect for human rights. Human security is about the security of individuals rather than the secutity of states, and it combines both - security and development. Other words, it proposes a framework that puts individuals at the center of both analysis and action. This article treats mostly human security concept in its relation to conflicts and tries to answer some essential questions.

AB The content of China decision making process and the identity of China's strategemic diplomacy are analyzed on the basis of a profound excursus into the history of the "Confucian way of governance", which differs considerably from the European model. In the author's opinion, in China there appeared not a political culture, but a sort of the specific Chinese administrative behavior model based on the "moral consensus" between different clans of elite, which is now leaded by Hu Jingtao. Contemporary partocracy regime of PRC inherited all the negative characteristics of Soviet "nomenclature", but created the specific Chinese model of institutionalization and "soft" harmonization of state and society interests. However, the build-up of China's strategic power and the sophistication of its social-economic structures actualize the necessity for a new nontraditional political system for the timely diagnosing, softening and solving the new domestic and external problems.

In connection with the formation of the Kurdish self-government in Northern Iraq the problem has taken on special significance. However reforms of the ruling AK Party are aimed to a more close political and social-economic integration of Kurds with the Turkish society.

AB The paper provides an extremely simple model of the interaction of international and internal conflicts. Specifically, it analyzes the situation when investments in both domestic and international wars are complementary. Therefore it predicts a possibility of inefficiently high spending for the international conflict due to the threat of the domestic revolution. The results are debated from the point of view of several cases of military conflicts caused by the domestic regime stability considerations.

AB The process of state-building in Ukraine has a specific by-product, namely a growing number of works devoted to the so-called Ukrainian revolution in the beginning of the twentieth century. Though the events in Ukraine were a part of the revolutionary process in the Russian Empire, Ukrainian authors today claim that there was a restoration of the national statehood destroyed by the Russian autocracy. This conception borrowed from the Ukrainian political emigration has acquired an official recognition. Despite a variety of views the historians in Ukraine are dominated by an idea that the failure of the "Ukrainian revolution" was due to a violent suppression by Bolsheviks.

DT Article
DE Black Hundred; extreme right ideology; conservatism; traditionalism;
   basic values of Russian civilization
AB During the First Russian revolution the Black-Hundred's organizations (such as the Union of Russian people, the Russian monarchical party, the Union of Michael Archangel and others) united millions of people to defend traditional foundations. The most important characteristic feature of the Black-Hundred was the adherence to the universal Christian tradition. In spite of plenty of programmes of extreme right organizations, all of them had single ideological basis - "Orthodoxy, autocracy, nationality". It was Russian conservative S.S. Uvarov who formed this principle in the XIX century. Uvarov's principle became the distillation of the conservative-political philosophy which included religious and national constants. In the Black-Hundred's ideology this formula got national keeping, because it displayed in mental and political spheres and reflected absolute principle of Russian being. All parts of formula could not exist without others. There is not Orthodoxy without nationality and vice versa. All element of construction focused on personality of tsar which was a personification of national spirit, its cultural and political ideals. Orthodox outlook was the distinctive feature of the Black-Hundred's doctrine. Starting from conservative concept of original evolution of Russian civilization, Black Hundreds believed that Russians would have to put a new foundation of mental enlightenment on the base of Orthodoxy. After Slavophiles they opposed high potentiality of mental convictions of Russian people to spiritual decline of the West. Extreme right emphasized that predominance in the West of material interests over spiritual would inevitably lead toward the loss of faith, social dissociation, rugged individualism and confrontation of persons. To save the world from spiritual disaster Russia should be at the head of human civilization and show the way of salvation on the basis of Orthodoxy. The accent on spiritual perfection determined the absence of programme of external expansion. Home policy problems had priority over foreign policy tasks. In that way, orthodoxy-religious foundation of the Black Hundred's ideology was the basis of extreme-right doctrine. So, Uvarov's principle was at the heart of construction of all theirs political positions.

AB The article is focused on the analysis of doctrinal and conceptual foundations of Barack Obama's foreign policy. The ethical realism of Reinhold Niebuhr, who is considered to be the most important intellectual authority of the new American President, is treated as an "analytical lens" to approach the problem. Key thesis of the article implies that Obama makes the US foreign policy much more realistic in comparison with his predecessor, despite his image of a flexible leader. Unlike George W. Bush, he strives to behave as a "true realist", promoting the US national interests by means of diplomacy, coalition game and the policy of compromise, rather than by means of force and "hard power". Ethical realism of Reinhold Niebuhr may turn to be an important theoretical source of legitimation and argumentation of Obama's decisions and actions.

Therefore the strategy to fight terrorism should include the overcoming of internal political and economical issues of the Muslim world and adaptation of the contemporary political system to the new realities of international development. Otherwise it would be impossible to reduce the number of terrorist's sympathizers and eventually marginalize terrorist's activity.

We suggest that the principal aim of logic is to provide the ability to generate logically correct reasoning (whenever one needs to) rather than just to construct and describe possible formal systems of logic. This leads to the problem of the theoretical and computer modeling of such processes.

In what this role consists may be explained by studying of Strawson's thought-experiment known as No-Space world model.

DE minority rights; EU accession
AB The question of EU relations with countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) has been widely researched and debated both in political circles and the academia, especially in the light of the EU accession. Such issues as human rights, including minority rights, have been examined in relation to the states' compliance with the Copenhagen criteria. However, the issue of minority rights (in particular, their prominence in bilateral relations of states) after accession has not received much scholarly attention. Hungary and Slovakia, two post-Communist states of CEE, aspired for EU membership for a number of reasons, one of which being the EU potential in bringing societal stability to these countries; both joined the European Union in 2004. The relations between these two countries, however, have not improved, they even worsened. This article seeks to examine the question of worsening relations between Hungary and Slovakia in relation to the issue of minority rights. It argues that an inadequate and inconsistent EU approach to minority rights (generally considered a domestic question) can lead to further societal instability in these two countries. Re-conceptualization of the EU approach to minority rights is necessary, if the EU is to remain the stabilizing power in the CEE.

AB The paper deals with the problem of the ethno-political situation in the Upper Tisza region which includes the territory of historical Subcarpathian Rus' (the presentday Transcarpathian Ukraine) in the IX century, after the fall of the Avar Kaganate and before the arrival of the Hungarians. The problem is examined in the broader context of the ethno-political situation in the eastern part of the post-Avar area. The conclusion is made that notwithstanding the emergence of new policies there were no stable ethno-political communities in this area before the arrival of the Hungarians. It is also relevant that this is the territory where the ethnic group of the Carpathian Rusins was later formed.

Particular emphasis is put on the legal and practical conditions for reindeer herding and fishing, the availability of labour resources, and the contribution of ethnically defined enterprises to securing Uilta cultural survival. Field research in 2001-2004 disclosed how the implementation of rights to land and resources works, or fails to work, on the local level. Through the analysis of the Uilta case, this report contributes to scientific debates on access to land and resource use.

The author argue that the powers of habitus are lying in a field of anonymity because the body and the self cannot be fully thematized. Experiences take place in the realm of anonymity. Hence, they refer to a pre-personal relation to the world, they imply a functional intentionality, and a form of passivity which itself is formed by habitualization and routinization.

DT Article
AB This article attempts a comprehensive account of the various actors-including both regional and global powers-their motivations and the intricacies of the interactions between them in Afghanistan. Given that the democratic governments have put particular emphasis on human rights and political freedoms, there would be some implications for the dictatorships or tyrant-regimes in Central Asia. The desire of the US to push the Russians out and minimise the Chinese presence in the region could not be entirely ruled out as a factor in the increasing importance of India in the US strategy, their agreement on nuclear cooperation pointed to some changes in the US' South Asia strategy. The stand taken by the governments in the Central Asian states, particularly Kazakhstan and also Uzbekistan (which had recently withdrawn from the EU and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) was especially signifi cant. The author pointed out that the US deployment in Afghanistan was very extensive, with the largest number of troops in the south and east; the US was also the largest aid giver. Pakistan is far from stable and India-Pakistan ties are problematic, as also Pakistan-Afghanistan relations. The Pak-Taliban linkages have been corroborated from various sources but there are some disagreements between the US and the UK on the ways and methods of dealing with the situation, the latter favouring negotiations. All these factors will have to be thoroughly analysed in reconciling the different forces and promoting peace in Afghanistan.

SO CAHIERS DU MONDE RUSSE
LA French
DT Article
AB The article analyzes reports on "improper language," that is, language deemed offensive toward the tsar, and in some cases, criminal. Careful study of these reports allows us to rethink our perception of seventeenth-century ordinary Russian citizens' political representations. These documents are doubly interesting: first, by their sheer number, as hundreds of them are housed in Muscovite and regional archives; second, they directly reflect popular sentiment in so far as they are not connected to government ideology or official rhetoric. The author focuses on three hitherto unstudied aspects of seventeenth-century popular representations that these reports shed light upon: (1) the way in which ordinary Russians perceived the different social groups and estates (sosloviia); (2) their vision of the clergy and the Church; and (3) seventeenth-century "public opinion" (political rumors and remarks).

DT Article
DE identity; self-identification; modernism; feminism; postmodernism
AB A number of new contradictions between the personality and society, including the accentuation of the problem of human being's identity and self-identification have been engendered by globalization. Whereas formerly the individual enjoyed a stable set of norms, values, and motivations determining his identity structure, nowadays social institutions bearing responsibility for the stable identity development are experiencing transformations and fail to accomplish their functions to the full extent or are actually in complete collapse. The social, economic and political status of woman has undergone the most drastic transformations resulting in pivotal changes of her identity structure and identification processes. Under the contemporary circumstances the old-fashioned modernist views and ideas about the role, status, and position of women, the traditional patterns of behaviour and value judgments turn out to be inappropriate. One can state that the classical ideas of women's self-identification are old and tired version and now it is time for a new apprehension of this significant process. The problem of identity and self-identification has been handled in a particular way both in the framework of postmodernist theories and in terms of contemporary feminist conceptions. The theorists of postmodernist feminism have put forward a sufficiently interesting and important project reconsidering female/gender identity structure as well as female identification/self-identification processes.

AB Polemics about whom and to what extend could be charged for unleashing the Second World War, started as known with German invasion to Poland, is still lasting for almost 70 years. This article is considered with closely related issue of how some modern Russian and Polish non-academic publications treat the Soviet-Polish war of 1939.
   There is well recognized success made by some recent interpretations. New sources were introduced and valuable studies, like M.I. Meltjuhov's one, were published. At the same time some Russian and Polish experts still cultivate one-sided view while characterizing complicated and almost contradictory events. Political and national preferences still tell on final interpretations. Criticizing studies of P.Vandich, D. Zhukov, A. Shirokorada and al. the authors share the common attitudes to the ways of how to teach the history of Soviet-Polish War of 1939 worked out while in Wroclav University in 2007.

TI ATAMAN F. F. TAUBE: AN ICON OF COSSACK NATIONALISM
SO AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE
LA Russian
DT Article
AB Prerevolutionary Russian nationalism as a political movement was created in many respects by P.A. Stolypin, who enjoyed great popularity among Russian nationalists. After his assassination, Stolypin's image evolved into a sacred "icon" of prerevolutionary Russian nationalism. At the same time, an analogous phenomenon might be observed in the politics of the Don Cossack Host region, where the ataman Fyodor Taube was very popular among local conservatives. In spite of his Baltic German origin, Taube managed to become an embodiment of Cossack interests and culture. Taube's personality, declarations, and actions became very important points of reference in propaganda texts of the local conservative press. As in the case of Stolypin, sudden death elevated the persona of the ataman to the level of metonym of Cossack distinctiveness and groupness that were challenged in imperial society of the early twentieth century. The article explores how a member of the dynastic elite, an imperial officer, and official was transformed into an "icon" of Cossackness.

AB The presented work offers critical examination of most widely spread - among foreign authors and their Russian followers - interpretations of Russian political culture. The major part of them, being far from new and contributing no original ideas into the study of Russia, are based on poor knowledge of the newest achievements of historical science and on extremely subjective, often politicized approach, with the creation, as a result, of a highly distorted picture, repeating a number of long-existing myths about Russia and Russian history. In conclusion, the authors present some considerations on applicable methodology of studying the evolution of Russia's political culture.

AB The article focuses on the case of Jewish Deputies - the official representatives of the Jewish People. The deputy functioned as an agent of modernization, almost as a government official. At the same time, deputies used the archetypical image of "defender of their people" in their relations with the Jewish population. The Jewish Deputies are comparable to "Court Jews" in early modern Europe. Deputies' high culture, piety, and aristocratic pride were combined with a propensity toward adventure and even crime. The destinies and cultural experience of the Jewish Deputies have shown an uncertain application of estate categories in relation to various imperial elites.

DT Article
AB Pavel Polyan, one of the leading Russian historians of World War II and a well- known expert on war and post- war population policies, shares his understanding of the purpose and meaning of the creation of the Presidential Commission to Counter Attempts to Harm Russia's Interests by Falsifying History. He singled out Russia as a safe haven for the "Holocaust deniers," whose books are widely available in Russian, yet the Commission, in his view, has been created to fight other kinds of "falsifications" of the Nuremberg Tribunal's decisions. Polyan evaluates the political views of the Commission's members. He argues that Konstantin Zatulin, a Duma deputy from the ruling party, is the main ideologist and strategist of the Commission. Polyan analyzes his early initiatives, which logically led to the project of the Commission. He also evaluates the international and internal implications of the Commission's activity. He admits the judicial value of historical judgment in the contemporary world and proposes a model for International Historical Arbitration. This institution would be strictly professional in terms of its membership, and it would provide expert opinion for various kinds of legal proceedings.

DE peripheral countries; interwar Europe; authoritarian transition;

   regime (Latvia, Czechoslovakia); pre-totalitarian (fascist mobilization)
   regime (Hungary); nationalism; nation-state
AB The author ponders on the causes of the crisis of democratic models in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, South-East Europe and the Baltic states. Having analysed a complex of factors, she comes to the conclusion that the authoritarian transition of European peripheral countries in the interwar period (1918-1939) was appropriate. While all authoritarian regimes of the period in the region under study were characterized by three foundations of authoritarianism-Fuhrerprinzip, ideas of constructing nationstate and nationalism, specific traits allow to distinguish between three clusters of authoritarian regimes in the interwar Europe: military-bureaucratic, corporate (guild) and pre-totalitarian (fascist mobilization) ones. However, the main conclusion is: the complex economic, political and socio-cultural situation in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, South-East Europe and the Baltic states aggravated by the consequences of globalization and world financial crisis is able to provoke recurrences of authoritarian transition.

AB The findings of neuroscience in respect of organization of social life need to be more widely known and acted upon. The use of neuroactive drugs, even those medically prescribed, can be harmful as well as beneficial in a number of ways. A systems approach to the human brain/mind and behaviour (i.e. taking into account all genetic, physical, mental and external factors) is more useful in making the mentally unwell better and in improving their behaviour. Removing violent factors from the environment of children is particularly important in this regard. 'Intangible security' will be greatly aided by researching what the optimal environment for healthy human minds might be; by finding non-damaging substitutes for dangerous psychoactive drugs; and by stopping the distortion of neuromorality (i.e. the in-built basic ethical 'module' shared by all normal humans) by political and other powerful social interests.

AB Education system reform in terms of citizens' rights has become an urgent task in Russia's social, economic, and political development in the twenty-first century; the adaptation of the system to meet modem conditions of the European educational sphere is a very complex and multi-dimensional problem and its execution is a long-term process. The characteristics of previous reforms give rise to serious concern. The Bologna process will promote an effective search of new educational boundaries in Russia. As a member of the international community, Russia should consider the unification and integration of educational standards demonstrated by the European states. Since this kind of reform will demand cardinal revision of the fundamentals of educational policy and process in the Russian Federation, and therefore influence the rights and freedom of citizens, it is very important that our best traditions (fundamentality and universality of training) are not lost, and an adequate and comprehensible formula of Russia's participation in this process is found. This paper will illustrate that the use of pedagogical technologies is most effective in the case that involves participants of the educational process in real activity. "Researchers of the Baltic nature" is a modem program in the North-west of Russia, developed by The Baltic Fund for the Nature and teachers at Russian universities, to assist the ecological and biological education of youth through its design and project activity in the field of environmental protection. The three-level structure of this program involves field experience and youth engagement in the sphere of environmental protection, conservation of natural resources, and maintenance of sustainable development; students have the opportunity to become participants in Russian and international projects and grant programs, promoting the integration of the professionally-focused Russian youth into the international scientific community. Modem educational programs like this are successful with the participation of universities of the North-west of Russian and the European Union.

SO REVUE D ETUDES COMPARATIVES EST-OUEST

DT Article
AB Deeply enrooted in Russian history, the samovlastie runs through the history of the Soviet and post-Soviet periods. This particular model of power has five characteristics: (i) it is a "power over" rather than the "power to"; (ii) relations between superior and inferior are extremely asymmetrical; (iii) the inferior have no say; (iv) the only justification of this power is the exercise of power itself; and (v) violent techniques (force, coercion, manipulation) prevail. The reproduction of sumovlastie through the Soviet and post-Soviet history can explain the continuity in Russia's political and economic evolution. An alternative model of power relations, illustrated by informal leaders in prison, differs from the samovlastie in all five respects. In the repertory of techniques, a new one - "domination by virtue of a constellation of interests" - has arisen out of a nearly rational choice in the conditions of imperfect competition and other biases in market structure.

Korogodin, 1991). The authors agree with the diagnosis by S.D. Serebryanyi: it is necessary to enrich Russian scientific and technical terms and social-scholar categories fund.

Author argues that most of the transferable skills, fundamental training including, are in need of the classical university milieu and that it's alternatives, namely corporate and short term post-graduate training are both, insufficient in relation to the demand of the labor market and harmful to the classical university.

AB Today, the notion of "right" institutions (ones that are democratic and pro-market-oriented) prevails in conventional studies of democracy in post-communist countries. The focus is on the articulation or non-articulation of citizens' interests and their ability to influence the state and its decisions. While studying the city infrastructure and its post-Soviet transformations in current Russia, most analysts profess that changes in ownership or management style of the housing maintenance and utility companies would result in the empowerment of citizens. Many studies were developed to explore constraints that inhibit such progress. While this view captures many of the central problems of democracy building in Russia today, this study claims that such an approach should be corrected through examination of the role of objects or things. Employing the "actor-network" approach, we will argue that things do matter in the analysis of democratic policy-making and explore the case of reforms in the housing and utility sector.

Defining terrorism one can say that it is violence of a certain group of people towards a certain state as a political entity committed in most of the cases indirectly, through violence (or threat of violence) against peaceful citizens. It is a form of a political message, an ultimatum. One of the sources of terrorism is politicization of religion, a simplified frame of reference - "friend-enemy

TI RUSSIAN MUSLIMS AFTER THE ARCHIVAL REVOLUTION: A VIEW FROM THE CAUCASUS
   AND BULGARIA
SO AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE
LA Russian
DT Article
AB The article is based on the author's research in different archival collections containing documents in Russian and various Oriental languages relating to North Caucasian Muslims. The paper presents an attempt to critically rethink the advantages and disadvantages of the so-called Archival Revolution in the post-Communist period. More than fifteen years have passed since the opening of the archives of the post-Soviet space, yet these years did not produce a serious shift in understanding of Islam and Muslim communities under Russian rule. This situation points to a methodological crisis in Russian Islamic Studies. This crisis arises from the continued domination of misleading approaches of the Cold War period. Most scholars still concentrate on official Russian-language sources featuring a hostile attitude toward Islam and viewing Muslims as eternal enemies of the Russian state. The voices of Russia's Muslims are fundamentally neglected or misunderstood by contemporary historians, who rely on sources produced by tsarist and Soviet officials. In order to capture these voices scholars should turn to Arabic sources and evidence emanating from local Muslim communities in imperial and early Soviet Russia. These sources may be found in central state and private archival collections. They comprise a vast body of official documents and narrative materials that shed light on the inner life of Muslim communities and their relationship with the state. In view of these variegated archival collections, it appears that the history of Islam and Muslim communities in Russia should be represented through the model of entangled history. Knowledge of written Islamic sources in the Arabic language or script is essential to this entangled history. Yet, Arabic was just one medium in an intricate and constantly changing hierarchy of oral and written languages used by Muslim subjects in the Caucasian borderland of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. Various types of first-hand sources present conflicting stories, yet also complement each other. Their comparative synchronic analysis allows for a more complicated, more credible and more dynamic picture of Muslim life at a local or micro-historical level. Bobrovnikov also points out that the archival sources dealing with nineteenth and twentieth century Russian Muslims of the Caucasus borderland are scattered all over the world. This article presents archival findings from the collections of Dagestan and Bulgaria. In Sofia there is a rich collection of Ottoman legal records and financial documents many of which pertain to the history of the nineteenth century Muslim emigration (muhajirun) from the Caucasus and other regions the Russian Empire. Drawing on these sources, Bobrovnikov shows the importance of further studies on a variety of themes: the conceptual languages of state documentation of Islam; the construction and/or perversion of social and political meaning in the process of translating official documents pertaining to Islam in a multilingual milieu; authors and actors of Islamic discourse and activism in the Russian Caucasus; the criteria and underlying ideological messages of statistics; and the role of oral histories in local Muslim discourse concerning Islam and the Empire.

The author analyzes bilateral character of the relevant transformations: the shrinking number and volume of sovereign powers of the states, as well as their voluntary sanctioning of their limited sovereignty. In this context, the current growth of separatist and nationalist trends and prospects of formation of new institutional basis for supranational integration are considered.

AB The author underlines that during the Great Patriotic War fighting against economic crimes had both economic importance and military and political importance. Embezzlements in the Udmurt Republic most frequently took place on the objects dealing with processing, keeping and selling of food provisions. Speculation especially by agricultural products made a great damage to the economy of the whole country. The Socialist Property Embezzlement and Speculation Department was an effective instrument in the fighting against those crimes. The author thinks that studying the experience of the activity of the Socialist Property Embezzlement and Speculation Department during 1941-1945 has historical significance and makes it possible to improve the activity of the apparatus of the Property Embezzlement Department nowadays during the modern period of the development of our state.

It were the events of May 1968 in France, unexpected both for the public opinion and for the scientists, that served as the cause for the writing of it. It were the "new left", bearers of "post-material" values, that appeared then in the political scene. This outburst, by nobody predicted, made one ponder over correlation of tendencies of evidently mass character, that are fixed by sociological polls, on the one hand, and historical reality engendered as a result of actions on the part of some or other actors manifesting themselves differently - on the other. The work presents indubitable historical interest as an illustration of the uneasiness of the ways by which the science of society was developing at the Soviet time, and, besides, some of the considerations and approaches the article included, haven't lost their topicality even today.

In the author's opinion, its development in the 2000s is objectively hampered by a number of antidemocratic tendencies of Russian politics. Discussions on a number of topical problems have been in fact cut down, which hinders their scientific study. However in a converted form discussions on modern political problems continue at most unexpected sites. As a vivid example, the author of the article draws the reader's attention to the development of a corresponding political discourse in a number of works by modern Russian writers of science fiction.

TI ON THE TEXTBOOK THE NORTH CAUCASUS WITHIN THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE
SO AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE
LA Russian
DT Review
AB In his review of the volume North Caucasus within the Russian Empire, Vladimir Lapin advances a general criticism of the lack of novelty in historical interpretation. In particular, he criticizes the volume for underappreciating the difference in political culture between the authorities of the Russian Empire and the peoples of region in explaining the nature and evolution of the imperial encounter with the North Caucasus. His criticism also includes the volume's relative neglect of logistical-technological and military aspects of the functioning of the imperial army in the region. The central criticism of Lapin's review is addressed toward the notion of the Caucasian War as it is narrated in the volume. He concludes that this description follows a traditional narrative of the Caucasian War from 1817 through 1859 and 1864. This epic narrative of struggle borrowed largely from the self-representation of imperial authorities and military elites ignores the routine violence in the encounter between the Empire and peoples of the region, both in the eighteenth century and after the symbolically fixed date of 1864. The review also gives an overview of historiographic vicissitudes and battles of the Soviet period over the question of relations between the North Caucasus and the Russian Empire and defends the recent trend in historiography as represented by the works of M. Bliev.

AB The article describes the life and creative activities of William Frank Buckley, Jr., (who died in February, 2008) founder, ideological inspirer and the most eminent advocate of American conservatism. Much attention is given to the US right-wing press and especially to the National Review journal (appears since 1955) - a popular conservative publication whose editor-in-chief for a long time was Buckley. The article also discloses the role that Buckley used to play in American conservatism as political and intellectual movement; his criticism against liberal ideology and politics; laudation by him of the principal values of conservatism, such as revelation, church, tradition and family; Buckley's attitude towards the national question.

DT Article
AB The author returns to the question of phenomenon of power. In his opinion, the main object of current researches in political science is not the essence power as such, but forms of power, its institutional structures etc. In other words, the problem of essence of power, of its ontology is reduced to investigations of forms of its realization. Giving attention to the wide spread of "magic" practices of direct control of political behavior, the author poses the task of constructing an initial classification of ontological aspects of wielding power, which would be based on criticizing purely rational models of human consciousness.

Some most dangerous regions at the territories of above mentioned countries are under consideration and they are characterized. the mountain lands with the high seismic level; the largest rivers with the powerful hydroelectric stations, sizeable reservoirs and huge high dams; the man-induced high industrial activity, that increases probabilities for occurrence man-induced and natural catastrophes with irreversible huge radioactive, toxic and other hazard pollutions of large territories, Black, Caspian and Kara Seas and their water river's basins; high opportunity to perform deliberate attacks of terrorists with the using of explosives, that are able to cause man-induced catastrophes and stimulate natural calamities. The implementation of our approach will be promote the realization of concept of substantial development and decreasing of political stress for all countries, located at the continent.

SO HISTORY OF POLITICAL THOUGHT

DT Article
AB This article offers a close reading of Hannah Arendt's book On Revolution. It exposes the ambivalence of Arendt with regard to tragedy and mimesis. This ambivalence is not just her own; it is inherent in the treatment of tragedy and mimesis throughout the history of political thought. In spite of Arendt's argument that privileges the limited American Revolution against the boundless French one, in her rhetoric and in her storytelling Arendt presents a unitary but dialectical picture of revolution, where suffering and foundation are inseparably intertwined. The founding public action of revolutionaries implies a crisis of mimetic passions (of fear and pity) which threatens to undo, but also set the stage for, revolution. This negative, passionate and passive side of revolution helps us to come to terms with the non-productive but emancipatory revolutions in the Eastern Europe of 1989-91.

The author relates the social-political events leading to the propagation of the anti-tsarist mood among the young intelligentsia and describes the students' vanguard role in the struggle of the urban middle class. The events related to the student movement throughout 1905 are presented as a reaction to the government's repressive policy against pupils and students.

TI The perception of the abolition of serfdom in Russia by French diplomats
   stationed in St. Petersburg (1856-1863)
SO CAHIERS DU MONDE RUSSE
LA Russian
DT Article
AB This study is based on documents housed in the archives of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It observes the reaction of French diplomats stationed in St. Petersburg to the implementation of the agrarian reform in Russia. It spans a six-year period, starting with Alexander II's 1856 declaration in which the tsar publicly - and for the first time - proclaimed his intention to abolish serfdom, and ending in March 1863 with the French diplomats' preliminary conclusions on those two years of agrarian reform.
   Analysis of dispatches sent by the French Embassy in Russia shows that diplomats unanimously approved Alexander's reformatory endeavors. At first, the Manifesto of February 19 had an exhilarating effect on them as well as on the Russian intelligentsia, but the first outbursts of peasant unrest soon eroded their confidence in a favorable outcome of the reform. They even thought that terrible social upheaval threatened the Russian Empire. In February 1863, the relatively successful outcome of the past two years of transition spent implementing Alexander's reform restored the French political observers' optimism. As of March 1863, the French Embassy was fully convinced that Russia would successfully maneuver between the risks involved in the reform and the threat of revolution. The diplomats finally concluded that Alexander's reforms would open new frontiers to Russia's historical development and eventually lead the country to Europeanization. The notes taken by the French diplomats during the period of preparation and implementation of the reform (1856-1863) are of great interest to research insofar as they are the first accounts of the reaction of the "European conscience" to one of the most important events in the history of Russia.

AB The threat of nuclear terrorism in the United States has led its leadership to contemplate an extreme military response-namely, nuclear preemption. To some preemption proponents, nuclear weapons are no longer considered the option of last resort. This article argues that reducing the nuclear threshold for some international actors and not others is perhaps just as dangerous as the proliferation the nuclear preemption doctrine is trying counter. The nuclear "taboo" has once again ceased to exist.

TI Chinggis Khan in the Identity Practices of Modern Buryats
SO INNER ASIA
LA English
DT Article
DE Chinggis Khan; identity; Buryatia; modern scholars
AB In the identity discourse of Post Soviet Buryatia the modelling of ethnic boundaries has priority, and the ethnic marker 'Buryat' is increasingly replaced by the wider marker 'Buryat- Mongol.' In this way a revitalised historical memory allows the synonymising of ethnicity and political identity. This move inspires elites in their construction of a new mythology, in which the glorious pages of the Mongol empire and Chinggis Khan have become the basis of a new discourse. The article shows how elites use the 'confirmations' that are allegedly preserved in the legends to affirm their identity. Such ideas include, that it is in the territory of ethnic Buryatia that the most sacred places connected to Chinggis Khan are located (his birthplace, throne, and burial place). Furthermore, Chinggis Khan is 'privatised': his Buryat origin and even the Buryat sources of the Mongol empire is 'proved.' Positive features of Chinggis's character and intentions, and his progressive activities in the creation of 'Eurasian' and 'global' space, are emphasised. The discourse asserts the globalising character of his activities not only in the lay sense and not only regarding the past. The article discusses how the quoted texts both implicitly and explicitly contain the idea that a happy future for the Buryats is inevitably determined by their ties with Chinggis Khan and the loci connected with him, an idea which sacralises and cosmologises the territories where Buryats reside.

TI ECONOMY AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT
SO EKONOMSKI PREGLED
LA English
DT Article
AB Market reforms in the post-socialist countries have brought into sharp focus the problem of interconnection and interaction between the economy and the social environment. The economy is inseparable from politics and the operation of the political system, from the state of the social consciousness, the moral and cultural level of the population and from many other aspects of human life and behavior, in short, from everything that can be described by the concept of social environment. Society in every country is a single organism with closely interconnected and interacting parts and systems. Their conjugation and mutual influence are not always apparent and are often overlooked. It is quite easy to see how changes in policy affect the economy and then trace the feedback effect of the economy on policy. It is more difficult to discern the direct and feedback relationship of the economy with administrative relations, with the state of culture, science, morals and public opinion. Meanwhile, an underestimation of these mutual influences is a frequent cause of failures in socio-economic transformation. It is to be regretted that the reforms in Russia were accompanied by a dangerous disruption not only of the economy, but also of the entire system of social relations. What was primary here and what was secondary? In order to answer this question the paper takes a theoretical look at the problem of interaction between the economy and the social environment.

AB The world is experiencing an intricate period of changes and new dimensions in international relations. Other issues prevalent in international life are the problems of international terrorism together with other modern challenges and threats including weapons of mass destruction. There have been official visits at state levels between Russia and India, between China and India and between Russia and China. Intensive political contacts and trade collaboration between our countries on a bilateral level have been significant developments in the present. An important event has been the trilateral meeting of the foreign ministers of India, China and Russia in Vladivostok. In a Joint Communique, it was highlighted that strategic cooperation between the three countries is not directed against any other country Russia, India and China continue to look for effective ways of developing a constructive partnership with the United States. The vital issue today remains the problem ofstrengthening the leading role of the United Nations (UN), justified reformation of this organisation by considering the interests of majority of members of the world community. Russia, as well as its Indian and Chinese friends, continues to proceed from the fact that the central role of uniting the efforts of the world community in deciding the key issues must belong to the UN.

LA Russian
DT Article
AB Sergei Abashin suggests two reasons for the relative isolation of indigenous Central Asian scholarship. The first is the officially supported Soviet theory of etnos, which proved to be a useful tool for describing independent nationhood in ways different from the Marxist orthodoxy. At the same time, Abashin suggests that the often arrogant critique of the Soviet legacy by Western scholars contributes to the relative isolationism of Central Asian scholarship. In Abashin's view, "constructivist" approaches to the history of Central Asian nations should go beyond conspiracy theory and attempt to answer questions about the relative success of the massive reconfiguration of Central Asia's social and political map that was Soviet nation-building. Moreover, these approaches tend to reproduce the nation-centered historical paradigm, while the task now is to include various ethnic, confessional, and social groups in a new non-ethnic and non-nation-centered history of Central Asia.

AB The article deals with the eastward expansion of the Muscovite state between the fourteenth century and the middle of the sixteenth. The annexation of gigantic territories in the northeastern Russian plain and across the Urals is seen as a process of integration of the population into the Muscovite political system and social structure. The author uses the example of Perm' Vychegodskaia, Perm' Velikaia and the Vogul princedoms to illustrate the different ways in which the Muscovite state incorporated new territory. Lands were selected according to the grand princes' means and agendas, the natives' social, political and economic development, and the state of foreign affairs. The article also attempts to answer the much debated questions concerning the annexation of the lands of the Komi and Zyriane (Perm' Vychegodskaia).

DT Article
AB The article by Tatiana Skrynnikova focuses on the image of Chinggis Khan in the historical memory of contemporary Buryat society and on the way the image is used in identity formation and affirmation. More specifically, the article explores the input of Buryat intellectuals and politicians to the multifaceted debate on Buryat identity. Skrynnikova notes the existence of two opposing images of Chinggis Khan: one that features him as part of Buddhist culture, and another that portrays him as a symbol of pan-Mongol unity. It is the latter image that has been most frequently employed by contemporary Buryat intellectuals in the postcommunist national "awakening." The author analyzes how the contemporary construction of Buryat realms of memory related to the Mongol ethnic, cultural, and political unity has resulted in discourses on the organic Mongol identity of the Buryat people.

SO SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
AB "Quality of life and local governance under conditions of social modernization" proceeds from the idea of close interrelations between quality of life and functional effectiveness of local governance institutions. The range and quality of services for citizenship by municipalities affect both well being of people involved and realization of their political and civic rights, cultural demands, and effective 'feed-back' to the state and society. This fact, in its turn, hinders perfection of governance structures and making of civil society. The study by the authors permits to state that public moods focus on humanitarian expectations linked to social contents of current reforms. Impact of social modernization on the quality of life is uneven and contradictory due to lacking legal basis for reforms and their implementation. Improved local governance might widen popular participation in social innovations furthering progress in life quality.

Media-globalization appears of the authors as but a source and component part in globalization process along with emergence of global media industries and their activities. Logic of debates related to cultural and ideological impact of media globalization is followed up, and Russian contexts of the above issues are discussed in detail. The issue as a whole is stated to be a challenge for current nation-states. New configuration of political and economic forces is seen as a pre-requisite for a set of conceptual and practical steps to minimize actual and eventual negative impact of global trends in mass media.

DT Article
AB "Fateful 1937(th)" commemorates tragic events of 1937-38 in Stalinist Russia. Departing from many legends related to the events of these years authors draws attention to the fact that recent archival findings have enabled scholars to assess real scale of atrocities committed by Stalin's regime in the era of massive repression. Two interrelated questions are in the center of authors deliberations: what had caused the repression and why had their peak occurred in 1937-38? In author's opinions, Stalin while aiming at elimination of his political opponents and strengthening his personal Power, had unleashed mass repression, i.a., by giving rise to a wave of voluntary denunciations. Dating of these atrocities is, so Rybakovski, linked to the moment, when decisive steps towards this goal had to be,made out of power-struggle considerations. The paper is based on statistical information and contains, i.a., author's estimate of the losses suffered by the then Russia Russian Soviet federative socialist republic.

AB "Political Sociology. Charisma in political leadership" brings a series of case-studies on the issue of charisma in political leadership authored by R. Eatwell (Great Britain) and three teams of sociologists from Russia, Bielorussia, and Ukraine. Their papers set forth tentative results of an international study arranged with generous INTAS support in the three post-soviet republics of Russia, Bielarus', and Ukraine respectively in 2000 to 2002. Attempts to measure charismatic potentials in these countries yielded sufficient ground to sociologically discuss the topic of charisma in contemporary politics in various political settings, as well as its meaning for scholarly understanding specifics of political leadership in post-soviet public space.

Interviews with a number of top experts close to power relationships in mass communication media (in two oblasts of Russia - Yaroslavl and Samara) serve as prime empirical base for the paper. This empirical base allows reproducing principal discourse agenda about regional mass media and influence avenues of various actors (politics or businesses in the main) on regional politics in the sphere in question. Models of interrelations between regional power elite and media are formulated, i.a., model of patronage and that of partnership. Mass media orientations are scrutinized related to eventual political conjuncture taking its shape in the regions discussed.

ID SCIENTIFIC THEORIES
AB "What is sociological theory?" asserts that sociological theory means certain kind of sociological practices both live and objectified in texts. Structures construed by sociology relate not to social reality, but to models built in accordance to it. Subjectivity and intentionality are, so Katchanov, functions of social forms, relations, schemes, but not something prime. Thus opposition of subject to object is eliminated, and indirect communication, along with social and political dimensions, become obvious in theoretical knowledge. Hence, practices of sociological theorizing cannot be reduced to applications of theories. Doxic experience of 'theorizer' should be taken into consideration as well, for space/time, social relations and academic practices do in fact play the role of limits for sociological theory.

AB "Socialism analysis in V, Pareto's work, 1898-1903" (by Andrey Zotov) analyses Pareto's "Socialist systems" (1901), - a major political and sociological treatise centered on the issues of socialism. V. Pareto (1848-1923) critic of socialism as a social movement and a sum of doctrines is discussed in its theoretical and methodological bases. The article is limited to elucidation of socialism in its 'objective aspect', i.e., as historical prototypes of socialist organization in real socialist systems. Pareto's criticism is aimed at rejection of socialism as a mono linear progressive development and at proving a cyclic nature of transformations in the contemporary societies.

Sorokin in historical statistics of social fluctuations (major break-downs and disorganization of social, political systems and civilizations) during some eight thousand years of human history (basically when working on his major treatise of <<The Social and Cultural Dynamics>>). Proceeding from the ideas set fort in A.N. Engelhard's works, P. Sorokin had gone increasingly differing ways with evolutionary sociological tradition to see nothing but pathology in breaks of functioning social systems (turmoil, revolutions, and wars), as well as to treat social crises-as an quasi-unavoidable phenomenon, an "iron law" in social life.

General social content of sociologist's experience comes eventually into appearance in the form of definitial schemes for his/her theorizing. Thus, prospect is pled for discovering a certain primary horizon of the theory, its social foundation seen by the author in positions of scholarly and political production which are objectified by sociological theory.

AB "Political self-determination of regional elite" presents an analysis of the political orientation choice by various groups of regional power, business, top managerial elite. The study is based on soft in-depth-interviews with the members of elite groups and regional experts in two Russian regions of Perm and Rostov, as well as relevant press data. It is concluded that regional elite does not feature a developed political consciousness, their position being determined by electorate's specific preferences and power constellation at the federal level. In their political preferences, elite members are guided by pragmatic orientations such as benefits for the region. Real behavior of elite members is characterized as effect of 'diversified orientations and efforts'.

AB "Sociopolitical strategies for Russia's development" (by Victor Levashov) looks into the issues of sociopolitical developments surfacing in Russia at the end of the millenium. A systems approach to the balance sheet of the century is suggested to support a plea for strategic correctives in the development of Russian society and state. A choice of eventual social and political strategies is formulated embracing liberal fundamentalism, oligarchic autarky, and social solidarity. Certain foci for sociopolitical consolidation of the society and state are argued for to launch a strategy of social solidarity and sustainable development.
