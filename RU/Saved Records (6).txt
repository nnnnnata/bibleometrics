AB This study examines the dynamic impact of institutional quality (control of corruption, govern-ment effectiveness, political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law, and voice and account-ability) on financial inclusion across seventy-three developing countries. We conduct multiple dynamic-panel-data approaches to address potential heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependency, and endogeneity issues. Our findings reveal that institutional quality promotes both the access to and the use of formal financial services in developing countries. More specifically, economic growth, human development index, domestic credit, financial development index (the depth & access to finance, and the efficiency of financial institutions and financial markets), and re-mittances significantly contribute to financial inclusion. Our findings also confirm our proposition that human development plays a significant role in driving financial inclusion. This study pro-vides several practical policy implications to developing countries aiming to strengthen their institution-induced financial market deepening.

AB During the Holocene, the scale and complexity of human societies increased markedly. Generations of scholars have proposed different theories explaining this expansion, which range from broadly functionalist explanations, focusing on the provision of public goods, to conflict theories, emphasizing the role of class struggle or warfare. To quantitatively test these theories, we develop a general dynamical model based on the theoretical framework of cultural macroevolution. Using this model and Seshat: Global History Databank, we test 17 potential predictor variables proxying mechanisms suggested by major theories of sociopolitical complexity (and >100,000 combinations of these predictors). The best-supported model indicates a strong causal role played by a combination of increasing agricultural productivity and invention/adoption of military technologies (most notably, iron weapons and cavalry in the first millennium BCE).

AB We examine current differences in trust levels within the countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU) and trace their origins back to the system of forced labor during Stalin, which was marked by high incarceration rates and harsh punishments. We explore whether those exposed to knowledge about the repressions became less trusting and transferred this social norm to future generations and communities. We argue that political repressions were more salient and visible to local communities living near forced labor camps (gulags), which symbolized the harshness of Stalin's regime. Combining contemporary survey data with the geolocation of forced labor camps, we find that living near former gulags lowers present-day social trust and civic engagement. These effects are independent of living near places where Stalin's victims were arrested. Moreover, they are above and beyond any experiences with war or civil conflict that the extant literature documents, indicating that the gulag system's repressiveness is a crucial trigger of the mistrust culture within the FSU countries today. As such, we furnish novel evidence on how past political repression matters for current socioeconomic outcomes. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Scholars report contradictory findings regarding whether citizens trust media in autocracies. Relying on focus group methodology, this study uses Russian television viewers' reception of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to investigate media perception in an autocracy. It argues that citizens in non-democracies lack the opportunities, motivation and tools to substantively process news. When perceiving news, they express both critical and supportive reactions towards the regime without integrating them into coherent views and thus support authoritarian equilibrium by being unable to articulate consistent opinions. This argument helps to explain the paradoxes of media (dis)trust and clarifies the process of media perception in authoritarian political systems.

AB During the Great Recession, governments across the continent implemented austerity policies. A large literature claims that such policies are surprisingly popular and have few electoral costs. This article revisits this question by studying the popularity of governments during the economic crisis. The authors assemble a pooled time-series data set for monthly support for ruling parties from fifteen European countries and treat austerity packages as intervention variables to the underlying popularity series. Using time-series analysis, this permits the careful tracking of the impact of austerity packages over time. The main empirical contributions are twofold. First, the study shows that, on average, austerity packages hurt incumbent parties in opinion polls. Secondly, it demonstrates that the magnitude of this electoral punishment is contingent on the economic and political context: in instances of rising unemployment, the involvement of external creditors and high protest intensity, the cumulative impact of austerity on government popularity becomes considerable.

AB There is abundant anecdotal evidence that nondemocratic regimes are harnessing new digital technologies known as social media bots to facilitate policy goals. However, few previous attempts have been made to systematically analyze the use of bots that are aimed at a domestic audience in autocratic regimes. We develop two alternative theoretical frameworks for predicting the use of pro-regime bots: one which focuses on bot deployment in response to offline protest and the other in response to online protest. We then test the empirical implications of these frameworks with an original collection of Twitter data generated by Russian pro-government bots. We find that the online opposition activities produce stronger reactions from bots than offline protests. Our results provide a lower bound on the effects of bots on the Russian Twittersphere and highlight the importance of bot detection for the study of political communication on social media in nondemocratic regimes.

AB Incumbents have many tools to tip elections in their favor, yet little is known about how they choose between strategies. By comparing various tactics, this article argues that electoral malpractice centered on manipulating institutions offers the greatest effectiveness while shielding incumbents from public anger and criminal prosecution. To demonstrate this, the study focuses on a widespread institutional tactic: preventing candidates from accessing the ballot. First, in survey experiments, Russian voters respond less negatively to institutional manipulations, such as rejecting candidates, than to blatant fraud, such as ballot box stuffing. Next, using evidence from 25,935 Russian mayoral races, the article shows that lower societal and implementation costs enable incumbents to strategically reject candidacies from credible challengers and then reduce their electoral vulnerability. In all, the technology behind specific manipulations helps determine when and how incumbents violate electoral integrity.

AB Introduction Although similar in many aspects of manufacturing and regulatory provisions to medicines, medical devices have their provisions and attract considerable investments in manufacturing and innovation. While the U.S. holds the leading global position in the devices market, Asia Pacific (APAC) countries like China, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea have proved tremendous market potential holding top ten positions. Still, many APAC countries are import-reliant due to hurdles in technological innovation and regulatory provisions. Areas covered The review aimed to explore those predictors or hurdles and analyzed these to enhance the region's export capacity gradually. Expert opinion Policymakers in APAC countries with no device manufacturing and health technology assessment capacities would be benefited from the review. The findings showed the presence of a gap in manufacturing, innovation, and marketing of devices within the APAC region and between APAC and western countries. Stringent regulatory measures and quality indicators are still lacking in many APAC nations, and there is an urgent need to harmonize regulatory standards. Being a region constituting over one-third of the global population, a considerable investment in innovation, manufacturing, and establishing quality standards is urgently needed among APAC countries to ensure an adequate supply of quality medical devices.

AB Recent studies of Putin-era elites have focused primarily on the role of siloviki. We bring the focus back to an analysis of the elite continuity within the Soviet regime. By compiling a dataset of the Putin-regime elites, we track their professional and family backgrounds to discover that the proportion of Putin-regime elites with Soviet nomenklatura origin (which comprised only 1-3% of the population during the Soviet period) constitutes approximately 60% of contemporary elites. Most have ties in the middle and lower, rather than the top, ranks of the nomenklatura. In addition, the share of those with nomenklatura backgrounds in Putin-era elites is significantly higher than the share of siloviki. These results reflect a noticeable continuity between the Soviet-era and Putin-regime elites 30 years after the transition. This often-ignored characteristic helps understand the absence of an elite split and a high degree of elite compliance with re-autocratization in Putin's Russia.

AB This article follows the transformations of the official narrative about Russia's post-Soviet transition over 20 years of Putin's stay in power. To detect how the gradual evolution of political regime toward authoritarianism was legitimized, it focuses on comparison of concise narratives articulated in the Presidential Addresses to the Federal Assembly between 2000 and 2020. The method of research is computer-assisted qualitative content analysis. The article reveals how the declared stages of modern Russia's development correlated with the evolving representations of the West. The initial goals of establishing democracy, the market economy, and the rule of law over time were either reinterpreted or dissolved into minor practical tasks. The most often articulated policy goal was raising the people's living standards, which was narrated as overcoming the trauma of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the hard 1990s. In the Addresses, Russia became represented as a country that completed its transition between 2012 and 2018, with restoring its international positions and military strength, as well as resources for better social welfare. The "democratic society" was declared to be instituted; however, this term was associated with formal elections and facilitating civic participation, not with the alternation and accountability of power.

AB The role of sustainable development in the export intensity of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) represents an open research question. We consider sustainable development through the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) dimensions as well as via firms' innovative activity indicators. Our objective is to reveal the sustainability determinants of export intensity of SMEs in emerging markets subject to financial constraints, which is one of the major obstacles for SMEs. Our sample is based on the 2018-2020 Business Environment Enterprise Performance Survey data. The Heckman model allows us to reveal the factors relevant for SMEs to gain access to foreign markets under the control of financial constraints specific for SMEs. We also analyze the determinants of the SMEs' share of direct exports in revenue. Our results demonstrate that innovative activity and corporate social responsibility facilitate entry to foreign markets, while equity concentration is a major deterrent. In particular, we reveal a significant positive effect of research and development investment on export intensity. Our findings highlight the complex nature of the interrelations between the SMEs' share of direct exports in revenue and ESG consciousness. We find that other significant factors are political links of the top management, the gender composition of production and administrative units, employee training facilities, and ownership structure.

The analysis of environmental agenda and politics of other regional international organisations (IOs) remained in the shadows compared to studies of European actors. This special issue aims to address the following questions: How do various regional IOs matter in promoting and sustaining an environmental agenda? What challenges do they face? The first perspective developed in this Forward to special issue looks into European IOs comparatively to Eurasian IOs. The second perspective unfolds various environmental issues within the EU and across post-Communist EU members and candidate states. The analysis of these two perspectives discloses multiple dimensions in the nexus of political and economic developments, and contribute to better understanding of the role of IOs in sustainable development.

AB Although repression against elites is a common occurrence in authoritarian regimes, we know little about which elites are targeted. This paper uses an original dataset on the prosecution of mayors in large Russian cities to examine the factors that make elites more likely to be arrested. We argue that in electoral authoritarian regimes like Russia, regime leaders are reluctant to arrest popular officials. Such officials command political capital that is useful to the regime, and arrests of prominent officials can produce popular backlash. We examine this argument using an original dataset on all arrests of municipal leaders in Russia's 221 largest cities between 2002 and 2018. We find that mayors who won their elections by large margins are less likely to be arrested. In addition, we document several other substantively important patterns: (1) a mayor's professional background is not related to the likelihood of arrest, (2) opposition mayors are four times more likely to be arrested, and (3) mobilization of votes for the regime is not protective against arrest.

AB Heterodox economics emerged because of dissatisfaction with the high level of abstraction of neoclassical economics and its excessive reliance on mathematical modelling. Instead of ontological and epistemological references to the natural sciences, heterodox economists turn their attention to the social sciences and biology. The article aims to contribute to the discussion of methodology of heterodox economics and original institutionalism in particular. It explores the potential of content analysis for empirically oriented research in heterodox economics. Content analysis is widely used in the social sciences (sociology, linguistics, political sciences, legal studies) to analyze qualitative data (texts, images, videos) but is relatively unknown to heterodox economists. Content analysis takes several forms: qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods. It is argued that content analysis is not only compatible with the methodology of heterodox economics through critical realism but has a potential to contribute to its further development. With the help of content analysis, heterodox economists would be better equipped to collect and process qualitative data that prevail in social realms. A content analysis of a sample of articles published in Journal of Economic Issues (N = 763) in 1967-1969 and 2010-2019 informs the discussion of applications of content analysis to heterodox economics.

AB Since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis many have opinionated on how it may affect society's response to climate change. Two key questions here are how COVID-19 is expected to influence climate action by citizens and by the government. We answer these by applying topic modelling to textual responses from a survey of Spanish citizens. The identified topics tend to be more negative than positive, and more optimistic concerning future climate action by citizens. Positive views involve increasing pro-environmental behavior and are more common among younger, higher educated and male respondents as well as among those who perceive climate change as a serious threat or positively assessed COVID-19 confinement. Negative topics express concern that financial resources for climate action will be limited due to a focus on healthcare and economic recovery. In addition, they mention government mismanagement and waste due to use of protective measures like masks and gloves as impediments to effective climate action.

AB This article investigates the determinants and consequences of manipulating COVID-19 statistics in an authoritarian federation using the Russian case. It abandons the interpretation of the authoritarian regime as a unitary actor and acknowledges the need to account for a complex interaction of various bureaucratic and political players to understand the spread and the logic of manipulation. Our estimation strategy takes advantage of a natural experiment where the onset of the pandemic adjourned the national referendum enabling new presidential terms for Putin. To implement the rescheduled referendum, Putin needed sub-national elites to manufacture favourable COVID-19 statistics to convince the public that the pandemic was under control. While virtually all regions engaged in data manipulation, there was a substantial variation in the degree of misreporting. A third of this variation can be explained by an asynchronous schedule of regional governors' elections, winning which depends almost exclusively on support from the federal authorities.

ID GENDER; IDENTITY; STIGMA; IMPACT
AB This article analyses the processes of politicisation of some identities, religious affiliations and individual choices within the context of a right-wing backlash to increased recognition of the value and legitimacy of diversity in Europe. The rise of right-wing politics and increasing visibility of anti-immigrant and anti-LGBT movements have demonstrated the strong presence of traditional and patriarchal values and subjected some identities, religious affiliations or individual choices to processes of politicisation. One consequence of the problematisation and politicisation of such personal matters as gender, sexuality and religion is the further stigmatisation and marginalisation of already vulnerable groups. In this article, we consider the experience of young feminists, women of the Muslim community and LGBTIQ activists drawing on a meta-ethnographic synthesis of five cases of young people's activism from Portugal, Germany, Croatia and Russia. Analysis focuses on the question of visibility among these groups of stigmatised young people. We show that while, for some, visibility is a matter of necessity for political engagement, for others, it can entrench stigmatisation and discrimination. We also consider the role of families and communities of belonging, which, in some cases, encouraged but, in other cases, responded negatively towards the young people's engagement.

AB The article explores the challenges encountered during the formation of the Baltic macro-region comprising Russia and eight EU countries (Germany, Poland, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) in the context of the ongoing geopolitical and geo-economic changes. The article aims to assess the dynamics, level, structure and pace of economic development of three Russian regions located on the Baltic Sea (St. Petersburg, Leningrad and Kaliningrad regions) and analyse the intensity of their trade relations with countries of the macro-region. Russian Baltic regions have higher development rates compared to the national average. However, they experience difficulties in their economic development resulting from negative external factors. The article describes possible ways of overcoming these difficulties by improving the sectoral structure of the economy and diversifying international ties. In this context, the development of inter-regional cooperation and the formation of a spatially distributed territorial socio-economic system, including the three Russian Baltic regions, will be particularly beneficial. The period covered by the article is 1996-2021, with a special focus on 2014-2021. The study is based on the economic and statistical analysis of official data of Rosstat and the Federal Customs Service on the sectoral structure and dynamics of the gross regional product (GRP), volume and changes in foreign trade, and its commodity and geographical structure.

AB In this paper, we report the inverted U-shaped relationship between the regime type (on the autocracy - democracy scale) and the risks of revolutionary destabilization. Autocracies tend to be more vulnerable to revolutionary destabilization than full autocracies or consolidated democracies. We would also point at a strong positive correlation between the weakening of autocracies and the risks of revolutionary destabilization that exists among full autocracies. We also observe a certain asymmetry of the U-shaped relationship with full autocracies being far more vulnerable to revolutionary destabilization than full democracies, and with partial autocracies being far more vulnerable to revolutionary destabilization than partial democracies (with factional democracies being the most exposed type of partial democracies). We hence answer the question posed in the late twentieth century if the era of revolution ends with the spread of democracies. The analysis suggests that this will not happen in the foreseeable future. On the one hand, our analysis confirms that consolidated democracy is the most efficient mechanism preventing the emergence of any serious attempts to overthrow power via revolutionary means. However, on the other hand, less than a third of contemporary democracies are consolidated, whereas most of the twenty-first century democracies are partial (a third of which, in turn, are factional democracies); and, as our analysis suggests, revolutions are rather probable in partial democracies (and are even more probable in factional ones). In addition, full autocracies that start moving toward democracy and shifting to partial autocratic rule have increased risks of revolutionary destabilization, which explains why the contemporary global spread of democracy was associated with a rise - rather than a decline - of revolutionary activity. Also, as we find, revolutionary events, e. g., revolutionary movements without revolutions and analogues of revolutions, are quite possible in consolidated democracies. Finally, strong forms of revolutionary destabilization are quite possible in cases when consolidated democracy de-consolidates, which also suggests that the era of revolutions is not going to end in the foreseeable future.

AB The Arctic has long been the setting for collaborative scientific discovery, but tensions related to the Cold War and now the worsening conflict in Ukraine have curtailed effective cooperation. At the same time, the intensifying climate emergency that disproportionately threatens the Arctic has been described as a security threat by policymakers in both the U.S. and Russia, leading to calls for more science diplomacy. This paper revisits the history of U.S.-Russia Arctic science diplomacy and examines how previous initiatives can help us to understand what can be achieved, as well as the challenges that have to be addressed. Science diplomacy can produce valuable results and may form a suitable communication channel during times of political tensions. However, it is also clear that science cooperation is more easily realised during periods of cordial relations.

DE indexical; character; context; reference; semantics; pragmatics; Kaplan
AB The paper presents commentaries on three claims put forward in Kozyreva's paper under discussion. (1) Kozyreva claims that Kaplan's semantics defines communicatively relevant contexts for situations. I challenge this claim by showing that concepts like communicative situation and communicatively relevant context are semantically irrelevant. Thus the question "What is the communicatively relevant context in a given situation?" lies beyond the scope of Kaplan's semantics. (2) According to Kozyreva, Kaplan's semantics should be modified because it provides an incorrect answer to the question above. I agree with her in that a modification of Kaplan's semantics is needed, but I suggest this need is caused by another reason, namely by the fact that Kaplan's concept of context is too narrow to reflect all contexts involved in everyday communication. In Kaplan, the set {a, t, l, w} (a is an agent, t is a time, l is a location, and w is a possible world) is a context only if a is in l at t in w. Predelli suggests dropping this restriction so that any set containing an agent, a time, a location, and a possible world should be considered a context. In my view, this solution allows us to accommodate contexts involved in answering machine scenario and other situations examined by Kozyreva. (3) Finally, in the light of the received distinction between semantics and pragmatics, the concept of a communicatively relevant context belongs to pragmatics. Kozyreva disagrees: she claims that the received distinction should be revised. In my view, this claim (as well as Romdenh-Romluc's claim cited by Kozyreva) is erroneous because it is based on a confusion of two questions: "How do we understand sentences?" and "How do we understand utterances of sentences?".

AB How do nonprofit organizations (NPOs) engage in advocacy in dosed political regimes? This article studies nonprofit advocacy in Russia by focusing on strategies and explanatory factors. We argue that Russian NPOs rely on collaborative rather than confrontational strategies. They use official channels, person& contact with state officials, strategies for resource exchange and evidence-based advocacy. Based on empirical research in eight regions, we show that nonprofit advocacy depends on both external (contextual) and internal (organizational) factors. NPOs have greater opportunity to engage in advocacy when the subnational institutional context and the policy field allow for their active participation in policy formation and implementation. Moreover, NPOs are more successful in their advocacy when they strategically use their capabilities (e.g., knowledge, expertise and skills) and emphasize mutual trust, loyalty and readiness to compromise. Our findings point to the relevance of collaborative forms of advocacy, particularly in constrained political environments such as Russia.

ID GENERAL-THEORY
AB The first part of this paper demonstrates that a group of seven European countries is significantly ahead of other Western states, including the United States, in the development of economic and political institutions. The Seven are Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. They rank first in the life satisfaction index (happiness index) and are leaders in the integral index of quality of life, civic culture, and institutional effectiveness which is formed by aggregating ten most important indicators. These include healthy life expectancy at birth, the corruption perception index, the democracy index, the human development index, the Gini index and a number of others. When this index is used to cluster the set of developed countries, the Seven appears to be the leading cluster. This result suggests that the achievement of high values of the proposed index contributes to the country's advancement to the leading positions in life satisfaction. An analysis of the dynamics of institutional indicators showed that the U.S. lagging behind the Seven has been increasing over time. In recent years, the U.S. has been among the flawed democracies, the levels of generalized trust of U.S. citizens as well as trust in political institutions and in the government are decreasing, the U.S. advantages in terms of global competitiveness and per capita GDP are diminishing. The second part of the paper will consider what qualitative features of socio-economic and political mechanisms provide leadership, and how our findings can be used to develop catch-up strategies.

ID NATIONAL IDENTITY; STATUARY; HISTORY; GHOSTS
AB Landscape semiotics can be explored by focusing on Vladimir Lenin, whose likeness once graced more than 14,000 toponyms, museums, statues and monuments. During the Soviet period, Lenin monuments reflected a symbolic language linking communist power and ideology to particular sculptural characteristics. After 1991, the significance of Lenin statues took multiple paths of evolution in what Lotman would call "explosion." Depending on the geographical and political context, Lenin's statues took on different sorts of "afterlife." They were variously: (a) preserved and left in place to symbolize the legitimacy of post-Soviet elites, (b) taken for granted but permitted to deteriorate, (c) removed, relocated or destroyed to indicate the end of Soviet occupation, and (d) captured and reworked for use in place promotion and capitalist marketing. These various semiotic trajectories demonstrate a Lotmanian "explosion," evident in the post-Soviet landscapes of Russia, the former Soviet Republics, and the West.

AB Previous studies have found a positive relationship between the youth and the educated with protest number, but the form that these protests take needs further research. We argue that students are a unique group, acting neither as an educated nor a young population, and three possible mechanisms push students toward non-violent rather than violent forms of protest. By promoting values of tolerance, higher levels of human capital, and social mobility, education serves as a factor that pacifies destructive tendencies in protest movements. At the same time, universities are a platform for cooperation, and the large amounts of free time and energy make the costs of participating in protests for students minimal compared with other groups. Using a negative binomial regression and a rare events logistic regression, we find that the proportion of students is a strong and consistently significant predictor of the number of nonviolent demonstrations. However, the share of students in the total population does not turn out to be significantly associated with violent protests/armed uprisings.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; POLICY; VULNERABILITY; SCIENCE; DISCOURSE;
   POLITICS
AB Russian science has long warned of adverse climate impacts (also noting some positive effects), but state policies have been lacking. By analysing key policy documents over the last 15 years, this study identifies and explains the development of an adaptation policy. Most recently, a bureaucratic process set in motion by Russia's ratification of the Paris Agreement produced a set of policy documents addressing adaptation to negative climate impacts. These documents employed a bureaucratic-administrative approach, and the effectiveness of expected measures can be questioned. From 2020, a deeper reassessment of climate challenges has evolved, triggered by radical climate changes observed in the Russian Arctic, but also by developments in international climate policies and the energy transition. Economic adaptation to these trends has come to the forefront, raising questions of the need for structural change in the Russian economy. Opposition to reform remains strong, but the scope for discussion of possible pathways has widened considerably. Further development of low-carbon policies in Russia are contingent on international cooperation and integration of Russia in the world economy. The isolation of Russia, following the invasion of Ukraine, will make it difficult to influence Russian climate policies. Key policy insights Unlike the West, Russian climate policy has focused on adaptation, rather than mitigation. But policies have been weak, and adaptation not mainstreamed. Detailed recommendations for adaptation to climate change impacts adopted in 2021 signalled higher political attention, but framed adaptation largely as a technical task. Since 2020, a broader climate change and adaptation discourse entered Russian politics where adaptation to international climate policies and the energy transition is at the centre. Debate on Russia's role in the changing energy market had started, but the invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing international isolation of Russia is likely to reduce Russia's capacity and incentives to carry out low-carbon policies. Western countries will have to consider how they can provide climate policy incentives to Russia in the new international situation, as Russia will remain essential for the success of the climate regime. Science diplomacy may become important.

AB This article seeks to provide a better understanding of the dynamics of the nationwide protests that appeared in Russia as a result of the large-scale political campaigns of 2017-18. On the basis of an original database devoted to six protests, organized in this period by different anti-systemic opposition leaders and organizations, the study explores the turnout and geographic scope of these events and the repertoire of frames that were used to mobilize the protesters. The analysis contrasts three types of frames (an anti-corruption protest frame, election campaign event frame, and anti-systemic protest frame) and demonstrates that appropriate framing was a necessary condition of successful protest mobilization. In combination with other factors, such as the quality of protest organization and the impact of repressive actions of the authorities, the changes of protest frames contributed to the protests' turnout dynamics. Alexei Navalny, the most popular anti-systemic leader, succeeded in organizing the initial mobilization by framing it as an anti-corruption protest, but then, under increasing repression, the opposition failed to convert this dissent into a longer-term campaign with broader electoral or anti-systemic frames.

AB Arctic science diplomacy (ASD) is both a relatively new topic and an acute issue in Russian academic and political circles. There is neither a clear definition of the concept nor a consensus on the stakeholders, tools, and activities of science diplo-macy. This article focuses on the main approaches in Russia in relation to the concept of ASD. The first approach considers ASD as a soft power tool of regional players. Science diplomacy helps to promote a positive image of specific states and to gain access to non-state resources that are usually inaccessible to state actors. A technical/instrumentalist approach to ASD involves the use of academic and scientific-technical cooperation between regions, countries, and societies to create reliable international partnerships on a non-ideological basis and to solve generally significant world problems. The third direction considers ASD as a form of new diplomacy, the strategic goal of which is not only to build friendly relations and coopera-tion with all Arctic countries, but also to develop international scientific cooperation and improve the international image of Russia. This analysis makes it possible to explain the strategic motives and driving forces of ASD and to identify the stake-holders and key forms of Russia's ASD. It is established that the majority of the participants of ASD share the idea that international scientific cooperation in order to ensure the sustainable development of the Arctic can become an effective mechanism for solving the most acute problems of the region, as well as for improving the current relations of Western countries with Russia. The authors believe that Russia has largely managed to form the necessary platforms for the imple-mentation of both strategic and tactical goals of its ASD. These platforms include both national platforms (the international forum "The Arctic: The Territory of Dialogue" and "The Arctic: Present and Future") and the active use of international platforms ("Arctic Frontiers," "Polar Circle," and "Arctic Science Summit Week") and organizations such as the Inter -Agency Standing Committee (IASC), the International Arctic Social Sciences Association (IASSA), and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS).

AB The first part of the paper showed that the group of seven European countries leading in the life satisfaction index (happiness index) significantly outperformed other Western nations, including the United States, in the development of economic and political institutions. The Seven includes Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The second part examines what qualitative features of socio-economic and political mechanisms provide leadership. It is noted that attempts to explain this phenomenon by the low size of population and its homogeneity, as well as by the small area of these countries, are inadequate. The notion of collaborative advantages is introduced, understood as relatively more developed mechanisms of collaboration in the economic, social and political spheres. Based on three different classifications of types of capitalism and on an analysis of the history of countries of the Seven we show that they have reached the leading positions due to collaborative advantages. These countries are coordinated market economies, their economic systems are characterized as stakeholder capitalism, and their political systems are consensus democracies. The Seven of European Leaders carry out reforms aimed at improving collaboration mechanisms and, as a consequence, are less affected by the crisis of competitive institutions observed in Western societies. The presented results support the hypothesis that the strengthening of the role of collaboration mechanisms while reducing the importance of competitive mechanisms contributes to higher life satisfaction. The experience of the Seven is used by other developed European countries as well. The question of how our findings can be used in choosing a catching-up strategy is discussed.

   Based on the existing literature, the authors document several mechanisms that nudge educated people to choose unarmed forms of protest. In particular, education makes people more receptive to liberal-democratic values (including recognition and respect for the rights of others), promotes the development of tolerance and a culture of peaceful discussion, as well as increases human capital, which, on the one hand, makes it possible to successfully use non-violent instruments to defend one's interests, and, on the other hand, increases the relative costs of participating in armed uprisings. Hence, the authors put forward a hypothesis, according to which in countries with a higher percentage of the population with formal education, the likelihood of armed revolutionary uprisings will decrease.
   The analysis of 387 revolutionary events that took place in the world from 1950 to 2019 conducted via cross-tabulation, correlation and regression methods, fully confirms the hypothesis: high level of education is indeed a strong and significant predictor of the unarmed nature of revolutionary upheavals. The correlation is especially high between the proportion of revolutionary events and the average number of years of schooling (in the logged form), which approaches the level of functional dependence. Therefore, the factor of education has the maximum influence on the nature of revolutionary uprisings precisely in the early stages of modernization.

AB Is coordinated anti-regime voting by opposition-minded citizens possible in authoritarian settings where the opposition does not coalesce against the regime? If so, what are the factors behind the citizens' (un)willingness to vote strategically for the opposition? This study investigates the 'smart vote' (umnoe golosovanie) strategy of Aleksei Naval'nyi in the 2020 subnational elections in Russia and shows that it boosted non-regime candidates' electoral results countrywide. The article also finds that the willingness of anti-regime voters to behave strategically depends on the candidates' opposition credentials, and that this willingness can be affected by the scope of voter intimidation available to the authorities.

DT Article
DE internet; terrorism; destabilization; political regimes; media
AB The Internet provides a medium for the rapid mobilization of dissatisfied citizens and potentially contributes to various forms of political instability, including terrorism. However, the spread of the Internet may not lead to a higher intensity of terrorist attacks because direct perpetrators rely on close personal offline ties, and the national security agencies derive symmetrical benefits from Internet development as terrorists. In addition, the number of connections proxies a general level of country development, which is associated with less terrorist activity. We analyze the relationship between the number of Internet connections and the intensity of terrorist attacks using time-series cross-sectional data from the Global Terrorism Database from 1970 to 2018. Estimation of negative binomial regression models demonstrates an inverse relationship between Internet proliferation and the number of terrorist attacks, which holds for democracies and is absent for autocracies. Our results suggest that Internet proliferation is not a decisive factor in terrorism activity. Its impact on terrorism depends on the type of political regime and the level of socio-economic development.

AB In recent years, the question of what form a revolutionary uprising will take - armed or unarmed - has been raised more and more often. This is because, as shown by a large number of studies, nonviolence can explain why the uprising failed or came to success. So, with the beginning of the 21st century, the number of unarmed and successful revolutions is growing, but it is still not clear why this occurs. Moreover, there are only a few quantitative cross-national papers on this topic, in which the authors tried to explain the apparent pattern. However, none of them considered political factors separately. In this paper, the hypothesis is that the country's democracy and the inclusiveness of governance institutions are the determining factors for answering the question: will the revolution be bloody or peaceful? At the same time, it is expected that, on the one hand, the more democratic the country is, and, on the other, the smaller the share of the discriminated population, the more likely a revolution will be unarmed. However, it is important to understand that different types of uprisings differ significantly from each other. So, by exploiting logistic models, it was found that when analyzing all revolutions together, it is democracy that is the main predictor, while the level of discrimination is not so strong. However, if we consider only the national liberation (separatist) revolutions, it turns out that democracy does not play any role in determining the tactics of the protesters, while ethnic discrimination appears to be a very significant factor. On the contrary, within socioeconomic revolutions (non-separatist) discrimination is not significant, while the level of democracy has a direct and strong influence on the degree of violence. Thus, all our hypotheses have been supported: despite the apparent similarity, the level of a country's democracy and the degree of discrimination turn out to be qualitatively independent predictors when answering the question - will the revolution be armed or not?

AB During the last three years, the prospects of engaging China in the process of nuclear disarmament has moved to the forefront of the arms control agenda. In 2019-2020, it was made the top issue by the Donald Trump's administration when it withdrew from the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles (INF Treaty) and refused to prolong the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (the New START). As for Beijing, it flatly rejected US demands to join arms control and this position was endorsed by Moscow. Thanks to the Joseph Biden's administration coming to power in January 2021, the New START was extended by five years in February of the same year. In June, the summit of the presidents of Russia and the United States was held in Geneva, and in July, the official dialogue on strategic stability was launched. However, during the same summer, an unexpected event happened. Independent U. S. experts published information from commercial satellites, which revealed an ongoing construction of three large military bases in central areas of China with hundreds of new silo launchers for intercontinental missiles. Afterwards, the Pentagon confirmed this information and predicted that Chinese missiles buildup may reach the level of about 1000 or more nuclear warheads by the year 2030. This news was neither confirmed nor denied by the official Beijing. However, together with continuing Chinese deployment of strategic ballistic missile nuclear submarines, forthcoming introduction of heavy bombers, expanding early warning satellites and tests of antisatellite systems - these developments imply the fundamental shift in the global and regional strategic balances with profound political consequences. American response to China's strategic buildup and Russian reaction to the U.S. military innovations may entail a next massive cycle of arms race and would cause a new stagnation at the negotiations of the two nuclear superpowers - all highly detrimental to international security. Nonetheless, there is still a chance of reinvigorated diplomatic effort at the U.S. - Russian and U.S. - Chinese tracks, which might lay the foundation of the future multilateral framework of strategic stability.

AB Both urbanization and a high share of youth ("youth bulge") have been shown to correlate with higher levels of political violence, in general, and terrorism, in particular. In this article, we test the hypothesis that urbanization and general youth bulge (share of aged 15-29 in the adult population) should produce a particularly significant impact on the level of terrorist activity when acting together due to the interaction effect. Performed negative binomial regressions (both with and without interaction term) support this hypothesis. We also test the impact of "urban youth bulge" (share of urban youth in the total adult population), and it turns out to be a much more significant predictor of terrorism than either general youth bulge or urbanization taken separately. This finding is shown to have substantial practical implications, indicating that urban youth bulges are likely to retain their relevance in the forthcoming decades, in contrast to general youth bulges.

AB This article is devoted to the formation, current position, and development prospects of the overseas Vietnamese community in Russia. The purpose of the study was to critically review the directions of work of the authorities in the interests of the Diaspora and in order to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries in the socio-economic, cultural, scientific, technical and political spheres. The authors relied on empirical data, including official statistics on migration from Vietnam to Russia, the main indicators of the socio-economic situation in Vietnam as the major factor of emigration, as well as research publications on the history of the Vietnamese communities' formation in Russia. As the result of its analysis, we identified the main areas of cooperation between Vietnam and Russia where the Vietnamese diaspora makes a significant contribution. Accordingly, the paper proposes evidence-based policy recommendations for the government and authorities of Vietnam, which outlined several areas of work with the diaspora in Russia, namely: promoting intercultural dialogue, providing information support and legal assistance for legal migration, developing cooperation in the economy, trade, and labor, as well as joint scientific research and technology transfer.

AB In the USA, governors became central figures in the fight against the novel coronavirus. In many cases, state leaders were forced to choose between preserving life and protecting economic livelihood. While prior research has underscored the important role that US governors played in implementing healthcare policies at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we know little about how characteristics of state leaders impacted self-employment. In this paper, we draw from upper echelons theory to examine how governor party and discretion impacted venture creation in the food and restaurant industry. Interestingly, we find no significant relationship between governor party and venture creation. However, we find that when the governor and legislature were unified in their political party - irrespective of party line - there were a higher number of new food and restaurant ventures created. We also found this effect to be strengthened when small business unemployment levels were higher. We explore the implications of these results for how unity of command may be beneficial during times of crisis.
   Plain English Summary During the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, governors played a critical role in creating policy that either helped to preserve life or protect economic livelihood. Our research examines how two particularly important characteristics of governors and the political environment - party affiliation and discretion - impacted new venture creation within the food and restaurant industry, which is an important indicator of economic recovery. Using a publicly available, hand-collected dataset inclusive of all 50 states, we find that the political party of the governor has no effect on venture creation. However, we demonstrate that when the governorship and state legislature were aligned and led by members with the same party affiliation, the state experienced a greater number of new venture creation in the food and restaurant industry than when leaders of these two branches of government were not aligned. We further found that the effect of governor discretion was stronger when small business unemployment levels were higher. Our findings have implications for practice by suggesting that a unity of command government structure can be advantageous for economic outcomes during crises.

AB Based on the experience of previous studies, the authors use machine learning meth-ods at two levels for evaluating predictors of instability. First, they analyze the factors that lead to instability in general; second, they focus on the factors that influence the intensity of instability. Their analysis relies on data on mass protest destabilization. The system for assessing predictors of nonviolent destabilization is modernized and a two-level model is developed for ranking the factors of instability. After that, using Shapley vectors, all predictors within the final model are estimated and quantified. The authors analyze several subsamples: the world as a whole, the World System core and periphery, and the Afrasian instability macrozone. The result shows that the divi-sion of the original database into world-system zones, as well as specifying the Afrasian zone as a separate entity makes sense. The results obtained through machine learning are further cross-validated with more traditional regression models.

AB As cities around the world increasingly seek to brand themselves as comfortable and liveable places, policies aimed at enhancing the quality of the urban environment are becoming more important. Scholars interpret this development as evidence of reinforced urban entrepreneurialism and neoliberalization. The current paper focuses on comfortable city policies in Russia, where political, social and economic transformations were often depicted as the 'Eastern branch' of the global neoliberalization project. It draws on field data from a case study of two cities in the Russian Arctic. By focusing on locations far away from global nodes, where the ideas of a comfortable city originally took shape, we trace and analyse policy mutations and local adjustments of such policies, as well as the related rationalities and policymaking dynamics. Our findings speak to the literature on policy mobility by questioning the focus on cities as entrepreneurial actors and the depiction of comfortable city policies as mere vehicles of neoliberalism. In Russia, what began with the introduction of entrepreneurial, globally circulating comfortable city policies incrementally turned into a top-down political project that cannot be easily explained - neither by neoliberal rationality nor by the legacies of urban planning and development.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE images of the future; sociology of the future; Russian society; Russian
   mentality; development model
AB The subject of the article is the social ideals of Russians and their ideas about the prospects and the ways for the development of the country. Based on the results of All-Russian sociological surveys, including those conducted in 2021-2022, the article analyzes consolidated Russians' demand for future options, clears up the conceptual foundations of such demand and identifies their social subjects. Comparing the results of sociological studies of various years, the authors of the article note stable ideas of the Russian population about the further development of the country. In the first place among the qualities that Russia of the future should possess, most Russians call social justice, overcoming corruption, mitigating social inequalities, transition to an innovative economy, strengthening the country's international positions. At the same time, as shown in the article, in their understanding of national goals and in their requests for the future, Russians rely on collective historical experience, the quintessence of which is the conviction by the majority of citizens that "Russia should live by its own mind", not looking at imported models and patterns, including Western ones. Accordingly, liberal values in their Western understanding attract only a minority of citizens. In this regard, the article raises the question of how differing perceptions of what is due and desirable in regard to Russia's future correlate with basic social differences (gender, age, education, place of residence, etc.). It is shown that the differentiation of Russians' views on this issue is practically not related to standard socio-demographic differences being rooted in their worldview choice. It is shown that, despite growing anxieties caused by the change in the political situation in the world, values and demands of Russians for the future basically fit into the trends traceable in sociological surveys of the past two decades.

AB The article introduces and substantiates an interdisciplinary evolutionary approach to the study of pulsating and expanding spatiotemporal phenomena of social development or evolving localities (mestorazvitia, (sic).) in the study of the Greater Mediterranean. The authors analyze the ways to combine spatial and temporal moments of regional studies that after the Braudelean turn developed in world-system analysis, with Rokkanean conceptual mapping and new regionalism in order to consequentially deploy their own mode of regionalistics vis-a-vis the Greater Mediterranean. The authors advance the principles of fractal self-similarity to study regions as a key variety of terrestrial worlds of the Anthropocene epoch, similar on the one hand to planetary spheres, and on the other hand to minor evolving localities. This methodology allows us to study not only the integral evolution of a pulsating and expanding regional space-time, but also its individual layers and parameters. In particular, the authors present three possible analytical projections of an integral space-time phenomenon: a shaft in time, a snapshot, and a tree of events. The article concludes with a review of the possibilities of using the concept of the Greater Mediterranean and the methodology of the new regionalistics in specific political research projects, including the political self-determination of Crimea, state-building in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and post-war reconstruction in Ukraine.

AB The article is devoted to the problem of interregional differences in the economic area of the Russian Federation. The research covers a long period (from 1990 to 2020), since this period saw significant changes in the economic, institutional and political structure of the country. The assessment of the level of differences of regions is based on the main socio-economic indicators, data on which are formed in the system of state regional statistics. The Theil index was used as the basic method for measuring inequality. This made it possible to assess the dynamics of the spatial localization of economic activity in terms of the main socio-economic indicators, as well as form the groundwork for continuing the research - assessing its intragroup and intergroup components in the sectoral aspect. For a structural analysis of the problem of regional differences, we propose our own algorithm that allows us to form a discrete variation series and calculate the integral decile coefficient. The numerical implementation of the proposed algorithm made it possible to compile a multidimensional classification of regions according to the level of their economic activity and calculate the decile coefficient on this basis; the decile coefficient integrates the totality of the main socio-economic indicators adopted for the research. The results of the research show the long-term dynamics of the growth of differences and its significant level in comparison with the pre-reform period. A numerical assessment of the measure of differences, measured using the integral decile coefficient for a set of basic economic indicators of the regions, has been compiled. On this basis, it was found that in the long term (1995-2020) the level of economic differences of the regions increased from 2.4 to 5.6 times. A classification of regions according to the level of economic activity has been compiled, which reflects the nature of the differences of the regions of the Russian Federation, as well as the geography of the location of centers of concentration of economic activity.

DT Article
DE post-normal science; politicization of science; experts; objectivity
AB The author starts from the contemporary image of "post-normal sci-ence", which implies the openness of science to policy (S. Funtovicz and J. Ravetz). She considers the idea of post-normal science as a normative basis for the scientists' demand for the politicization of science, as a conceptual condition for grasping crises and the role of scientific expertise in their resolution, and as a designation of a spe-cial phenomenon of contemporary science with the ambiguous sta-tus of a scientist-expert. Based on the analysis of the concept, the author emphasizes the problem of combining scientific validity and political relevance, inherent in post-normal science. The ele-ments of this problem are the danger of including science in politics, the violation of objectivity and the lack of demarcating scientific and non-scientific knowledge. The author argues that the solution of the problem becomes possible if the political relevance of science is in-terpreted as interaction, and scientific validity as objectivity are re-vealed through attention to the concept of "knowing-how".

ID SYSTEM
AB The formal indivisibility of security, which theorists in the field of international relations speak of, is an indisputable thing. Although the development of military technology, the format of globalization, a critical attitude towards classical geopolitics have led to an underestimation of the spatial factor, regionalisation has once again proved that it is an integral part of globalisation and its alter ego. At the beginning of the third decade of the 21st century, political developments in Europe are closely connected with military security. Although this interdependence is not new, the regional security system has been relatively stable for quite some time. The steadily, albeit gradually aggravating situation around the Kaliningrad region and the Republic of Belarus has caused a response - coordinated cooperation in the framework of the Union State. The consequence of which was the formation of a sub-regional security complex (SRSC), which includes the Republic of Belarus and Russia's Kaliningrad region. And a theoretical justification for the formation of this complex is the focus of this article. The authors determine the floating boundaries of the SRSC, where spatial effects of military-political ties take on a special character. This study aims to apply and adapt the concept of regional security complexes to the military-political space of the eastern part of the Baltic Sea. The practical implications of this research include substantiating the interconnectedness and interdependence of security doctrines and practices in a troubled region of Europe.

TI The polymorphism and tradition of funerary practices of medieval Turks
   in light of new findings from Tuva Republic
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID SHOROON BUMBAGAR; TOMB
AB The medieval Turks of the eastern Asian steppe are known for funerary finds exalting horsemanship and military heroism that thrived on intertribal warfare. Existing bodies of research on various categories of objects-which include architecture, stelae, grave goods and inhumations-are in depth but highly regionalized. As a result, our understanding of the archaeological culture of the Turks on a spatio-temporal scale commensurate with territorial shifts in their political dominion throughout the period of the Turk khaganates (mid-6th to mid-8th centuries CE) remains disjunct. The present paper addresses this problem of disparate data. We present a synthesis of the archaeological research of medieval Turks spanning Mongolia, southern Siberia, and Xinjiang in view of results of the excavation of medieval burials at Tunnug 1 in Tuva Republic-where Turkic remains are dispersed and not easily distinguishable from other funerary cultures of connecting time periods. We argue that Turkic funerary culture can be better characterized as polymorphic-the presence of different regional amalgams of burial traditions. The horse-and-human burials and commemorative ogradka known to be quintessentially Turkic are but one of the more dominant amalgams. This pattern of differential practices is congruent with the history of medieval Turks evolving as peoples of mixed lineages and political groupings, rather than people of a unitary culture.

AB The article analyses the gaps and ties betweenthe doctrine and theory, in contrast with the practice, of countering subversive movements in the British Empire during the Interbellum. Contradictions between security services led to the articulation and promotion of different models of counterinsurgency. The research contains an analysis of the guerrilla warfare concept' evolution within the military thought, through the second Boer war, Irish warof Independence and the second Arab rising in Palestine, reflecting different thoughts on interrelated problems of the 'revolutionary movements' and `sub-war after the Great War. Particular attentionis paid to military and political incentives and constrains of the counterinsurgency doctrine, reflecting the bureaucratic logic that stood behind the implementation of the guerrilla warfare concept at the levels of doctrine and theory in the context of the systemic crisis of empire and the growth of external pressure over the questions of the imperial defense and self-determination. Conflicting coexistence of internal security models tested within the British Empire during the Interbellum is observed in the conclusion, as well as perspectives of transfers of colonial (dis)order in front of the 'sub-war', as it was understood among the military circles through the prism of the guerrilla warfare concept.

AB The political project on bioeconomy strives to address multiple societal aspirations, namely combine economic growth with environmental sustainability in some socially acceptable manner. The contradictions between the goals and the concrete plans to increase production, processing, and consumption of forest biomass in Europe have however raised sustainability concerns within and beyond its borders. While political actors articulate such contradictions differently and compete for traction for their viewpoints in the public discourse, little is known about how citizens of urban areas perceive this discourse. Conceptualising perception as a multidimensional construct, data from eight European university cities (Bordeaux, Bratislava, Freiburg, Helsinki, Padua, St. Petersburg, Uppsala, Vienna) are statistically analysed to explore its dimensions, the communities of like-minded citizens forming across those dimensions, and the traits associating with membership in each such community. Five communities across six dimensions from biocentrism through distributional aspects to adherence to political goals are identified: adherent-environmentalist, adherent-governmentalist, critical-reformist, critical -agriculturalist, and indifferent. City of residence and perceived familiarity with bioeconomy clearly interact with perception. There is however considerable variation in communities within and across the eight cities, suggesting deeper social tension beyond the public discourse. Much of the within-community variation remains unexplained, though, calling for more work locally. Implications for forest policy are derived.

DE geopolitical turbulence; world capital accumulation center; competition;
   war; world economic system
AB The paper investigates a set of factors contributing to Russia's transformation into a new world capital accumulation center in the next two to three decades. The novelty of our approach lies in the fact that we consider the current phase of global geopolitical turbulence through the prism of the capital accumulation cycles theory in order to determine the vector of future development of the world economic system. We dig into the topic by forming a comprehensive picture of Russia's potential advantages that are quite versatile. Thus, we look into the following phenomena: geographical (ice decline in the Russian Arctic; Russia evolving from a land power into a sea power; natural resources endowment), philosophical (dialectical confrontation of homogeneity and heterogeneity of the world system), historical (syndrome of false contender for the role of a world capital accumulation center; passionarity of the ethnos), political (parade of sovereignties and imperial revanchists, diffusion of the nuclear syndrome, legitimization of the struggle against political and managerial opposition), political economy (cycles of capital accumulation; world capital accumulation center; Russia's economy joining the world system of capitalism), economic (effectiveness of international economic sanctions; general-purpose technologies; industry cycles; regulatory and technology triads), demographic (demographic curse), cultural (openness of the Russian Civilization to immigrants, its civilizing experience in relation to other peoples, high civilizational absorption), military (latent and active phases of hybrid warfare; hybrid warfare paradox), factors and management effects (autonomous and authoritarian management, hegemon and leader models). This helped us to reconstruct the system of checks and balances formed around the Russian Federation in the hybrid warfare between the West and the Non-West. We deepen the analysis by providing our own interpretation of sea states and land states. The main conclusion of the research is that Russia possesses unique geopolitical advantages that allow it to successfully counteract the Collective West and eventually become a new leader of the world economic system.

AB The article examines the situation of Russia falling into the epicenter of geopolitical shifts in 2022, when the country found itself involved in the hybrid warfare with the Collective West. The novelty of our approach consists in reconstructing key events of the geopolitical competition of the last 15-20 years with the use of an extensive range of related concepts from various fields: economics (Trout's mistake, neocolonialism), cybernetics (Ashby's Law and Sedov's Law), management (external management, hybrid warfare), synergetics (synergetic effect, system complexity), political science (security, freedom, power structure), political economy (Arrighi's cycles of capital accumulation, global capital center, rate of return), institutionalism (shifting risks from the physical world to the social world), geography (horizontal diffusion of innovations), psychology (war of meanings, war of nerves). This made it possible to bring together many poorly compatible phenomena of different nature, synthesize the concepts used and reveal the logic behind the struggle of geopolitical players for world hegemony. To deepen the analysis, we provide our own typology of world wars and their characteristics. We prove that the special military operation in Ukraine exposed the impasse of Russia's economic policy and consolidated other countries in a hybrid war against the United States, thereby becoming a key event in history and giving rise to a global geopolitical confrontation between the West and the Non-West. Our main conclusion is that Russia has objectively found itself in the epicenter of geopolitical turbulence, and, consequently, cannot avoid a direct collision with the Collective West; therefore, over the next 15-20 years the country will have to go through all the stages of a new hybrid world war.

TI CANCEL CULTURE IN WORLD POLITICS: HISTORICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE cancel culture; new ethics; post-truth; Popper; Soros; universal values
AB In the West, 'cancel culture,' which is spreading at the speed of an epidemic, has been turned into a mechanism for applying a 'new ethics.' Despite the fact that the concept of 'cancel culture' remains opportunistic, it has become necessary to identify the subject of research of this phenomenon from the standpoint of political science and methods of historical and philosophical deconstruction in order to understand: what is the genesis and true meaning of the cancel culture and why it has so widely and promptly acquired such an influence on world politics? The hypothesis is that cancel culture is connected by a sociogenetic code with the evolution (moreover, mutation) of the deep meanings of European culture, dating back to the sacralization of antique rituals, Aristotelian 'tertium non datur' principle, the ideology of the Crusades, to the 'contractual truth' of Karl Popper's positivist 'contractual truth' that gave rise to Soros-type 'open society' cultural universalism. New media, and social networking par excellence, have become instruments of pressure through a cancel culture at the international level. The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the depth of the crisis of the Open society social project and globalization, understood as leveling the values of national cultures, including political ones, in congruency with the standards of the American worldview. The measures taken by Russia, China, and a number of other countries to protect their axiological sovereignty led to a tough reaction from the West in the form of 'fencing off' and a scheme of 'punishment' similar to the 'canceling of Hollywood movie stars,' that is, treating the 'dissident' countries as rogue states, interfering with the 'effective' project of 'democratic globalization up to the declaration of 'dissident countries' as rogue states interfering with the 'effective' project of 'democratic globalization'. In this discussion article, the author considers ways to neutralize attempts to 'cancel Russian culture' and proves that Russia has a 'firewall' in the form of traditional values opposing the 'new ethics' as well as in the form of creating new ties and open platforms for interaction at the international level. At the same time, it is in Russia's interests to avoid self-isolation from the West and build relations with it, combining the protection of value sovereignty and the media environment with balanced strategic empathy in order to avoid a catastrophic escalation of events towards nuclear war threshold.

TI SOCIO-POLITICAL DYNAMICS IN THE AGE OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS: CIVILIZATIONAL
   BACKGROUND
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE civilization; civilizational discourse; universal civilization;
   universalism; particularism; world order; development
AB The article analyzes the processes of actualization of civilizational discourse in modern political science, facing today the challenge of comprehending political development that generates a global crisis. The perception of this discourse today contrasts markedly with the essentially negative attitude of most of the political science community with the still recently. This attitude was, in fact, a desire for a kind of "cancelling" of such discourse, an interpretation of involvement in it as not meeting the criteria of modern approaches to the analysis of politics and therefore reprehensible. Nevertheless, civilizational issues throughout the 20th century attracted the attention of political philosophers and the most insightful political researchers who are trying to advance in the development of ideas about the fundamental diversity of cultural and civilizational foundations for the development of modern society, as well as the about impact of this diversity on the nature of the current crisis of the world order and its likely consequences. One of the most important problem nodes of the study is the contradictory conjugation of concepts that characterize the universalist and particularist approaches to the conceptualization of a civilizational society. The first approach reduces all civilizational issues to the recognition of the legitimacy of talking about just the only a universal civilization or one that can serve for the world as the only worthy model, an ideal type of social and cultural arrangement. The second approach insists that even within the framework of modern national societies and the territorial states that form them, the persisting cultural and civilizational "otherness" is worthy of the right to continue to exist. Moreover, it often turns out to be an indispensable development resource of these societies. Within the framework of the study, a comparative analysis of the conjugation and latent conflict of these two approaches to the conceptualization of the cultural and civilizational foundations of modern politics is carried out. From a civilizational perspective, the evolutionary limits of universalism and the prospects for the transformation of the world order are discussed.

   Sovereignism to Patriotism

DT Article
DE Italy; right-wing populism; discourse; Brothers of Italy; the League;
   Forward Italy; elections
AB The transformation of the discourse of right-wing populist parties in Italy from 2018 to 2022 is considered. Based on analysis of the discourse of the programs and electoral rhetoric of the parties the Brothers of Italy, the League, and Forward Italy, the author concludes that Italian right-wing populism is becoming more moderate, replacing the concepts of sovereignism with "patriotism and conservatism " and rejecting Euroscepticism. Although nationalism is still characteristic of the right-wing parties in Italy, it is changing: a legalist approach to migrants is gradually replacing the ethnocultural and socioeconomic approaches. Populism remains the basic strategy of the right-wing parties, but the role of the main "enemy " of the Italian people is shifting from the European bureaucracy to the domestic mainstream Center-Left (i.e., the Democratic Party). The authoritarianism of the right-wing populists has undergone the least change in terms of ideological content between 2018 and 2022, but its importance has increased with the growing public demand for political stability and the increasing personalization of politics. This article contributes to the study of the phenomenon of right-wing populism.

AB The increasing tensions within global gas markets, especially in Europe where gas makes up a considerable share of the energy balance, are considered. The nature and reasons behind supply and demand imbalances in the European gas market are analyzed. The risk factors that have caused the unsatisfactory situation in the field of energy, including strong volatility, stock levels, imbalances in supply, and political unpredictability, are examined. The analysis of factors impacting the energy crisis has revealed that the situation is largely dependent on the supranational policy of the EU, which is stimulating a surge in energy demand.

A rapid change in attitudes to China within the US political elite is recorded, which indirectly reflects the influence of think tanks on it. Based on the analysis of reports of leading think tanks, the evolution of their views on China is demonstrated. The main conclusion is that the think tanks support an anti-Chinese consensus, strengthened during the presidency of D. Trump, and advocate stricter measures against China. Overall, the American expert community sticks to the same approaches to China and gives approximately similar recommendations to the US government.

DT Article
ID SOCIAL MEDIA; COMMUNICATION
AB The rise of social media accompanied by the Covid-19 Pandemic has instigated a shift in paradigm in the presidential campaigns in Iran from the real world to social media. Unlike previous presidential elections, there was a decrease in physical events and advertisements for the candidates; in turn, the online presence of presidential candidates is significantly increased. Farsi Twitter played a specific role in this matter, as it became the platform for creating political content. In this study, we found traces of organizational activities in Farsi Twitter, and our investigations reveal that the discussion network of the 2021 election is heterogeneous and highly polarized. However, unlike many other documented election cases in Iran and around the globe, communities of candidates' supporters are very close in one pole, and the other pole is for "Anti-voters" who endorse boycotting the election. With almost no reciprocal ties, these two poles form two echo chambers, one favoring the election and the other for voter suppression. Furthermore, a high presence of bot activity is observed among the most influential users in all of the involved communities.

AB Researchers of Russian elections have long noticed that in a number of ethnic republics, the level of electoral mobilization and voters' political conformism is higher than the average in Russia. Which factors influence a high level of electoral mobilization? How does it work? The article attempts to answer these questions by analyzing qualitative data collected through focus groups in five regions: Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Komi, Chuvashia, and Yakutia. The results of the study allow us to conclude that a high level of electoral mobilization is the result of a combination of three factors, each of which affects different categories of voters.l

AB The article examines the processes of formation and institutionalization of the pan-European political space as an important element of the political system of the European Union. The main theoretical approaches to the study of this problem are presented. The analysis of the Europeanization process and its possible influence on the formation of this space is given. The attitude to this process on the part of the EU political elite, as well as ordinary European citizens, is shown. It is demonstrated that the political institutions of the European Union and the European integration itself influence the political culture, the formation of a common European identity of citizens and their political attitudes. The basic principles and elements of the pan-European political space, including pan-European institutions, political parties, mass media, etc., are described, particularly from the perspective of proponents of various description models, inter alia the models of liberal representation, participatory democracy and deliberative democracy. The main aspects of the evolution of the European Union party and political system, which is an important element of the pan-European political space, are presented. It has been noted that since the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the European parties have significantly increased their role and influence in the pan-European political system. An attempt is made to understand how the elements and models interact with each other, what the positions of specific European parties and their factions in the European Parliament are considering the future EU development. The importance of successful implementation of the "Spitzenkandidaten principle" was specified, which will allow the European party leaders and their election manifestos to become better known and understood not only by politicized voters, but also by a majority of the electorate. The role and influence of the media and cultural sphere on the formation of this space are analyzed.

AB The article examines the interim results of the accomplishments of the Chancellor O. Scholz's government. It states both the succession of the political course and its novelty. The trend towards the consistent development of interaction between Berlin and Paris, on the effectiveness and quality of which the prospects for the European Union largely depend, is confirmed. Paying traditionally great importance to the transatlantic partnership with the United States, Germany, together with France, intends to consolidate the strategic European sovereignty. The struggle against the problems of the pandemic, the climate and their socio-economic consequences for democracy remain key agendas for the ruling coalition with the participation of the SDP, the Greens and the FDP. The problems of O. Scholz's European Eastern policy are analyzed, according to which an important, but hardly a priority place is determined for Russia. With regard to the Ukrainian crisis, the O. Scholz's government is in a difficult situation. Berlin is too deeply immersed in the process of solidarity assistance to Kiev, not "noticing" the growing influence of radical nationalists on the leadership of Ukraine. The American factor is clearly manifested in the European context, which is saturated with pressure on the Germans, and calls for Berlin to observe bloc discipline. The struggle for Nord Stream-2 is acquiring new dimensions, sharpness. Under Chancellor O. Scholz, against the backdrop of a special military operation of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, the dismantling of Russian-German relations is being completed. In Berlin, a fatal decision was made to provide Kiev with German lethal weapons, which for the first time after the World War II kill Russians. This and other factors undermine the historical process of reconciliation between the peoples of Russia and Germany, make it much more difficult to predict the future dialogue between Moscow and Berlin. At the same time, the regular telephone conversations between the German Chancellor and the President of the Russian Federation make it possible to maintain an important channel of communication, "synchronize clocks" on the current agenda, primarily the settlement of the Ukrainian crisis, and the prospects for a European security structure. The situation in Europe and the world remains dangerously complex and unpredictable.

ID POLITICAL RADICALIZATION
AB Far-right extremist communities actively promote their ideological preferences on social media. This provides researchers with opportunities to study these communities online. However, to explore these opportunities one requires a way to identify the far-right extremists' communities in an automated way. Having analyzed the subject area of far-right extremist communities, we identified three groups of factors that influence the effectiveness of the research work. These are a group of theoretical, methodological, and instrumental factors. We developed and implemented a unique algorithm of calendar-correlation analysis (CCA) to search for specific online communities. We based CCA on a hybrid calendar correlation approach identifying potential far-right communities by characteristic changes in group activity around key dates of events that are historically crucial to those communities. The developed software module includes several functions designed to automatically search, process, and analyze social media data. In the current paper we present a process diagram showing CCA's mechanism of operation and its relationship to elements of automated search software. Furthermore, we outline the limiting factors of the developed algorithm. The algorithm was tested on data from the Russian social network VKontakte. Two experimental data sets were formed: 259 far-right communities and the 49 most popular (not far-right) communities. In both cases, we calculated the type II error for two mutually exclusive hypotheses-far-right affiliation and no affiliation. Accordingly, for the first sample, beta = 0.81. For the second sample, beta = 0.02. The presented CCA algorithm was more effective at identifying far-right communities belonging to the alt-right and Nazi ideologies compared to the neo-pagan or manosphere communities. We expect that the CCA algorithm can be effectively used to identify other movements within far-right extremist communities when an appropriate foundation of expert knowledge is provided to the algorithm.

TI China's Strategic Partnership with Russia amid the COVID-19 Pandemic
SO CHINA REVIEW-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL ON GREATER CHINA
LA English
DT Article
AB Beijing and Moscow issued a joint statement declaring that Sino-Russian relations have reached the highest level in their history and exceeded the form of a military and political alliance in late June 2021. This article systematically analyzes the Russian-language materials publicized by the authorities and local media in the first six months of the COVID-19 outbreak and explores if the global public health crisis would mean a fundamental transformation of the strategic partnership between China and Russia. The authors find that the Russian government adopted the strictest anti-pandemic measures vis-a-vis China, compared to the other post-Soviet states. Russia took a highly cautious approach to the border control, mobility of Chinese citizens, and procurement of China-made inactivated vaccines. The domestic front in Russia was also inclined to be defensive on China in the time of the pandemic. The findings offer an important reference for the "new era" of Sino-Russian strategic partnership, a highly pragmatic and flexible agreement driven by the mutual interest in prevailing circumstances. It remains to be observed if there will be a fundamental shift in the postCOVID era.

AB We address issues of description of the origin and evolution of the genetic code from a semiotics standpoint. Developing the concept of codepoiesis introduced by Barbieri, a new idea of semio-poiesis is proposed. Semio-poiesis, a recursive auto-referential processing of semiotic system, becomes a form of organization of the bio-world when and while notions of meaning and aiming are introduced into it. The description of the genetic code as a semiotic system (grammar and vocabulary) allows us to apply the method of internal reconstruction to it: on the basis of heterogeneity and irregularity of the current state, to explicate possible previous states and various ways of forming mechanisms of coding and textualization. The revealed patterns are consistent with hypotheses about the origin and evolution of the genetic code.

   Periphery: An Analysis

AB This article offers an analysis of a mathematical model of the influence of one of the major factors of the World System's macrodynamics throughout most of its history (since the 'urban revolution') - civilizations' interaction with their tribal peripheries (described in our previous article). The proposed mathematical model is intended to describe the possible influence of interaction between the civilizational core of the World System and its tribal periphery on the formation of the specific curve of world urbanization dynamics. It simulates completion of the phase transition, the behavior of the system in the attraction basin, and the beginning of the phase transition to the attraction basin of the new attractor. The aim is to identify the role of interaction between the civilizational core and tribal periphery in the formation of an attractor effect during the completion of phase transition - that is, to clarify not only why there a slowdown in growth rates of the main indicators of World System development observed following completion of phase transitions during its development, but why these rates fell, with a subsequent temporary stabilization near some equilibrium level. Achievements of modern studies of tribal peripheries, including our understanding of complexity of the tribal periphery itself and its het-erogeneity, are considered. The basic principle of the proposed dy-namic model is that the size, power and level of complexity in realization of external policy functions in nomadic / "barbarian' unions (empires) closely correspond to the size, power and level of political culture and activity of the core states with which tribal systems constantly had to interact (a point previously established by experts in nomadic studies). Various alternatives are shown in the model. De-pending on the power and size of one of the two components of the "civilization-tribal periphery' system, the other component also changes significantly as it has to respond to the challenge properly, or can make less efforts without feeling threat or resistance. This principle is observed throughout the long history of the World System. We show that interaction between the civilizational center and tribal periphery can explain some characteristic features of World System dynamics in the 4th millennium BCE - 2nd millennium CE. The patterns of interaction between the periphery and the center of the World System may be useful in understanding current phenomena, such as the migrant crisis of 2015 in Europe.

ID IMMIGRATION
AB The article analyzes the complex interface between the phenomenon of migration and the security of the European Union and its member-states. The migration crisis in Europe, which began with the Arab Spring in 2015 and continues to this day, is truly one of the most important existential challenges for the EU. This crisis is overlapped with other fundamental problems facing the European Union, contributing to the securitization of migration and asylum issues. In the absence of an effective EU strategy in this direction, there remains the danger of radicalization of European societies and, therefore, a threat to the entire integrationist project. The process of globalization has supplemented some of the traditional functions of the state, first of all, such as protection of its territory and political independence, with new functions that are associated with the obligation to ensure economic independence, cultural identity and social stability. Securitization of migration usually has several dimensions: socio-economic problems (unemployment, the growth of the black economy, the crisis of the welfare state and the deterioration of the urban environment); the growth of securitarism in the EU member-states (when migrants are viewed as a threat to the national identity and demographic equilibrium of the host society); and political challenges as a result of the nexus between external and internal security caused by the terrorist threat. In addition to traditional challenges, there emerged a fairly new phenomenon - instrumentalization of the migration problem, namely the use of migrants by the third countries as a means of pressure on the EU member states in order to achieve certain political or economic goals. The new Pact on Migration and Asylum introduces a number of undeniably positive provisions for the European Union. Nevertheless, the document has been criticized by the EU individual countries, as well as by public and human rights organizations. This situation can be explained by the fact that in modern Europe, security interests and values are in a moral conflict with each other, which presents the main challenge to the future of the European project.

DT Article
DE Turkey; Azerbaijan; Transcaucasia; Nagorno-Karabakh; "Turkic world";
   pan-Turkism; cooperation; foreign policy; energy
AB The article scrutinizes Turkish-Azerbatjani key areas of cooperation - political, economic, military-technical, cultural and humanitarian. For instance, in addition to intensive interaction at the level of high-ranking political elites, Azerbaljani-Turkish unity in the political context is largely built on the basis of classifying foreign policy partners into common friends and common enemies (the "friend-foe" principle). Thus, both Ankara and Baku are building friendly relations with the Turkic states of Central Asia. At the same time, Armenia acts as a common "enemy". In the military sphere, both states seek to form Turkey-oriented militarized structures and, moreover, to create a unified Turkic army in the long term. The nature of economic relations between Azerbaijan and Turkey is largely based on a competitive basis. Energy acts as a unifying and at the same time a divisive factor since both states strive for leadership in this area, seeking to occupy a special place in the regional energy market. In the cultural and humanitarian sphere, the unfolding Turkey-centric integration is of particular importance. The author comes to the conclusion that nowadays the bilateral relations between Turkey and Azerbaijan are characterized by the "merging" of the two countries into a single Turkey centric space, which manifests in almost all fields of interaction. The Republic of Turkey seeks to influence Baku in order to make it a reference point of the "Turkic world" under its auspices. This trend is most likely to strengthen in the future.

DT Article
DE geopolitical turbulence; world capital accumulation center; competition;
   war; world economic system
AB The article discusses mechanisms that are put into action during the hybrid war of civiliza - tions that has unfolded at the present time. For this purpose, the concepts of two antagonistic megacivilizations - the West and the Non-West - have been introduced. We reveal the essence and genesis of the First and Second civilizational failures within Western civilization, reconstruct the anatomy of destruction of the national model of Russia's social development after 1991 under the influence of the neocolonial governance system. We uncover and interpret the paradox of the lag in the development of the two megacivilizations, look into the genesis of the passionarity of the ethnos, and substantiate the primacy of geopolitical logic over economic logic. We provide an outlook of the current hybrid war between the West and the Non-West. The novelty of our approach consists in combining the knowledge of different sciences to explain social processes during the period of geopolitical turbulence. We look into philosophical phenomena (opposite dynamics of the material and spiritual spheres), cybernetic (full and partial cybernetic inversions), historical (birth of ethnic passionarity), political (hybrid wars), biological (neuroplasticity of the brain), cultural (cultural plasticity of civilization), economic (world currency, phenomenon of superprofits) factors. This made it possible to correlate objective and subjective factors in the confrontation between the two megacivilizations. The main conclusion of the study is that neither the West (USA) nor the Non-West (Russia) has clear advantages in the unfolding hybrid war of civilizations. The tactical superiority of the West is opposed to the strategic superiority of the Non-West; this situation does not allow us to make unambiguous predictions about the future winner.

AB Several historic international conflicts, considered in the article, have presented a risk of nuclear weapons being used. The authors analyze and systematize factors and methods that allowed the sides to prevent the escalation of such conflicts to the "nuclear threshold" and avoid the risk of catastrophic consequences linked to passing such a "threshold". The opportunity and probability of avoiding a nuclear escalation that is caused by unintended or unsanctioned actions, human and technical mistakes, malfunctions, wrong interpretations of the actions of the potential adversary are discussed. The authors review existing mechanisms of de-escalation of military-political incidents and analyse the complex of confidence-building and security assuring measures. Their validity and applicability in modern conditions are considered through a study of the current tense situation in Russia's relations with the West/NATO, as well as in a long-term (in scale of decades) perspective.

AB Study is devoted to analysis of social and demographic features of generation of the revolutionary turning point, which took an active part in the events of all-Russian revolutionary movement at the beginning of XXth century. The actuality of work is determined by necessity of study image of the left radical part of young peoples borned in 1890s. The biggest part of domestic and foreign researchers studying the similar issues take their attention on representatives of some parties or national groups, while the study of revolutionary movement through the "generational" section is resting poorly explored. According to author`s viewpoint using of generational approach will give possibility possible to deeply penetrate into the studying era, to understand the internal world and reasons of radicalization of moods of revolutionary turning point generation, which is the purpose of this study. The main source for writing the article was the biographical directory of the All-Union Society of Political Prisoners and Exiles, composed from personal profiles. The biographical data of participants in revolutionary movement formed basis for creation database table which gave possibility to analyze their main sociographic features. In order of study motivations for joining revolutionary organizations and reasons for radicalization of moods of young peoples, were studied the memories and autobiographies of political prisoners, preserved in the funds of the State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF). In context of specific aim of study the authors were guided in the same time by historical-comparative, retrospective, and quantitative methods. In result of analysis of the personalized electronic database, the authors made some conclusions. Firstly it was distincted the heterogeneous national composition of the revolutionaries in which largest share was represented by Jews. Secondly it was shown that largest part of studied group joined in revolutionary movement at the age of 15-17 and in this context it wasn`t surprising that the high point of their revolutionary activity felt on years of the first Russian revolution. Thirdly, the analysis of the structure of class origin indicates about predominance of people from the petty-bourgeois class, while the children from peasant families felt under the influence of revolutionary ideas, as a rule, already in the cities. The educative level of young revolutionaries was low, but their radicalism non-rarely served as reason for expulsion from educational institution. Big part of young people was spontaneously involved to revolutionary movement, thus expressing their dissatisfaction by existing regime.

AB The article gives a constructive criticism of a number of provisions put forward by D.A. Davydov regarding the trends in the formation of post-capitalist relations in modern society. The authors emphasize that the study of such relations will be incomplete if it does not include an analysis of the processes taking place in a number of countries that are following a different path than the leading countries with a capitalist economy. Appealing to the practices of the PRC and a number of other countries, the authors pay attention to the development of relations that form the values and motives of collective, solidarity activity for the benefit of society and may be qualified as real germs of socialism. This is typical not only for China, which is building socialism with Chinese characteristics, but also for countries that retain capitalist system, but at the same time are forced to turn to relations that are socialist in content in order to strengthen the economy and reduce social contradictions.

AB The article analyzes the formation of the imperial policy to spread Orthodox Christianity using the example of the construction of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Revel in the Governorate of Estonia. Late 19(th) - early 20(th) century was marked by significant changes in the governance of the region, not only in the administrative and legal sphere, but also in the religious one. Estonia administration viewed strengthening the presence of the Orthodox Church through the mass construction of churches and the symbolic development of space as one of the most effective means of integrating the province and the empire. The construction of the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Reval was associated with significant historical events, including the 200(th) anniversary since Estonia became a part of Russian Empire. It determined its central role in the representation of the empire on the outskirts. At the same time, the prevalence of the Lutheran population in the province, as well as the economic dominance of the German nobility, caused difficulties with the construction process. The search for funds and the choice of a place for the Cathedral were the main reasons why the implementation of such a large-scale project took so long. Cathedral was designed to visually emphasize that the region was a part of the Russian Empire. The analysis of the preparatory work, using unpublished office materials from various departments, made it possible to identify contradictions between central and local authorities on this issue, as well as to understand the mechanisms of their interaction within the framework of existing practices. The materials of personal and official correspondence of key political and religious actors involved show different understanding of the goals and means how to spread Orthodox Christianity in the region at the turn of the 19(th) - 20(th) century.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of modern Russian historiography of criminal and political exile to Siberia. The authors consistently consider the main directions of development of post-Soviet studies, note, first of all, the great interest of historians in various aspects of the penitentiary policy and practice of the empire in Siberia, the features of the imprisonment of political and criminal prisoners. Further, a sharp drop in the attention of specialists to the history of the exile of the Social Democrats, and above all, the Bolsheviks, is stated, and vice versa - a significant increase in works devoted to the stay in exile of representatives of the Socialist Revolutionaries and anarchists. The publications on the history of the exile to Siberia of the Decembrists are analyzed, the content of the discussion about the evolution of their worldview, the role of "noble revolutionaries" in the political history of Russia is conveyed. The authors also briefly analyze the main directions of publications of the Irkutsk collection of scientific articles "Siberian Link", created back in 1973. It is concluded that the history of criminal and political exile to Siberia as a scientific direction in the post-Soviet period continues to develop successfully, acquiring new facets, replenished with specific studies and authors.

AB Denmark upholds high standards of human rights as long as the interests of its citizens are concerned but erects barriers for migrants of a different cultural background who might threaten the security of the national community. The Danish tradition of liberalism, humanism and the welfare state coexists with one of Europe's most restrictive policies towards third-country immigrants. The article traces the evolution of management approaches to developing the immigration policy and integrating foreign cultural migrants in Denmark. It describes the value determinants of these changes. Using the neo-institutional methodology, the authors analyse the evolution of the value determinants of Denmark's immigration policy and look at the national norms and practices of integrating migrants from a different cultural background. A restrictive immigration policy became possible due to a consensus between the main political forces, the left Social Democratic Party and the right Liberal Party Venstre, both willing to keep in check electoral support for the radical right-wing parties (the effect of `contagion from the right' in Maurice Duverger's terms). The object of Denmark's restrictive integration policy is migrants from a different cultural background (mainly from Muslim countries). The government takes systematic measures to restrict their access to the country. As to migrant integration, the focus has shifted to `hard' assimilation of civi. democratic values, benefits linked to employment, and deportation of migrants who have committed crimes.

AB Hotelling-Downs model is a classic model of political competition and strategizing candidates, almost always analyzed under plurality. Our paper presents a three-pronged development of the Hotelling-Downs model. First, we analyze competition under a variety of voting rules. Second, we consider not only a linear city model, but also a circular city model. Third, unlike most Hotelling-Downs papers, we solve the model under the winner-takes-all assumption, which saves many equilibria, and is more relevant to voting settings. In the case of three and four candidates we have found a measure of the set of equilibria.

AB The science of public administration is widely recognized as interdisciplinary, integrating a number of other social sciences. Although there is no unity about the sciences that should be included in the composition of the sources for the public administration's study, the most common in the world literature are suggestions about political, managerial, legal sciences, and sociology. Economics is also mentioned, however, the theories and models that can make a significant contribution to improving the current state of the public administration science are not discussed. This article analyzes a widespread concept of New Public Management. We show how the elements that generate negative consequences in the provision of a number of public services, such as healthcare and education, are "embedded" in the design of this approach to reform the public administration system. These consequences occur due to the use of incentive contracts in which the valid measures of quality of services cannot be implemented. This fact encourages employees to engage in opportunistic behavior in the form of gaming. Many people call these negative consequences "unintended", although they are such only because the reformers did not know a number of the principal-agent model and contract theory statements, which were already obtained at the beginning of the wide proliferation of the New Public Management. However, in the world literature there is a widespread point of view according to which the principal-agent model is among the scientific foundations of the New Public Management, which is far from reality. The article substantiates a number of economic theories to underpin public administration, to improve the quality of scientific foundation, as well as the level of education in this field.

AB Today the world is going through a period of rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI). Advances in this field determine the creation of machines capable of learning and performing of previously purely human cognitive tasks. AI is one of the key elements in the era of convergence of technologies, which is associated with profound consequences for humans, culture, society and environment. Since AI is a cognitive technology, its various aspects are inextricably linked with the main forms of human activity: education, science, culture and communication. Algorithms of social networks and news sites can contribute to the spread of misinformation and affect the perception of the concepts 'facts' and 'truth', affect political interaction and activity. Machine learning can reinforce and deepen bias, which, in turn, can increase inequality and alienation, pose a threat to cultural diversity. The scale and power of AI technologies increase the asymmetry between individuals, groups and countries, which is manifested in the 'digital divide' within and between countries. Thus, although AI has the potential to change the future of humanity for the better, people are increasingly aware of the risks and challenges of this technology, especially in terms of aggravating existing inequalities and imbalances, and its consequences for human rights. To develop possible scenarios and to use the potential of AI for development aims under the control over risks, we need a more comprehensive understanding of how society is changing under the influence of such a revolutionary technology as AI.

AB The active penetration of digital communications into crucial areas of the state and society, the intensive development of artificial intelligence technologies and neural network algorithms, the growing influence of digital platforms as new actors of modern socio-political processes, the reconfiguration of the usual system of social relations in the digital space warrant a review of the content and functional aspects of the traditional phenomenon of subjectness, which is one of the essential elements of the structure of power and society. Carrying out a critical analysis of the current scientific discourse in the field of transformations of traditional subjectness, the authors consider the concepts of platform capitalism and algocracy as explanatory models of the changes taking place in the system of modern socio-political communications. The study shows that digitalization and technological transformations, the formation of a new sociotechnical phygital space have not simply made adjustments to the sphere of subjectness familiar to us but also intensified the processes of its evolution. As a new phenomenon emerging in the digital space, atypical subjectivity is highlighted, associated with the potential for self-communication of AI agents in the conditions of the formation of artificial sociality. Special attention is paid to the new phenomenon of hybrid subjectness, formed within the framework of the functioning of digital centaurs, potentially capable of acting as extensions of the existing political institutions of the state. An attempt is made to show how the modern algorithmizing and technologization of the sphere of socio-political communications are consistent with the approaches of G. Agamben and F. Ankersmit, dedicated to the phenomenon of the "empty political center". Although the prospects for the formation of new types of subjectness considered in work have not been realized today and are limited by modern technological capabilities, the article nonetheless outlines the potential for their implementation. Two key factors determine this potential: the exponential increase in the complexity of AI-technologies and the trend according to which modern people are increasingly inclined to rely on the ready-made solutions of AI systems.

AB Based on the analysis of the sociological, political, psychological and other research by domestic and foreign authors this paper deals with social processes that determine the choice by the new generations of one or another life pathway version. Rapidly changing social fundamentals and greater "chaotization" processes in the post-modern era further specific coming-of-age tendencies. Academic literature deals mostly with following main factors accompanying coming-of-age process of millennials: prolonged youth period, non-linear and varying variants of life trajectories, cycling of events in a young person's life. It became clear that in terms of social instability, life increasingly affects attitudes and behaviors of young people and requires of them to be flexible in adapting to permanent social transformations, choosing most effective adaptation strategies. Different variants of life, professional and other trajectories of a person in "late modern" era are discussed. New models of success or, vice versa, risks, preventing successful social adaptation developing in Russia and foreign countries are analyzed. Geography of the study presented in this project is not limited to Russia, Europe and the USA, but also includes Latin American, Asian and African countries.

AB The purpose of the article is to update the civilizational analytical literature and to reveal heuristic possibilities for researching "new barbarism" as a sociocultural and political phenomenon that depletes human capital. The methodological basis of the work is the "civilizational turn" in social knowledge. Based on the works of P.A. Sorokin, S. Eisenstadt, J. Arnason, the authors consider "new barbarism" as a product of the increasingly complex nonlinear development of modern civilization, brought about by the emergence of the newest "axial contradictions". The ambivalence resulting from the complication of social realities has a number of positive aspects, including intercultural and intercivilizational interactions, but also a negative side, leading to archaization, social and political destructiveness, which are at the origins of the "new barbarism". The spread of "new barbarism" is associated with the destruction of the cultural and civilizational heritage of mankind. A special focus is put on the analysis of the phenomenon of "digital barbarism" developing in the context of "secondary axial breakthroughs" of the fourth technological modernization. The basic contradictions of modern development, leading to the spread of "digital barbarism", are highlighted, including the gaps between the growth of freedom due to the development of digital communications and new forms of social control and surveillance; between the need for new knowledge, creativity, and the devaluation of education and science; between the availability of information, an increase in the production of meanings and the alienation from cultural values, the real life of people. It is concluded that the humanistic approach to technological development is in demand as it can contribute to minimizing various manifestations of the "new barbarism".

DT Article
DE regionalism; international relations; independence; influence;
   conflicts; normalization; challenges; values; interests; Middle East
AB The concept of regionalism is based on identity, i.e. the cultural, historical, political association of individuals, peoples, states, leaders with a certain region. Regionalization is associated with institution-building or the conclusion of formal agreements which are sometimes substituted or supplemented by informal ties. The article analyzes the processes of regionalization in the Middle East. Regionalization in the Middle East is affected by contradictory trends. The Middle East has always been considered a highly conflict-prone zone, little affected by changes in the external environment. The conflicts themselves have become the system-forming elements, which in their own way tightened this space and ensured the building of coalitions and alliances. Modern conflicts, most of which have become rapidly internationalizing intra-state confrontations, and the general increase in militarization are still eminent characteristics of the Middle East subsystem of international relations. At the same time, the trends towards the rapprochement of individual opponents and normalization are becoming clearer, and their further development could possibly play an integration role in the future. The involvement of both states and non-state or quasi-state actors in these processes is noteworthy. There is a growing independence of the leading regional states as well as an activation of small countries driven by their national interests. The continued fragmentation of the Middle East cannot be equaled to the absence of common features of regional identity and interdependence of states. It also does not exclude the attempts of different parties to develop group strategies in response to common challenges. The building of new logistics and transport routes, the expansion of trade and economic relations between individual countries have all contributed to the regionalization of the Middle East.

AB The military-political reconfiguration of the post-Soviet space that is comparable in its scale and possible consequences to the process of the collapse of the former USSR is taking place now. This development makes topical the study of the roots of the Eurasian conflict and the trajectories of its development. The author of the article has chosen the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict as an analytical pattern in order to reconceptualize some explanation models and redefine key definitions concerning it. The study represents a greater panoramic view on the spectrum of the Armenian-Azerbaijani disputes. Following E. Azar theoretical ideas, he identifies the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict as a protracted social one covering both ethnic, intercommunal, interstate, national and external dimensions. He also pays attention to the major concepts of the K. Deutsch communication theory. The author traces the spread of nationalism strategies in the South Caucasus in parallel with modernization, urbanization and growth of literacy. He connects the strengthening of these strategies with the first experience of Armenian and Azerbaijani nation-states in 1918-1920 and subsequent "Sovetization" of both republics. Particularly underlying the Soviet techniques that address the nationalism, the author concludes that the specific political experience in the USSR promoted ethno-territorial nationalism. Thus, by the eve of the Soviet Union's demise both republics were ready to launch new editions of their nation-states. Traditionally, scholars, while addressing the confrontation, oppose the Karabakh Armenian fight for national liberation and Armenian occupation of some Azerbaijani areas. The author examines the particularities of the two aforementioned formats of the conflict after the dissolution of the USSR and offers an explanation framework to the new realities of the current state of this conflict after the "second Karabakh war" of 2020.

   agendas; proneness to conflict; swing voters
AB After two years in the White House, President Joe Biden, who was elected as a centrist, despite his success in implementing his social agenda by building a compromise with Congress divided between left-wing Democrats and right-wing Republicans, still embraces radical far-left agenda as the next campaign strategy. The Democratic Party consolidates in its progressive agenda which will dominate its ideological development. J. Biden's formula for success - compromise and centrism, which brought him victory in 2020, over the two years of his stay in the White House proved to be precisely the working formula for interaction with Congress and implementation of social programs. After several months of record low ratings, in August 2022, the popularity of the President improved markedly, returning to the figures of September 2021. The 44% that he received in his support still meant that the majority of society did not approve of his presidency, but it was obvious that his efforts to advance his agenda were appreciated by the public. However, the most important thing about this growth is that it was provided by independent voters. It was their support that the President began to lose after only five months of his stay in the White House, their low assessment explained the depressing support numbers of Summer 2022, and only they could return J. Biden to the game on the eve of the midterm elections, turning him from a burden for his party into its hope. Still independent voters are the most difficult audience for parties and presidents, because unlike the emotionally charged core party supporters who are ready to positively evaluate the president just because he represents their party, the swing voters evaluate the results of the presidency, not the party affiliation. And the return of this electorate to Biden after several legislative victories was a positive assessment of the effectiveness of his government strategy based on compromise. Yet there are big doubts that the Democrats are ready to hear and accept this signal of the swing voters. The logical reorientation of parties towards independent voters and a necessary shift of the agenda to the center of the ideological spectrum is complicated by the instability of moods in this part of society, the complexity of monitoring and forecasting them. Given the prevalence of the logic of electoral struggle, which changes all the social functions of political parties, such a reorientation violates the current basic principle of the American parties' ideological organization - the success of the agenda is determined by victory in the elections. With the dominance of this logic, it can be assumed that the left-wing vector of the Democratic Party's development will increase, forcing J. Biden not only to strengthen the left rhetoric, but also to expand the left agenda of his presidency, especially if his party loses control over Congress. The whole domestic political process will be still determined by the ideological conflict between two radical agendas - far-left and far-right.

Post-Soviet Russia has not created a system of partnerships in the region that would ensure the stability of foreign policy outcomes in the face of fluctuations of the regional conjuncture. Un analisis exhaustivo de la politica exterior de Rusia en America Latina y el Caribe muestra que, si bien las relaciones interestatales variaron en el primer cuarto del siglo XXI con cambios en el entorno internacional y la situacion sociopolitica exterior e interna, esta politica fue simbolica, poco recomendable y reactiva.

AB The article analyzes the results of the first Emmanuel Macron's presidential five-year term. The authors highlight that the period 2017-2022 proved to be a time of ambitious undertakings and difficult trials for France. The young president sensitively caught the French desire for change and set about solving urgent problems. The improvement of public finances and reboot of the economy, modernization of the administration of the Republic with expansion of "social lifts", the return of France's leadership in the European Union and strengthening of the EU's position in the world - these were the main goals of Macron. Nevertheless, these plans ran into serious objections: inside the country - via the mass protests of working classes defending social guarantees and the opposition of parliamentarians facing the strengthening of presidential power, in the international arena - due to the EU problems and the rivalry of France with a number of other powers. The COVID-19 pandemic has become a real "black swan" for the president, forcing him to adjust the initial settings. However, E. Macron had some achievements on his way - such as the Labor Code reform, political confidence laws, transformation of the ENA, development of the European Union initiatives, especially the Franco-German plan to save the EU economy during the 2020 pandemic. The authors conclude that despite Macron's re-election, his second term will become very difficult: the loss of an absolute majority in the National Assembly in the June 2022 elections showed that a tripolar system has been formed in France, so the centrist Macron will have to take the positions of the extreme right and left forces into account when building his economic and domestic policy. As for his foreign policy, the main troubles lie in the serious aggravation of the international situation in Europe.

AB The methods and tools used by the European Union to counter hybrid threats are identified: from the fight against terrorism to measures aimed at combating economic competitors and political opponents (mainly, to squeeze Russia and China out of European markets). It is concluded that it is not by chance that neither EU institutions nor the research community have worked out a comprehensive definition of operations to combat hybrid threats. A broad understanding of hybrid threats as practically any (depending on the political situation) actions of the opponent serves to justify the application of any counteraction tool. In the fight against global threats such as terrorism, cybercrime, and the spread of false medical data, the EU takes a systemic approach, which makes it possible to assess the level and degree of the convergence of threats to critical infrastructure and the infosphere, as well as the possibilities of counteraction. At the same time, attempts to use economic, legislative, political, and informational tools to achieve one-sided economic, political, and military advantages do not reduce the degree of tension in the EU's relations with Russia, China, and some other countries, only increasing the number and strength of hybrid threats. This reduces the EU's ability to achieve strategic autonomy.

AB Germany's transition to a climate-neutral economy, the main parameters of which were determined by the European Green Exchange Rate (December 2019) and clarified in the updated Law on Climate Protection of Germany (June 2021) and the EU Fit-for-55 program (July 2021), leads to the abandonment of the use of primary energy sources, including their importation from Russia. The energy transformation of the German market economy presumed a gradual restructuring of the existing model of German-Russian cooperation in the energy sector, including its transfer to priority cooperation in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. Brussels and Berlin responded to the special military operation of the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine with large-scale economic and political sanctions, which included significant restrictions on the import of Russian coal and oil. At the same time, the German federal authorities outlined the necessity to abandon Russian pipeline gas and petroleum products, as well as the deprivation of ownership of the two main players from the Russian Federation in the German oil and gas market-Gazprom and Rosneft. Their German partners have frozen participation in Russian projects. At the end of February, the certification of the Nord Stream-2 offshore gas pipeline was stopped. Interdepartmental state interaction and scientific and technical cooperation in the energy sector have been terminated. These events indicated the readiness of the government coalition in the short term to replace the previous model of energy cooperation, which has performed well for half a century, and to move to independence from Russian fossil resources and their derivatives. The author analyzes the reasons and content of the current measures taken by Berlin, as well as their medium- and long-term consequences for German-Russian cooperation.

AB The studies that have generated the present article have been sparked by a timely question: how does the waning of Western military presence in Afghanistan impact the wider region around this country? The implications of this process go far beyond the immediate effects of the reduction of forces by the U.S. and its allies in the coalition led by NATO. The states in close geographic proximity to Afghanistan, as well as other external powers, notably Russia, have interests in how the transformation of the regional security environment occurs. This article provides background information for understanding the Biden administration's decision to complete the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, assesses the reaction of neighboring countries to the rise of the Taliban, and examines the political and military consequences of regime change in Afghanistan and their impact on regional security. Some additional lines of research are considered as needed. The article ends with considerations and conclusions regarding the possible impact of the current situation in Afghanistan on the subsequent US policy in the region.

The events of 1470-1471, namely, the attempts to call into service a prince from Lithuania, to conclude an alliance with Lithuania and with the Teutonic Order in Livonia, and the campaign of Ivan III and the military defeat of Lord Novgorod the Great, have been considered on a wide background of social and political development of Novgorod the Great throughout the fifteenth century, in the context of the history of its foreign relations and the position of its neighbors, the organization of its armed forces, with a comprehensive account of a variety of sources (not only chronicles but also charters, epistolary and literary sources, etc.) and a rich research literature. In contrast to the approaches widespread in historiography, emphasis has been placed on contemporary reliable sources rather than on later ideological interpretations. Analysis of the chronicles also involves textual criticism. The authors have come to the conclusion that the defeat of the Novgorod Republic was caused not only by social, particularly religious, conflicts that were emphasized by the Moscow side but rather by the complex international situation, which the military and political organization of Novgorod was no longer consistent with, and the inability of the opposing pro-Moscow and pro-Lithuanian parties to offer a convincing ideological line and, consequently, strategy of action in these circumstances.

AB The article focuses on how Russian conservative journals in 1890-1894 discussed the Rusin question in Galicia, Bukovina, and Transcarpathia in connection with some noticeable political changes in Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Germany. Drawing on the research of public opinion in the Russian Empire, the author analyses the study of the Rusin question in the last third of the 19th century and argues that little is known about the reflection of the Rusin question in the Russian public consciousness in the 1890s. He analyses the stance of Fedor Berg's Russky Vestnik on the Rusin question based on the example of Sergei Tatishchev's articles. Tatishchev considered the liberation of Galicia from Austrian domination in theory. The main attention is paid to the evolution of the Russkoe obozrenie - this new type of a conservative journal under Prince Dmitry Tsertelev was skeptical about helping foreign Slavs and avoided extensive comments about Rusins. In the new editorial board headed by Alexander Alexandrov, the key role belonged to the pan-Slavist Sergei Sharapov, whose sympathies for the Poles and Hungarians did not prevent him from raising the question of the Rusin liberation. The new editorial policy in 1893-1894 allowed publishing important materials on the history and current political and ecclesiastical situation in Galicia, Bukovina, and Transcarpathia. The journalists discussed the resettlement of Rusins in the Russian Empire and the activities of Ivan Naumovich and Adolf Dobryansky. The author concludes that Russian conservative journals did not pay enough attention to the Rusin question and its strategic importance.

AB The paper considers the main theoretical and practical legal issues related to implementing the key provisions of the principle of separation of municipal powers, which is a conceptual basis for preventing competency conflicts in municipalities. The authors used a set of methods: dialectical, logical, historical, formal-legal, scientific cognition through the use of reference, values-based, systemic, functional, and informational approaches. In order to update the existing system, the study proposes a set of legal measures aimed at improving the relevant municipal legal structures. This study should aim at developing an integral theoretical platform that could lay the basis for subsequent changes in the current legislation on the system of municipal public authorities in the Russian Federation.

TI PEACE PROCESS: ON SUBSTANTIVE DEFINITION
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE peace processes; negotiations; peace agreements; ceasefires; armed
   conflicts; conflict outcomes
AB Prevailing formal, technical definition of the "peace process" reduces it to a more or less linear sequence of peace agreements. Such definitions lack substance and do not fully account for realities of contemporary conflicts and conflict management. Nor does empirical evidence support inherently positive interpretations of the notion of the "peace process" that are still widespread and create heightened expectations about such processes' outcomes. During past four decades, two thirds of armed conflicts lacked any peace process. In the first two decades of the 21st century, negotiated outcomes accounted for just a quarter of all conflict outcomes. Nor do peace processes, launched due to war and mostly during war, require or quickly lead to sustained secession of fire that is more likely to take place at the later stages of the process. Realities of contemporary peace processes hardly match any "ideal model" of a linear process that leads to a comprehensive peace agreement. Full and final peace agreements are becoming less frequent, while on-and-off, nonlinear, parallel, fragmented negotiations, ceasefires, partial and local agreements proliferate. The very notion of a peace process as a mere sequence of formal written agreements is inadequate, even as individual agreements are easier to identify, code and count in respective datasets. The article argues that the way to define a peace process, identify and distinguish it from other conflict-related negotiations and contacts requires qualitative analysis of its substance. It inspects and revises two basic substantive criteria of the "peace process" definition that deal with what the parties are talking about and who the negotiating parties are. Unlike technical contacts or ceasefires, peace processes are not mainly about discussing forms and methods of warfare or its humanitarian symptoms, but are primarily centered on dialogue between conflict parties on key underlying incompatibilities over which the conflict has been fought. Such incompatibilities always have a political dimension (socio-political, ideological, related to ethnic/religious/sociocultural identity, political economy, and international (geo)politics). The article suggests to place the main focus on the peace process rather than on individual agreements as its (interim) products. It also argues for making the need to address key incompatibilities at dispute a sine qua non criterion for any negotiations to qualify for a peace process. This allows to distinguish peace processes from more technical talks and most ceasefires, to account for a broader range of substantive negotiation formats (including initiatives that did not lead to an agreement), and to identify when a peace process starts (whenever talks on key contested incompatibilities begin). Decline in sustained, comprehensive, final peace agreements coupled with the rise in ceasefires, temporary partial agreements and locally negotiated deals do not necessarily imply decline in, or marginalization of, peace processes. On the contrary, this only underscores the imperative of handling a focused, substantive negotiation process over feverish "race for agreements" that are often premature or externally imposed upon the conflict parties. The second mandatory definitional criterion pertains to which armed actors' involvement is principal or decisive for settling key incompatibilities and which ones could be sidelined and further marginalized with no major detriment to the peace process.
   The former include main military actors, with major presence on the ground and a degree of social support. These actors cannot be substituted for by international stakeholders/mediators or civil society groups. A negotiation format that ignores the principle "one does not choose one's enemy/negotiation protagonist" and fails to directly involve representatives of the main protagonists on the ground hardly qualifies for a peace process. Fragmentation of violence and proliferation of non-state actors in modern conflicts further actualize the need to set certain limits for the peace process's inclusiveness and distinguish key parties from smaller, more local or ultra-radical, irreconcilable actors. While a degree of armed actor's social support is important, a decisive parameter is often an armed actor's overall, especially military, potential sufficient to destabilize any peace process that it is not part of. At the same time, the range of potential participants in peace processes could also be reasonably broadened, especially with regard to non-state actors, to better reflect evolving conflict patterns. This could be done by extending the notion of peace processes to include substantive talks not only with, but also between major non-state actors. Local agreements and ceasefires could also sometimes be seen as part of a peace process, but only provided they are to some degree related to the conflict's key political incompatibilities. Overall, a peace process should neither be seen as an end in itself to be achieved at any price, nor downgraded to a category secondary to a peace agreement. Of key relevance for defining and identifying a peace process is its substance, inclusiveness, and pertinence to central issues contested by military means. The article postulates and attests the primacy of (a) qualitative criteria and analysis for adequate definition of a peace process and (b) a category of "peace process" over peace/ceasefire agreements.

AB The paper presents a characteristic of the dynamics of the development of the network of rural settlements of the Tobolsk district/county in the second half of the XIX - first third of the XX centuries. Based on the calculation of the data contained in a mass statistical source ("Lists of populated places"), the number of rural settlements, their typical structure and size for several time slices, as well as infrastructure are determined. The influence of changing political and socio-economic conditions on the scale of the settlement network, its typology, indicators of the yard and population is analyzed. Changes in qualitative and quantitative indicators of the development of the rural settlement network of the district in the period under review are traced. New types of settlements are coming to replace the settlements, repairs, outposts disappearing by the beginning of the XX century - resettlement settlements, farms. In the first decades of Soviet power, villages with a new status appeared - agricultural communes. The variability of the quantitative growth of settlements was noted: in the period from 1868/1869 to 1893, the number of villages in the district increased, from 1893 to 1926, on the contrary, decreased. The conclusion is made about the predominance of small settlements in the settlement network of up to 25 households, changes in the size of Tobolsk households that were outlined by 1926. The transformation of the social infrastructure of the settlement network of the district/county in the period under review is traced. It manifested itself in the reduction of the number of private trading establishments, the emergence of cooperative organizations in rural areas, the development of the school network and an increase in the number of medical centers, the disappearance in the 1920s of religious institutions (churches, chapels, mosques, prayer houses), the expansion of the network of communication institutions.

AB The crises of the XXI century made the reflections on the solidarity and unity of the EU urgent again. The research aim is to explore the application of two notions, namely the European Union and Europe for two striking cases, namely the UK and the Visegrad states positions on the issues of European integration. These countries are geographically the peripheral states of the European Union and, therefore, they may be examined under the general philosophical approach to the dichotomy between the core and the periphery. This approach provides for suggestions that taking into account recent difficulties the EU has been facing, the EU periphery has escaped the control of the core that is the status gained by Brussels (the UK case) or has tried to weaken the core (the Visegrad states case). The migration factor that is still very urgent serves not exactly the cause but the manifestation or the proof of the periphery instability. Brexit was the starting point for the UK to separate the notions of the European Union and Europe that seemed to have merged as synonyms. The case shows that the EU notion has narrowed, while on the contrary the importance of Europe as the region not limited to the EU has increased. The case of the Visegrad countries demonstrates that despite the ambiguous attitude of the population and political elites to the EU, these states are unlikely to follow the UK scenario in the short term. At the same time the group displays sustained euroscepticism and considers itself to be an alternative but not equal, though, format of integration in Europe. Taking into account the existing distance between the European values and European institutions (presented by the EU), the Visegrad group may be considered not only a potential troublemaker in the dichotomy between the core and the periphery during the crises in the EU, but also the group of states that considers itself to have the right to behave in its independent way without following completely the instructions from Brussels. The authors conclude that the countries at the periphery of the European Union are unlikely to consider the EU and Europe as equal notions. The countries of the EU periphery are striving for their unique place and cooperation format that may not coincide with the EU. None of them deny being European instead aiming at proving their Europeaness both inside and outside the EU. However, the UK may find its place outside the EU while it is more difficult for the Visegrad group countries that do not seem to have any viable alternatives.

AB In the case of an intercepting massive nuclear missile attack, the technical capabilities of modern missile defense systems remain poor, nevertheless, the options for using the latest missile defense systems go beyond the "classic nuclear scenario". First and foremost, missile defense systems have been used in conventional armed conflicts. This practice has already demonstrated their combat effectiveness which has become an impetus for the ongoing technical modernization of their main elements. In recent years, the conflict scenarios have been worked out in the United States and Russia where the limited use of low-yield nuclear weapons is allowed. The limited nuclear strike can be launched at the initial stages of a traditional conflict to consolidate the acquired military benefits and disrupt the enemy's counteroffensive. Obviously, the limited use of nuclear weapons is fraught with an aggravation of the risk of a rapid and uncontrolled nuclear escalation. Unexpectedly, in this context, missile defense becomes a severe deterrent. Missile defense systems deployed at critical military facilities can remove the incentives for the limited nuclear strike as well as give considerable strategic and political advantages. Under these circumstances, missile defense systems become key players in the military balance. To reduce the risks of the limited use of nuclear weapons the author proposes "a roadmap" based on revitalization of the main arms control regimes and use of the capabilities of modern missile defense systems. It is hypothesized that "thin" missile defense removes the incentive to launch the first limited nuclear strike, thus enhancing strategic stability.

AB The article analyzes the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war in terms of a colonial seizure undertaken by a fading but aggressive Russian empire. This highly political adventure is translated into more abstract terms, that is, an irresolvable conflict between existence, which is always the experience of coexistence devoid of any essence whatsoever, and imperial expansion, which is an infinite conquest of space indifferent to all forms of life. The dualism in question is backed up by the writings of two important scholars, namely, the French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy and the Russian scientist and revolutionary Peter Kropotkin. Nancy's philosophy of being-in-common is the development of Heidegger's concept of Mitsein, where the meaning of Mit- (co-, with) is existential and not categorical. Nancy's philosophy challenges all forms of communal essence, of which empire is one blatant example. For Kropotkin, existence is even more all-embracing, implying a continuity of different life forms. His doctrine of mutual aid is a law that governs both society and nature, as well as evolution itself. Even morality springs from "solidarity" and the joys of social life, while sympathy or love are too narrow a basis for human ethics. Viewed from this perspective, a colonial war would not only be the greatest waste of human lives and natural resources-it would contradict the very order of things.

ID LEGITIMATION
AB In 2017-21, the symbol of childhood became especially noticeable in the polit-ical life of Russia due to the participation of minors in protest activity and the involvement of the age factor in political rhetoric. Based on an analysis of political discourse, media publications, and in-terviews, the authors conclude that the slogan of saving children served as a weapon in both the legitimation of power and its delegitimation. The opposi-tion criticized the Kremlin for its alleged cruelty towards underage protesters and represented the authorities as outdated. The authorities accused the liberal opposition of manipulating the minds of minors; jeopardizing their health and life; and also carrying out the work of the Western secret services that were trying to split Russian society by age. The Kremlin positions itself as a pillar of strength of not only the physical but also the spiritual health of children. The public opinion survey shows that for the informants the question of whether the authorities protected children or displayed cruelty towards them was important for their evaluation of the legitimacy of power.

AB The article examines the connection between the environmental processes during the COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2022) and the "greening" of the political sphere. A specific feature of environmental policy is its close linkage with the economy, since economic activity is the direct cause of anthropogenic pollution of natural environments. The environmental changes that have arisen in response to economic realities of the pandemic period have led to transformation of socio-political attitudes towards strengthening the "green" direction in the policies of the world's leading states - the European Union member countries, the United States, Russia, China and other. The global "green agenda" was substantiated at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2020 and 2021, as well as at the following 26th UN Climate Change Conference 2021 (COP26) in Glasgow, actually shaping a new world order based on the environmental goals and obligations. In West European countries, with prominent green parties' political positions, the environmental policy is formed largely from grassroots. In the United States, it depends entirely on the political situation (mostly on the sitting president's party affiliation). Whereas the European Union and the EU states (primarily Germany and France) have seized the initiative of directing the world environmental policy, striving to take the lead in this sphere (particularly, in climate protection), the new U.S. government is now seriously challenging the European leadership. Noteworthy is that the COVID-19 crisis has updated the green political and economic agenda globally, regardless of differences between the states, which verifies the importance and necessity of agreeing a conceptually new common approach to interaction with the environment in the short and long term.

ID POST-ISLAMISM
AB The evolution of Islamism/political Islam as an ideological system is analyzed. This system was formed in the 1970s-1980s and initially played the role of a progressive and alternative model, replacing the previously dominant ideas of Arab nationalism. However, the Islamists failed to fully achieve one of their main goals-the creation of an Islamic state-because of the deterrence of secular authoritarian states. The events in the Persian Gulf and the temporary drop in oil prices in the late 1990s aggravated the ideological crisis of Islamism and led to its rethinking. As a solution, a more liberal version of Islamism was proposed in the form of post-Islamism, which combined Islamic and democratic principles and was focused on duties rather than human rights. The next milestone in liberalizing Islamist ideas was the events of the Arab Spring, which led to a rethinking of post-Islamist ideas, as well as the liberalization and politization of the Salafi doctrine. Moreover, the failures of a number of Islamist parties in achieving political power, as well as the activities of radical Islamist groups, discredited Islamism among the population of the Middle East and North Africa. It is likely that the next crisis of Islamism will lead to its further liberalization or the formation of a new ideological model.

DT Article
DE indexical; meaning; reference; context; semantic; pragmatics
AB The article deals with the problem of indexical reference in general and the reference of the first-person pronoun "I" in particular. First, I briefly present David Kaplan's semantics for indexical expressions based on the character/content distinction and point out some of its difficulties related to the alleged identity between the context of utterance and the semantically relevant context, i.e., the context relevant for indexical reference determination. Because of this identity, the Kaplanian semantics cannot account for many successful communicative situations where speakers use indexical utterances. The most famous example of such a situation is Alan Sidelle's answering machine paradox, which requires the utterances of "I am not here now" to be true, but according to the Kaplanian semantics, these utterances should be necessarily false. Second, I overview the different solutions to the paradox as well as to other similar cases presented by a variety of Kaplan's critics. Most of them (except Sidelle himself) insist on modifying the Kaplanian semantics. I consider three such approaches to modification (the intentional, the conventional, and the communicative ones) and conclude that their common idea of distinguishing between the context of utterance and the semantically relevant context presupposes another account of the relationships between semantics and pragmatics. Finally, I argue that the discussed modification does concern only semantics of indexical expressions and should not be confused with their pragmatics. The reason for that is the very nature of semantics: any successful semantic theory should explain what the reference of linguistic expressions is and how it is fixed. The context-dependence of indexical reference does not change the goal of semantics, it only makes it more difficult to achieve.

AB On the anniversary of the centenary of the formation of the Soviet Union, we naturally remember the name and ideas of one of the most brilliant Soviet agricultural economists, who made a huge practical and theoretical contribution to attempts to reform not only Soviet agriculture but also Soviet society as a whole. Vladimir Grigoryevich Venzher (1899-1990) was an agriculturist and economist, who primarily became widely known for his correspondence with Stalin in the early 1950s about the possibilities of reforms in the collective farm system of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the fact that his personality was much broader and deeper than his professional incarnation as an agrarian economist. Venzher, of course, was also an original and deep social thinker, partly Marxist and partly populist-cooperative, who repeatedly proposed to the Soviet leadership and then in relation to the Kosygin and Gorbachev reforms a number of comprehensive alternative reforms aimed at shaping the sustainable development of the Soviet Union and Russia based primarily on the required agrarian reforms.(1) To prove and develop this statement, this article examines several key fragments of the political economy and social and philosophical heritage of Venzher in the 1960s-1980s, his letters to the Central Committee of the CPSU, and some of his scientific monographs, which have not yet attracted much attention from researchers.

DE the Baltics; tautininkai; Vilnius region; international relations
AB The article analyzes the nuances of the changes in Soviet-Lithuanian relations after the coup d'etat staged in December 1926. The coming to power of the leaders of the Lithuanian Nationalist and Republican Union A. Smetona and A. Voldemaras initially contributed to the situation of uncertainty in bilateral relations. Moscow was extremely concerned about Voldemaras' desire to exacerbate the Polish-Soviet contradictions in order to solve the Vilnius problem in Polish-Lithuanian relations. The Soviet diplomats feared that Voldemaras could provoke an armed conflict with Poland and that the Soviet Union would inevitably be involved in the conflict. On the other hand, Soviet diplomacy was interested in maintaining both the independence of Lithuania and the maintenance of some tension between Poland and Lithuania, as this situation created obstacles to Poland's spread of influence throughout the Baltic East. By the late 1920s, it became apparent to Moscow that dissatisfaction with Voldemaras' policy in Lithuania had reached its climax and that Voldemaras was to be forced out of Lithuanian political life in the near future. As a result, a few months before Voldemaras' resignation, the political leadership of the USSR categorically opposed contacts with him by the leadership of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.

AB The author explores the history of the Danish People's Party and its effect on Danish immigration policy. The DPP was founded in 1995. It successfully continued the anti-immigration course of the Danish Progress Party fallen into disrepair. The Danish People's Party represented a synthesis of several political currents: the Lutheran movement Tidehverv and its journal, intellectual nationalists from the Danish Association, and conservative populists from the Progress Party. The DPP seeks to drastically reduce non-Western immigration, opposes Islamization and favors cultural assimilation of immigrants. For 25 years, the Danish People's Party has managed to maneuver between establishment parties and their small partners in the complicated multi-party political system of Denmark. Dissociated from radical elements, the DPP has occupied a stable position on the right of the traditional bourgeois parties. It has broken the long-term influence of centrist parties, and especially radical left-wing parties, on Danish policy. Collaboration with liberal-conservative forces from 2001 to 2011 and from 2015 to 2019 was the most productive for the Party. The DPP played a key role in writing the rules and conditions for immigration in the immigration law that was established by the government in May 2002. Most importantly, the document provided for strong restrictions in immigration policies, which resulted in what is often described as Europe's strictest immigration laws. The 24-year rule has drawn a lot of attention. Thanks to European migrant crisis, the 2015 general election was historic for the Danish People's Party. It got unprecedented electoral support and became Denmark's second largest political party. However, the Party suffered a major defeat in the 2019 general election, recording its worst result since the establishment by wining 8.7% of votes - down from 21% in 2015, for the following reasons: depletion of anti-immigrant rhetoric and seizing the traditional DPP initiative by the establishment, increased political competition and party's collaboration with the Social Democrats, unexpected for the DPP voters.

AB The article examines the characteristics of "digital children" from the perspective of the theories of generations by Neil Howe and William Strauss, presents a modern interpretation of the theory in the works of domestic and foreign researchers. In domestic science, the characteristics of the digital generation are studied from the point of view of the psychological characteristics of representatives of the generation and the pedagogical influence on them, taking into account the informatization of educational institutions, the introduction of distance learning. This generation is characterized by a new - digital - type of socialization, which means the influence of the Internet technology and the virtual environment on the formation of values and attitudes, social practices of young people. Generation Z is a superior generation in many ways. It is the largest, most ethnically diverse and financially influential generation in human history. In the coming years, their characteristics will determine the formation of world culture, economy and politics. The youth of Generation Z inherits the degree of development of society, forms the image of the future, and is considered as the potential for the life of society. Due to insufficient practical development of this issue, there is a need for a systematic approach to studying the specific features of Generation Z, not only within the framework of the socio-psychological environment, but also the motives of their activities in political and socioeconomic systems, behavior patterns and features of their socialization. To examine the socio-psychological characteristics of the studied generation, the authors conducted a focus group study. In the study, the authors identified nine blocks for qualitative analysis: (1) characteristics of Generation Z; (2) relationship with parents; (3) leisure activities of Generation Z; (4) communication in network communities; (5) values of Generation Z; (6) positive and negative emotions of Generation Z; (7) communication with peers; (8) professional self-determination of Generation Z; (9) attitude towards patriotism. The highlighted blocks for analysis define a systematic approach to the study of characteristics and social practices. The study of isolated cases, subjective experiences of life situations and real practices that develop in various types of interaction allows us to understand the digital generation, to confirm or destroy the myths that have developed in the scientific community and the mass consciousness. The authors of the article draw conclusions about the characteristics and social practices of Generation Z, and the main forms of their interaction in the main spheres of life of modern society.

AB In the early 1990s, Russian and US observers were pessimistic about Russian science and its global integration. Yet scientists from the two countries were actively collaborating in new ways nonetheless. In order to explore the nature of those collaborations, we conducted open-ended interviews with 13 US scientists and 13 in Russia who collaborated trans-nationally in 1995-2014. Our results suggest that recognizing and working with differences benefited these colleagues. Despite ongoing political tensions and differences in scientific cultures, respondents told us that understanding those differences - in funding, cultures of doing science, institutional structures, and treatment of graduate students - helped them avoid missteps. Respect for each other's country's scientific contributions, interpersonal diplomacy, and personal interconnections further strengthened their work together. Diaspora scientists in particular, played a positive role as mediators and cultural interpreters.

   Revolution; economic policy
AB The article analyzes the changes that took place during the solution of the so-called 'Chinese question' on the basis of the journals of the Interdepartmental Consultation under the board of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which have been preserved in the Russian State Historical Archive. The peak of activity in this direction first of the tsarist government, and then of the Provisional government was from the second half of 1916 to the autumn of 1917. Documents show that the labor of recruited Chinese workers was used in many sectors of the economy. But the most important it received in the railway construction. Russia's military operations had slowed down the colonization of the Far East. Under these conditions, the arrival of tens of thousands of Chinese workers in the European part of the country became a peculiar reflection of the eastern direction of Russia's domestic and foreign policy. The attitude toward this phenomenon in social and political circles has changed since the formation of the Provisional Government. While pursuing the course of tsarism in solving the problem of the crisis of workers' hands, the Provisional Government simultaneously made a number of concessions to the Chinese mission in Petrograd. In particular, its representatives were given the opportunity to become acquainted with the working and living conditions of the Chinese workers. Rising unemployment and protest moods in Russian society eventually forced the Provisional Government, shortly before its fall, to abandon the transportation of foreign laborers to Russia.

AB The article is devoted to modern migration processes in Ireland. The growing Irish economy and its positive international reputation have maintained the attractiveness of the country to migrants seeking to work, study and settle here. In recent years, there has been a large increase in people choosing to become Irish citizens and, in addition, the numbers of second generation migrants continue to grow. The authors explain why Ireland does not suffer from the migration crisis in the European Union, and analyze peculiarities of migration processes in this country. The main attention is paid to immigration, but the authors also consider the dynamics of migration and underline that for many years, Ireland has been a country of emigrants. Both migration inflows and outflows are sensitive to the Irish economy and contribute to its downturn, but at the same time, such migratory flows change rapidly, sometimes in an independent way in relation to the economic recovery. Evidences are presented that labor migration is predominant in Ireland, and correlation is established between migration flows and the state of economy. The authors analyze the national composition of migration inflows, the role and place of migrants of different national and ethnical origins at the labor market and in the economy in general, underline a special position of immigrants of the Irish origin. The return flows of Irish migrants are viewed in the historical context. Ireland's policy on refugees, participation in international and EU programs of relocation and resettlement of refugees are considered as well. Some aspects of the economic migration policy conducted by the Irish government are examined. In conclusion, the authors consider in brief the Ireland's state policy for integration of immigrants into the economic, social and political life of the country.

AB This article seeks to provide an update on the scholarship that has emerged concerning the civil war in Cote d'Ivoire (2002-2011) in the post-conflict decade, and to assess it vis-a-vis subsequent developments in national Ivorian politics. The literature is analysed and categorised, including both traditional and modern approaches, with the principal objective of determining key views on the conflict that have been re-examined in the last 10 years, revealing how our knowledge of that conflict has been clarified in light of post-conflict political developments. The author reviews and explores conflict emergence explanations centred on ethnicity, institutional viability, economic dependency and foreign interference - the latter challenged by the latest analysis of trans-border regional supply lines and domestic civil-military patronage networks. Overall the article attempts to enhance existing assessments of the Ivorian civil war in terms of causes, its course and its aftermath.

DT Article
DE Russia; the USA; Ukraine; special military operation; strategic
   stability; arms control
AB The dramatic events in Ukraine, which unfolded from the end of February 2022, marked the end of an historical period of more than half a century. Relations between the USSR/Russia and the West have come full circle and returned to the Cold War, once again bringing the powers closer to the fateful line almost crossed in the days of the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. First of all, presently the reasons for contemplating the use of Russian nuclear forces might allegedly include not only an attack on Russia and its allies using nuclear or conventional weapons, but also NATO's direct involvement in local military operations on the territory of Ukraine, the provision of assistance to it with arms supplies, economic sanctions and even aggressive statements against Russia. In the West, this topic is widely discussed, including at the governmental level, despite Moscow's official statements that it does not have any nuclear plans. Secondly, the impact of the Ukrainian tragedy on strategic stability is that it directly affected the negotiations between Russia and the United States on strategic weapons, which were once again "frozen" after a successful debut in July 2021 in Geneva. Third, the current conflict has had a detrimental effect on the overall climate of political relations between states in Europe and beyond, which has always been an important foundation for arms control negotiations. If the worst-case scenario is avoided, then sooner or later the Ukrainian problem will be resolved peacefully, no matter how difficult and distant such an outcome may seem now. After that, or even in the process of moving towards peace, it is possible to resume the dialogue between Russia and the United States on arms control. This has been the case in the past, starting with the easing of tensions after the Cuban Missile Crisis and the signing of the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. After that, while resolving periodic crises, the responsible powers concluded dozens of treaties on nuclear weapons and other lethal means, which made it possible by the end of the 1980's to end the Cold War, curtail the arms race and rid the world of the specter of a nuclear Armageddon for the ensuing thirty years.

DT Article
DE linguistic situation; language policy; Rutulsky District; Dagestan;
   Dagestan languages; newly written language; areal contact
AB The article analyzes the linguistic situation in Rutulsky District of the Republic of Dagestan. Its features include ethnic diversity and multilingualism. Native speakers of six East Caucasian and Turkic languages (that are heterogeneous in their genetic characteristics) live in a relatively small area of the district. Russian is the official language of record keeping and interethnic communication there. The relevance of the research topic stems from the need to monitor trends in the development of a unique language community through the example of a particular region.The unique character of the language situation in the district is due to the combination and variation of its constituent criteria: the history of its origin, political, demographic and economic prerequisites for its formation, features of the spheres of functioning of the languages, the current state of contacts between speakers of structurally different languages through the Russian language. Some of the features are associated with the discrepancy between the present-day dwelling area of some ethnic groups inhabiting Rutulsky District and their historically native areas. The specificity of dialects and subdialects spoken by the Avars, Laks and Azerbaijanis living in the area makes it impossible for their speakers to fully communicate with representatives of the respective nationalities. Interestingly, the change of the language of interethnic communication has occurred over the past half century: the Azerbaijani language has been completely displaced by Russian.Thus, the issues of preserving native languages common to many regions of Russia are generally relevant for the ethnically heterogeneous and multilingual Rutulsky District. Nevertheless, in this case we are talking about the preservation of newly written languages (Rutul and Tsakhur) and specific dialects and subdialects of the Lak, Avar and Azerbaijani languages represented only on the territory of the study area.

ID MYTH
AB The changes in the identification sphere of young people in the South of Russia are studied. The analysis is based on the comparison of mass surveys in 2009 and 2021, the effectiveness of identity politics in the region is evaluated. The hypothesis of the study was that at the beginning of the third decade of the 21st century, the all-Russian identity has significantly strengthened compared to the end of the first decade, and this would allow to move from assessing the situation as a "competition of identities" to their complementarity. The hypothesis was partially confirmed. The importance of all socio-cultural identities that make up the "portfolio of identities" of the youth of Russian South has noticeably decreased. Indirectly, this indicates the stabilization of the ethno-social and ethno-political situation -the mobilizing character of the identity has been reduced. However, no significant dynamics in strengthening the all-Russian identity was revealed. If ethnic Russian respondents demonstrated the equivalence of the all-Russian and ethnic identities, the respondents - representatives of the Caucasian peoples showed the persisting imbalance between the key socio-cultural identities - the all-Russian and ethnic - in favor of the ethnic one, and over 12 years the imbalance has increased. A shift from formal markers (citizenship) of the all-Russian identity to substantive ones (feeling of belonging to all-Russian history and culture) was found out, which was interpreted as a trend towards the formation of a Russian civilizational identity. This is also evidenced by the growth of the number of respondents who perceive Russia as a bridge between the civilizations of the West and the East. It is concluded that, in the presence of positive trends in identification processes among the youth of the South of Russia, the refusal to evaluate the situation as a "competition of identities" would be too premature, and the identity politics in the region cannot be considered sufficiently effective.

AB The aim of the paper is to analyze the formation and the main traits of new communica-tive spaces in the form of "epistemic echo-bubbles" and "echo-cameras". Their emer-gence is associated with a transdisciplinary type of scientific revolution. Among the re-sults of this revolution is the Internet and various social networks. Their popularity among different strata of the population makes these networks are not just mass phenom-ena, but effective tools for communication and influence on the views spread in society and shared by many individuals. The mechanisms of "epistemic echo-bubbles" and "echo-chambers" are explored and described. The fundamental differences in their func-tioning are emphasized, namely, that "epistemic echo-bubbles" are formed due to the similarity of people's views (in the broad sense of life, including political life), and the emotions accompanying these views, so that subjects with different views and emo-tions are simply "not heard" within the boundaries of the echo-bubbles. Echo-chambers are understood to be actually closed communicative spaces formed by bringing together people with similar views (in the broad sense of life, including political life) and emo-tions accompanying these views. Subjects with different views are deliberately not al-lowed into these spaces, their views are discredited and "exposed" by special methods and techniques. Echo chambers are built on the rigid principle of distinguishing "friend" from "foe", exercising rigid epistemic control over the state of minds and forming special structures of countering and exposing the authoritative opinions of opposition representa-tives. Examples of "echo-bubbles" and "echo-chambers" from modern political life (mainly in the USA) are given. The genesis of "echo-bubbles" and "echo-chambers" is associated with the phenomenon of post-truth and the transformation of language, which began to occur around the middle of the 19th century and which consists of an increase in the specific age of emotive components and a tendency to shift interest from collective action to individual activity.

AB In this article we examine the features of the current stage of Russian civil service development through the prism of the basic administrative paradigms - Weberian rational bureaucracy, New Public Management (NPM) and Good Governance; and we identify the prevailing paradigms in scientific discourse, electoral political discourse and modern legal discourse. We use such research methods as follows: content analysis, thesaurus analysis, bibliometric analysis of publications, comparative legal analysis. We propose some criteria for identifying administrative paradigms using a set of thesaurus words, as well as methodological tools for comparing with paradigms: a) scientific articles on state bureaucracy, b) election programs of Russian political parties in terms of reforming the civil service, c) regulatory documents containing the goals of the current stage of the Russian civil service development. As a result of the study, we have found that the Weberian paradigm dominates in scientific publications on law, NPM paradigm - on management and economics, Good Governance paradigm - on sociology and political science, which indicates the multiparadigmality of modern research. During the 2016 and 2021 parliamentary election campaigns, political parties of the entire ideological spectrum worked out a request for social justice, which was due to the predominance of theses in their programs corresponding to Good Governance. Regulation of the Russian civil service development in the period is carried out at the intersection of managerial and Weberian models. The first is manifested in the rigid formalization of the civil servants' activities, and the second - in attempts to make the bureaucracy efficient, compact and complaisant. The preservation of the civil service' closeness is confirmed by a decrease in the share of program measures equivalent to Good Governance, which contradicts the attitude towards openness and justice, fixed in scientific and political discourse.

AB This work is the first attempt to restore the combat path of a common soldier Ivan Ivanovich Cherkasov. He fought on the Northern, Leningrad, 3rd Baltic, and 1st Ukrainian fronts. The work is based on a wide range of archival materials, most of which are introduced into the scholarship for the first time. Documents from the Central Archive of the Ministry of Defense, and the National Archive of the Republic of Karelia, Folklore Archive of the Institute of Language, Literature and History of the Karelian Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences National Archives of the Republic of Karelia, Central State Archives of Historical and Political Documents, Central State Archives of St Petersburg were used in the study. In conclusion, the author states that Ivan Ivanovich Cherkasov in the rank of a common soldier witnessed almost the entire Great Patriotic War - as a shooter in the combat composition of rifle units, in the infantry (the only exception was the period from August to September 1941 when soldier Cherkasov was the commander of a mortar crew). The service in army units was interrupted five times by wounds received in battles, and each time Ivan Ivanovich got back in line. His combat career began in the 2nd Leningrad Division of the People's Militia; then there were the 168th and 128th rifle divisions. He served in the latter from the summer of 1942 to May 1945.

AB There is a growing understanding in social sciences that even purposeful human behavior cannot be fully explained by rational motives. The 'behavioral economy' developed a program for studying economic behavior considering more factors than the blind pursuit of one's benefit. In social psychology, the theory of two groups of factors that influence human behavior has been developed: explicit factors are determined mainly by conceptual thinking, while implicit factors - by non-rational motives, often not obvious for the subject of action. It is argued that the study of both groups of factors is a prerequisite for the correct understanding and accurate prediction of behavior since they are of different nature, irreducible to each other, and have very different effects on behavior. The article focuses on the issue of the different nature of explicit and implicit factors. Can we say that the models of dual decision-making from social psychology are applicable to social action? We tested the nature of the interaction of the explicit and implicit components of the attitude towards the United Russia party with the basic judgments that, it would seem, should form this attitude. The results were paradoxical. It turned out that ideologically biased statements addressed to the political party form an attitude towards it on the implicit level. At the same time, the attitude to these statements depends on the attitude to the party, but at the rational level. Thus, this is a convincing evidence of the fundamentally different nature of explicit and implicit factors of social behavior.

AB Many states have been striving to ensure their universities' presence in the global rankings which reflect not only the significance of universities but also the 'international prestige of the country' [11]. The reason for the popularization of global rankings in Russia was the globalization of the Russian system of higher education. Rankings present universities not only to applicants, students and the academic community, but also to potential employers - by informing about the quality of education, research activities, etc. Another significant parameter of global rankings is the 'information openness' of universities [11]. In addition, universities are fighting not only for applicants but also for additional funding, since education and science have become an element of the economic exchange [5]. The article considers the positions of the Russian higher education institutions in the world rankings in 2022. The relevance of the study is determined by the current trends in the university scientific research and by the political situation. The ranking system is based on the objective assessment by experts from different countries of the significant achievements of universities. Since the scientific research in Russian universities faces difficulties, the authors argue that global rankings have become a controversial means for assessing the competitiveness of Russian universities. The authors describe the dynamics of the positions of Russian universities in world rankings in 2022, the state of national rankings and the difficulties of scientific research based on the statistical and comparative approaches. The results of the study make a certain contribution to the theory of management and can contribute to the successful promotion of Russian scientific achievements and universities in the world community

AB Institutions of the European Union, leading Member States, political elites of the region, who share the approaches of Euro-enthusiasts, put hope on the Conference on the Future of Europe. They expect that it will launch a deep transformation of the EU, give an impetus to its consolidation and deepening of integration, strengthening the international positions and its competitiveness. The Conference on the Future of Europe has absorbed the best that the EU has tried in organizing similar forums. At the same time, it compares favorably with them, since it is built on a network principle using modern information and communication technologies and thereby opens free access to its work. This allows Brussels to assert that the fate of the EU is now determined not by someone else, but by the EU citizens. In addition, it makes it possible to legitimize in advance steps to restructure the European Union, on recommendations that the Conference will prepare. The authors conclude that the pro-European triumvirate of Germany, Italy and France, formed by the beginning of 2022, will not fail in its intentions taking into account the French presidency of the EU Council and the parallel election campaign in the country.

AB The article presents an attempt to study the structural dynam-ics of federal-regional political networks in the process of recruiting heads of the regions. The authors focus their attention on the current stage of the evolu-tion of the federal center's approach towards the formation of the governor's corps, which began with the change of the team in the presidential adminis-tration in the second half of 2016. The theoretical framework of the study is the concepts of patron-client relations and patronal politics. For the empiri-cal testing, the authors employ the apparatus of the Social Network Analysis (SNA), which makes it possible to assess both the political elite itself and the specific influence of individual figures. The conducted research documents a distinct tendency towards the growing structural complexity of the federal-regional patronal network, when an increasing number of federal actors are directly or indirectly involved in the process of recruiting regional leaders, which entails the formation of new intra-elite connections. However, despite the intensive personnel rotation, the tectonic shifts in the structure of patronage are not visible. The backbone of the network remains unchanged and contains on the stable basis a part of the federal political and economic elite, who looks to the leader of the state and enjoys his support. At the same time, the process of the growing complexity of the patronal network is accompanied by an increase in the importance of the President of the Russian Federation, primarily from the point of view of intra-network coordination, which, according to the authors, indicates a rising demand for such coordination in the modern Russia.

LA English
DT Article
DE China; international organizations; discourse; assumptions; Xi Jinping;
   structuring of international relations
AB During its 72-year history, China has followed a difficult path in its efforts to change the diplomatic strategies of its relations with the outside world. The first period, marked by the 30 years from 1949 to 1978, was ideological; it was directed by Mao Zedong and completely ignored international organizations (IOs). The next 30 years (1978-2008) defined a second, economic, period, which was determined by Deng Xiaoping's policy of reforms and opening up, and by the gradual embedding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) into IOs. Now, China is implementing a third, political, stage under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who set the country to the tasksof great power diplomacy and the formation of new/alternative international structures in which it plays a leading role and has a real impact on the future model of the system of international relations.
   The formation of the PRC in 1949 and the Korean War (1950-53) that followed soon after, during which Chinese "volunteer" soldiers fought against the United Nations (UN) forces, blocked the possibility of contact between the PRC and this universal international organization for two decades. The country's internal problems in the form of a "cultural revolution" also did not contribute to the solution of this problem. Even the restoration of the PRC's rights in the UN in 1971, the establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States in 1979, and Deng Xiaoping's reforms could not significantly accelerate the PRC's accession to other international organizations. This process took about 20 more years and, on the whole, ended only in 2001 with China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). In the21st century, especially after the 2008 global financial crisis, China began to actively use existing organizations and to create new ones with partner countries.
   The purpose of this article is to analyze the Chinese academic discourse on the problem of relations between the PRC and international organizations and the international system, in which western countries, headed by the United States, dominate to this day, and in which China does not see a prospect for itself to take a place worthy of its complex power. The history of the formation of relations between the PRC and the international system is examined, the reasons for the dissatisfaction of the PRC with itsstatus in its structures are identified, and the process of creating international organizations in which China occupies a dominant position and, in global competition with the United States, can influence the future model of the world is traced.
   The specific contribution of this article derives from the fact that it mainly uses the works of Chinese authors who study the position of their country in relation to the international system. It is concluded that China is actively formatting its geo-economic space, offering the countries of the Global South, which are part of it, not only material dividends, but also China's values, development model, and vision for a future model of the world

AB The article analyzes the problem of the imperial character of Russia and its future. In the course of the correspondence polemic, the content of the concepts of "civilization" and "empire", the cultural and historical meaning of empires as political forms of the emergence and development of civilizations are analyzed. The idea is refuted that for centuries Russia has lived at the expense of "external receptions", which supposedly predetermined the "imperial nature of the Russian state". Both are wrong. Interpretation of the history of Russia from the perspective of large scale cultural and technological receptions is a sociological simplification of the real interaction of the country with the surrounding world of states of various civilizational affiliation. It was a complex process of mutual influence of domestic political and socio-cultural traditions with samples of foreign forms of life, during which both changed, and quite significantly. Therefore, the history of tsarist, Soviet and present-day Russia cannot be reduced in any way to cultural and socio-political dependency. Modernity has never been unique and homogeneous. One can reason otherwise only from the standpoint of flat progressivism. Criticizing this theoretical attitude, the author proves that Russia's "endless imperialism" does not lead the country into a "historical dead end", but remains its geopolitical advantage.

DE Russian elite; informal network; patron-client relationships; network
   analysis
AB This paper aims to examine the elite structure in Russia. Given the widely recognized dominance of personal relations over formal institutions in the political and economic spheres in Russia, to explore this question, the authors turn to the concept of the informal network and Social Network Analysis (SNA)
   Modelling an informal network requires operationalization of two elements: nodes and edges. The nodes are represented by the individuals who occupied top 50 positions in the "100 Most Influential Politicians of Russia" ranking in March-April, 2020. In contrast to the majority of the researchers who employ network approach to study elites, when deciding on edges (links) of the network, the authors take into account not only politicians' ties that were formed during their previous career steps, but also other sources of their personal connections (outside work), and assess the relevance of the established connections in politicians' biographies.
   The resulting informal network highlights the peculiarities of the organization of the Russian elite, which are quite curious in their multidirectionality. On the one hand, its structure has an obvious center in the person of Vladimir Putin, who is far superior to other players in terms of the number of connections, degree of closeness to all elite actors, and his intermediary role. On the other hand, the level of centralization of the network is rather moderate. The reason is the variety of horizontal ties between the rest of the elite. On the one hand, there are several clearly identifiable communities in the network. On the other hand, there are more connections between such communities than within them. Almost all representatives of law enforcement agencies belong to the same network community. However, there are practically no horizontal ties within the law enforcement network community. In general, the informal network of the Russian elite demonstrates a high level of coherence, with the dominance of complex, multicomponent ties that manifest themselves in different formats of personal relationships. This level of integration can play a significant role in minimizing intra-elite divisions - the "Achilles heel" of authoritarian regimes.

It is based on the research data obtained during ethnic, social, psychological and linguistic monitoring that was conducted in 2007, 2014 and 2021.The consistency of the ethnolinguistic identity of the Sakha youth under the acute influence of external factors (an objective decrease in language competence, deterioration of active skills and improvement of passive ones) has been determined. The communicative strategy is characterized by the substitution of linguistic competence with sociolinguistic competence and accommodation. A significant sociolinguistic characteristic of the youth is the availability of ethnolinguistic resources for the reproduction of their native language. They are in a very inert state due to the transformation of the oncoming generation's values, the degradation of the conditions of bilingualism under the influence of linguistic and political as well as socioeconomic factors, the negative impact of mass digitalization.

AB Introduction. The article examines the Comintern "trace" in the formation of modern "Bolivarian socialism", proclaimed by the leaders of Venezuela at the beginning of the 21st century. Communist postulates (in the Comintern perception) were, certainly, not the only source of the formation of the ideology of the ruling Socialist United Party of Venezuela. At the same time, a number of the postulates were formulated back in the 1920s by activists of the Venezuelan Revolutionary Party (later they became members of the country's Communist Party) and the Socialist Party of Ecuador. A number of similar concepts were the subject of discussions between the leadership of the Comintern and the Peruvian People's Revolutionary Alliance and were also debated during one of the congress of the Communist International. Another important aspect explored by the authors is the analogy between the processes of the formation of a united left party in Venezuela in the 1930s and in the 2000s (as a comparative example, the pattern of creating a united revolutionary party within the framework of the Castro revolution in Cuba was also used). Methods and materials. The study uses a set of methods of analysis adopted in historical and political science, namely documentary analysis, systemic and comparative analysis. Analysis and Results. The cases presented in the article prove that Socialism of the 21st century is not the exclusive creation of Hugo Chavez, but is closely related to ideological discussions in the international left-wing movement of the first half of the 20th century. The article is based primarily on archival documents, which allowed the authors to show little-known pages in the history of Latin American left-wing parties. Authors 'contribution. V.L. Jeifets and L. S. Jeifets made joint analysis of the archival documents, carried out the study of historiography, and developed the theoretical framework of the research.

   cognitive dissonance
AB The relationship between the internal, cognitive-methodological and external, socio-institutional contours of science is characterized by uneven dynamics, misalignment of developmental phases and sometimes significant conflicts. Within the internal contour, this dissonance acts, in particular, as a distinction between tasks and problems. At the level of the external contour, this corresponds to the confrontation between the normal scientific community and the marginal precaria. The article puts forward a hypothesis about the source of both acceleration and inhibition of scientific research and acceptance by society of their results. It is seen, on the one hand, in the cognitive problematization of existing knowledge. The problem, unlike the problem, embodies the projective-constructive dimension of knowledge; it is a way of setting a possible future, a manifestation of creative freedom. On the other hand, the dynamics of science is determined by the competition of the institute of normal science and its social alternatives. At the same time, normal science is interpreted not just as the solution of particular problems, "solving puzzles" (T. Kuhn). It includes the socio-institutional dimension: the "normal" distribution of roles and statuses in the scientific community; tenure's dominance over short-term projects and contracts, basic funding of universities and institutes before grants, scientific schools over temporary research groups. As a symbol of social alternatives to normal science is the scientific precariat. This is a group that is often identified with the marginalized, but in fact includes the social diversity of scientists who do not have tenure. In addition, in the vast majority of countries, scientists are forced to look for a part-time job in order to ensure a decent standard of living, which introduces them to the situation of precaria in the economic and sociological sense. At the same time, this contributes to the expansion of their horizons, ideological emancipation, mobility, readiness to solve both fundamental problems and applied problems, to be involved in the work of interdisciplinary research groups and social projects. Both the cognitive and social problematization of science contribute to scientific creativity and its external manifestation - the development of a free society. Such a perspective is initially given to science and society by the philosophical utopia of knowledge-as-power, which, under the guise of domination over minds, proclaims the desire for freedom.

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to the analysis of the process of formation of the digital elite, determines the legitimacy and regularity of its appearance as a new stratum of the global information society. The paper shows that the study of the process of formation of the digital elite, and the strengthening of its power components is relevant and at the same time complex, with no unambiguous judgments in modern political science. It requires increased attention of the Russian state to the problems of information security and the protection of information sovereignty. Methods and materials. When preparing the article, the author relied on the concept of the global information society, as well as a systematic analysis of the digital society and its strata as a single, complexly organized organism. The methods of comparative analysis, structural and institutional approach and scientific forecasting were used. Analysis. The author examines the general trends of the genesis of the global digital society, the current stage of human development, determines the essence and main features of the new emerging social stratum of this society - the transnational digital elite, its significance and influence on the development of world and Russian society. The article substantiates the thesis that through the digital management of society and the economy, transnational elites have the potential to establish global world governance in the long term. However, according to the author, such a prospect is not deterministic, but is only one of the options for the future development of mankind The paper also reveals some features of the modern Russian digital transformation, examines the possibilities of the emergence of the Russian digital elite. Results. According to the results of the study, it is concluded that the formation of the digital elite occurs as a result of the gradual transformation of the ruling national and transnational elites, their transition to digital management technologies.

DE India; Russia; Indo-Pacific; Cold War; Foreign Policy Discourse; China;
   USA
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the contemporary state and prospects of India-Russia relations. There is a disagreement between scientists and politicians: the former believe that relations are stagnating, the latter that they are developing successfully. The author examines the Indian way of conducting foreign policy through the prism of methodological problems: he notes that decision-making on external relations is the prerogative of the prime minister. A distinctive feature of India's foreign policy is its continuity, but the ongoing process of elite erosion is putting it at risk. Nevertheless, at this stage, India's foreign policy is characterized by certain imperatives. The author identifies three main reasons for the deterioration of Russian-Indian relations: changes in the economic and international situation and problems in the formation of the political discourse. The second factor is the most decisive. The Soviet system of training orientalists failed to adapt to new realities. A similar situation, albeit for different reasons, has developed in India. As a result, a kind of "discursive blindness" has emerged, in which the political elites of both countries do not understand the benefits of expanding relations with each other, and the expert community has too little weight to ensure this process on its own. A typical example is the attitude to the concept of the Indo-Pacific Region. The new Cold War between the United States and China may aggravate this problem. But the author believes that the correct strategy, including the gradual development of economic ties, the development of its own Indo-Pacific strategy and support for domestic Indology, could help to solve it in the end.

AB The article describes the integration processes that developed in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the 2000s, which culminated in the formation of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The purpose of the article is to determine the main directions of the EAEU development through the prism of country preferences of the participants of this integration association: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. The specifics of the involvement of these countries in the Eurasian integration processes in the CIS help to understand better the scale of the EAEU's activities, its specifics, which is important for determining both the prospects for the development of the EAEU and the country dimension of Eurasian integration. The formation of the EAEU was preceded by the formation of the Customs Union (CU) and the Common Economic Space (CES), which generally corresponded to the algorithm that was present in world practice when creating large integration associations. The locomotives of the Eurasian integration process were initially Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus, which demonstrated the highest level of economic and political interaction in the CIS. In conclusion, the main prospects for the country development of the EAEU and Eurasian integration in general are shown. The EAEU promises certain benefits to the states that are part of such an association. In addition, there is a certain political context here - as a result of closer integration, the EAEU states will become less susceptible to crises and the emergence of conflict situations. Like any integration association, the EAEU faces many problems and challenges, both external and internal. It is not always possible to overcome them completely, but the countries-members of the Union are making significant efforts to this, which in the future should give positive results in strengthening this integration project in Eurasia.

DE public discourse; media space; hybridisation; mass media; information;
   communication; cognition; knowledge; society; social reality
AB The scope of the studies of mass-media and public discourse transformation processes is vast and multi-faceted, and requires some coordinated interdisciplinary approaches. Meanwhile the current stage of scientific comprehension of the above mentioned topic (from the beginning of the 21st century) may be designated as preliminary and a sort of "reconnaissance" within the "territory" of the modern media space and also an observation of all the diverse processes that are found within it. As a result of such observation, the phenomenon of public discourse hybridisation has been identified as comprising a mixture of cultural, genre, style and language features and characterised by blurring of the boundaries between elitist and mass cultures. This phenomenon is, first of all, based on information and technology development of post-industrial societies, namely, the World Wide Web (Internet) and mass computerisation (especially the fact of mass owning of mobile digital gadgets - smartphones, laptops, etc.). Modern media space public discourse, seen as a hybrid communicative phenomena despite its ultimate openness and flexibility or rather due to them, leads to situations where the risk of loosing initial meaning of transferred messages and also recipient's attention is very high. That also may result in failure of certain communication attempts since the cooperative principles of communication are involuntarily violated. Additionally, the growing lack of trust in received information and the rise of social tension and protesting behaviours are observed as a negative reflection of hybrid public discourse. There is already some scientific evidence of these as caused by the destructive influence of information overload ("info-crisis") on human cognition. It is of the main interest under the circumstances to find ways to raise people's tolerance to information overload and, which seems to be even more important, to educate in them a rational and critical attitude towards any information and to make the learning and knowledge-acquiring processes more effective in general. The social significance of mass-media and public discourse is well recognised and foregrounds the task of conceptualisation and comprehensive studies of their influence on human cognition and world outlook of both reciprocating authors and audience, and also of the need of knowledge, beliefs and prejudices demarcation as well as the results of propaganda, ideology and information noise on information consumers. It seems important in the context of cultural and technological specifics of modern society to introduce the concept " adaptive social knowledge" - the type of knowledge that takes into account all the cultural and axiological features of the period of time studied and can provide both individuals and societies with tools for an optimum adaptation to the current environment changes and civilisation progress.

AB The article provides a critical analysis and synthesis of modern concepts of social well-being, as well as decomposition and operationalization of this sociological concept, which allows solving the problem of measuring and assessing the quality of life of individuals and social groups in a more comprehensive way. We have shown differences in the understanding of social well-being as a socio-psychological construct based on an individual's subjective evaluation of the conditions and results of their life activities, and as an objective assessment of the social and economic status of the individual, their involvement in social networks, access to public goods. We also noted that when choosing a methodology for measuring social well-being, it is necessary to consider the economy of the society under consideration (developed or developing) and the existence conditions of the local community as a whole, not just individuals (the concept of community well-being). Based on a synthesis of existing approaches, methodologies, and sets of variables for the empirical study of social well-being, we propose our own version of the methodology for the comprehensive measurement of social well-being, which takes into account the specifics of social processes and relations in contemporary Russia. Within the framework of this methodology, we identify 11 basic factors affecting the level of social well-being, operationalized through more than 50 indicators. The sources of data for their measurement, along with state and corporate statistics, are mass sample and expert surveys. In the article we also raise the problem of calculating weighting coefficients for various factors contributing to social well-being, and proposed its solution on the basis of the ranking method as a special case of the expert evaluation method. The considered set of factors allows covering economic, social, political and legal, medical, socio-cultural and everyday components of life of individuals and local communities.

AB The value and institutional core, which legitimized the historical rise and global domination of the West, is increasingly becoming the object of criticism. The initial coordinates of the liberal consensus, which promised humanity a constant rise in the living standards and opportunities thanks to the universality of the models of self-regulating markets and liberal democracies, find themselves under a revision. The background global trends, including those that unfolded in the Western societies, demonstrate the opposite - stagnation or shrinking of the resource base of the majority of the population against the background of the radicalization of economic inequality, corporate game that includes "shorting" the cost of labor (global uberization), the formation of elite democracies with limited access that ignore the principles of equality and interests of the majority. As a result, values, practices and institutions that were previously viewed as pathological deviations, institutional traps and something archaic (backwardness), consistently transform into a new global normality. Thus, theories that describe the contours of the global future mainly in non-market, and sometimes in illiberal categories, are gaining momentum. These theories document new formats for the distribution of public resources, which are not based on markets and democracy, but rather on rent mechanisms, redistributive political regulation and differentiated value for the state of different social groups.
   The authors argue that, from the economic standpoint, the emerging new normality is associated with the unfolding consensus that citizens are entitled to the basic political rent or other forms of differentiated access to resources that can provide them with decent existence in the face of the growing inefficiency of market communications. From the political standpoint, the new normality manifests itself in the potential communitarian turn, based on a set of left-wing, nationalist and populist discourses, united by the resentment idea of returning to the state (which distributes resources) a key role in regulating radical inequalities in the interests of the majority.

AB This article is devoted to the political science analysis of the international climate regime, Russia's position regarding the implementation of its principles and the EU climate regime. Today, the problem of climate change is fundamental to any society. At the global level, there is an established system of governance under the auspices of the UN, as well as a "green consensus" contending that an increase in the average temperature on Earth is a threat to humankind. The theory of international regimes suggests the existence of an international climate regime, a system of intergovernmental institutions to combat climate change with the UN playing a dominant role (while the participants form a certain common understanding and consensus, and thereby take binding obligations that restrict their actions by established norms and rules). The global consensus is expressed in the implementation of national practices and the development of national approaches. We show that despite the presence of common environmental values, their implementation at the national level occurs in different ways. The Russian approach focuses on adapting to the effects of climate change and finding tools to reduce emissions (by absorbing them, and not only by actually reducing them). This approach is referred to as a loss reduction and benefits reaping strategy. The European Union, already positioning itself as a global environmental leader, is launching a "green perestroika" and opting for a decarbonisation paradigm. This existence of paradigmally different approaches at meso-levels is blurring the system of global environmental governance and leading to its fragmentation. Ultimately, this creates new dividing lines, including ate political and ideological levels. In the medium term, this could contribute to increasing tensions in international relations and world politics.

AB Subnational appointments may improve the cohesion of the elites and regime sustainability since the tenure of appointed heads directly depends on the upper-level administration, unlike the more independent directly elected subordinates. In this regard, most Russian regional authorities, who were able to independently determine the design of executive power at the local level after the reform in 2014-2015, now aim to replace direct elections of municipal heads with appointments. However, the abolition of direct mayoral elections is not always possible or beneficial for the regional authorities. Based on interviews, I compare the municipalities of the Amur Region and the Republic of Buryatia and show that replacing elections with appointments depends on the loyalty of the municipal legislature, which is ensured through the mandates of the United Russia party. Appointments can be used in two cases: to prolong the political survival of a loyal incumbent who has lost the ability or opportunity to be re-elected, or to liquidate a disloyal mayor As an exception, direct elections are retained in those territories where mayors have strong political machines if they serve the interests of the regional administration. Opposition municipal legislatures are blocking the cancellation of mayoral elections because, informally, appointments do not allow opposition parties to recruit candidates. It is also easier for the regional administration to support the electoral model because it makes the may or independent of the opposition legislature, and allows the regional authorities to co-opt the mayor's resources into the power vertical.

DE cynicism; meta-epistemology; Peter Sloterdijk; subject; truth
AB This article continues the author's attempts to explore the phenomenon of modern cynicism from an epistemological standpoint. The author has already published an article on cognitive strategies of a postmodern subject against the background of the unfolding cynical attitude of consciousness [Tomsk State University Journal of Philosophy, Sociology and Political Science. 2022. Vol. 67. P. 27-35]. The object of research in this article is the concept "diffuse cynicism" by Peter Sloterdijk, which in the first part of the work is reconstructed as epistemological. In the course of this reconstruction, the author reveals a number of epistemic difficulties that lead to an internal contradiction within the framework of the theory and the impossibility of its further reconstruction without solving these difficulties. The author points out the nature of these difficulties, demonstrates that such epistemic difficulties are not unique to the concept analyzed and extend to epistemological theories in general. In particular, the question arises about the legality of Sloterdijk's normative judgments in relation to the subject, while being a subject, and, therefore, falling under their own normative descriptions. To solve this difficulty, the author turns to the possibility of identifying subjects of different epistemological status. She demonstrates that it is possible to detect and identify such subjects using meta-epistemological analysis. A brief analysis of the main features of such an analysis is proposed. The second part of the article presents a meta-analysis of Sloterdijk's concept. The author proposes to distinguish between subjects of different status, referring, firstly, to the motives underlying the nomination of epistemological judgments by subjects and, secondly, to the assessment of specific statements of the subject in a particular situation from the standpoint of the pragmatic, semantic and practical status of these statements. Using the example of the meta-analysis of Sloterdijk's concept "diffuse cynicism", the author shows the relevance and importance of meta-epistemology for epistemological theories.

AB The article analyzes Russian millennials' perceptions of their generation. Despite the correspondence of Russian millennials to the general characteristics described in the foreign academic discussion, the article notes that the experience of the Russian millennial generation differs from the global one, as for the most part it includes the national historical and cultural context. The theoretical aspects of the article are based both on classical approaches to generational studies and on contemporary debates about how individuals habituate global and national experiences during their formative years. Based on Korsten's discursive approach, the paper examines the narratives of three age cohorts of St. Petersburg residents. The analysis of the empirical material revealed a discourse on the transitional nature of the generation, conceptualized by informants within the technology, political structure, and socio-economic well-being of Russia during their formative years.

AB Introduction. The relevance of the study is associated with the need for scientific understanding of youth volunteering, deepening ideas about its educational potential, which is realised in the education system. In the context of international and national studies, it is important to evaluate the volunteer participation of the younger generation, its social effects on society. The social effectiveness of volunteering is a necessary condition, the result of educational activities organised in the educational environment. The study meets the practical request to determine the conditions for changing the qualitative characteristics of students volunteering with an active agenda of state assistance to the pro-social activity of the youth in the Russian Federation. Understanding the motivation, intentions and real opportunities for volunteer participation of high school students and students is important for improving the effectiveness of solving the task of increasing the social activity of young people, defined in the framework of the state youth policy.
   Aim. The article aimed to concretise the social significance of the volunteer participation of high school students and students and to determine the conditions for overcoming the motivated refusal of youth volunteering in the educational environment in order to increase the effectiveness of its organisation.
   Methodology and research methods. The methodological basis of the article is a set of theoretical ideas about the formation of social solidarity and stimulation of pro-social behaviour of young people. The theory of social participation has received a certain development in the article. The article is based on the materials of the authors' research projects implemented in 2017-2020 in the Sverdlovsk region. Having used the questionnaire method, the authors analysed the data of a mass survey of young people in the Sverdlovsk region from 14 to 24 years old from 81 settlements of the region. A representative sample consisted of 1105 people, the error is no more than 3,5%. The sample was based on four quotas: gender, age, the main type of employment (school, college, and university) and type of city by population.
   Results and scientific novelty. The study showed that while maintaining a large number of students with experience in volunteering, the number of those, who consciously refuse or doubt that they will be engaged in volunteering in their future, increases. In recent years, the number of those, who have gained volunteering experience through initiatives in educational institutions, has increased significantly. The involvement of young Uralians in social projects has decreased. The study proves that the voluntary activity of young people is a necessary condition for the accumulation of social capital in territorial communities. The involvement of schoolchildren and students in youth organisations, in socio-cultural urban life is an important and necessary condition for effective volunteer participation of young people. It was revealed that volunteer experience is directly related to student interest in public life. It is proved that high school students and students with volunteer experience and intentions to continue it are more likely to be involved in the social and political life of their city or village than those who do not have such experience.
   Practical significance. In schools, colleges and universities, there is an important task of organising not only the educational process, but also educational activities. When requesting mass youth participation and the typicality of socially significant events, it is important to understand the conditions when the qualitative characteristics of volunteering by young citizens as members of the local community are being developed.

AB The article discusses the epistemological functions of expertise in modern science and substan-tiates the thesis that the emergence of expert knowledge is associated with the transformations of science (its technization, digitalization and application) and the anthropological crisis of the 20th-21st centuries. The authors believe that due to expert assessments, the target settings that are present in specific scientific research programs are explicated - both cognitive ones and focused primarily on solving various kinds of socially significant practical problems. Thus, the examination, in fact, opens up opportunities for clarifying the most effective ratio of fundamen-tal and applied research settings in a particular cognitive activity. The authors demonstrate that expert activity allows scientists to consciously (with appeals to the semantic content of specific research projects) and, thus, more adequately (taking into account applied problems) assess the epistemological prospects of certain areas of research and thereby contribute to the expansion of the scope of scientific knowledge, development science as a cultural and historical phenom-enon. To concretize the reasoning, the authors focus on how the implementation of the cognitive functions of expertise in science takes place and appeal to the legal precedent (the Kass vs. Kass process), which has become one of the models for resolving disputes in the field of biomedical research of objects with an unstable subject, ethical and legal status (cryopreserved embryos). Particular attention is paid to the fundamental predictive functions of expert knowledge, which has dignity, i. e. taking into account socio-political and existential-humanitarian restrictions, on the one hand, and contributing to the expansion of the scientific horizon, on the other

AB The article gives a high assessment to the collection of articles by the American historian G. Freeze, which is completely devoted to various issues of church-state relations in the last decades of the existence of the Russian Empire during the Civil War. The purpose of the article is to critically analyze the works of G. Freeze and, on the basis of the concepts proposed by him, try to characterize the role of the Orthodox clergy in the events of the Russian Revolution and fratricidal confrontation. The huge contribution of G. Freeze to the study of this issue is noted. In fact, the American professor became a pioneer in working with archival documents on Russian church history of the synodal period, and his views on the history of the Russian Orthodox Church became a noticeable phenomenon in historiography. It is noted that G. Freeze acted as a kind of revisionist of the concept of the Church as a "servant of the monarchy", which was fundamental for Russian historical science in the first decades of Soviet power, and was also actively used in the works of R. Pipes. G. Freeze in his articles consistently defends the thesis of the independence of the Church, of its special place in the imperial structure, which has allowed for a certain independence in defending its positions. This is proved, among other things, by the examples of several canonizations of saints during the reign of Nicholas II, when the will of the secular authorities not only caused a heated public discussion, but also met with sharp opposition in hierarchal circles. The review examines and analyzes the changes that took place within the Church and influenced its position in relations with the central government and with other classes of Russian society. It is shown that the crisis of church life manifested itself especially sharply in the first years after the collapse of the monarchy in Russia. This, in particular, manifested itself in open speeches by ordinary clergy against bishops, in the democratization of parish life, and in discussions about the participation of the clergy in divorce proceedings. The ideas expressed in G. Freeze's articles are compared with data taken from the works of leading experts in the history of the Church and social and political life (N.N. Smirnov, S.L. Firsov etc.). The main conclusion that the researcher comes to can be formulated as follows: due to the peculiarities of the policy of the Russian monarchy in relation to the Church and the clergy, and also due to complex processes directly in the spiritual environment, by 1917 the clergy were no longer a political ally of the monarchical forces, and therefore in some cases welcomed the revolution. The change in the political system in Russia to a large extent contributed to drastic changes in parish life, in particular, to the weakening of the power of bishops in the regions.

TI CONTRADICTIONS OF JUDICIAL CRIMINAL POLICY
SO PRAVOPRIMENENIE-LAW ENFORCEMENT REVIEW
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Criminal policy; judicial policy; law enforcement; contradictions of
   criminal policy; resolution of contradictions of criminal policy
AB The subject of the study is the criminal policy in the context of contradictions in the functioning of the courts.
   The purpose of the study is to investigate, which contradictions of criminal policy are generated by a multi-level system of courts, and which mechanisms for overcoming them in order to optimize criminal policy could be found out.
   The methodology. In modern conditions of diversification of methodological approaches to organizing and conducting political-legal research, it is important not to discard, but to rethink and rediscover the epistemological possibilities of the methods of classical science, especially the method of dialectical analysis.
   The main results and scope of the study. The use of the category "dialectical contradiction" for the purpose of studying the problems of the functioning of the courts in terms of the interpretation and application of criminal law provisions opens up new possibilities in the study of criminal and judicial policy, as well as determining the prospects for its development. In the study, the law enforcement contradictions of criminal policy refer to the relations between courts of various types and levels that develop in the course of their functioning and reflect the opposite approaches of law enforcement bodies to the interpretation and application of criminal legislation. Considering the level and type of legal proceedings, these contradictions can be summarized in the following groups: (a) between national and international courts; (b) between superior courts of the national legal system; (c) between the courts of various instances of the system of courts of general jurisdiction.
   The contradictions between national and international courts, emerging in the field of protection of human rights and freedoms, are an objective source of development of judicial practice and policy. The resolution of these contradictions is based on the consensus of various courts and compromise. If the position of the European Court of Human Rights does not contradict the provisions of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the state adjusts its legal practice in the direction set by the authoritative international instance by means of: (a) direct application of national legislation with due regard for the ECHR's legal positions; (b) the application of national legislation in its constitutional interpretation by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, which does not differ from the decisions and positions of the ECHR; (c) amending national legal acts in pursuance of ECHR judgments. In exceptional cases, when the position of the European Court touches upon issues of the country's constitutional identity, the contradiction between the international and national legal order is resolved by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation on the basis of the priority of constitutional norms.
   At the level of the superior national courts the contradictions are represented by the differing positions of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on the assessment and interpretation of criminal law provisions. Such contradictions can be thought of as latent until they are not revealed in constitutional proceedings. The identification and resolution of these contradictions is the most important direction of legal policy in the country; it reflects the consistent solution of the aim of constitutionalization of the criminal law.
   At the level of the system of courts of general jurisdiction, the concept of "contradiction" can only be applied to those differing approaches of the courts to solving criminal cases that do not go beyond the rule of law. Contradictions arise only when, having correctly established the factual circumstances of the case, the courts disagree in the choice of the legal provision to be applied, although any such choice can be explained and motivated. These contradictions may or may not be related to the quality of criminal legislation. Therefore, the mechanism for their resolution includes not only law revision. It is important to use the capabilities of the judicial system itself to develop a consensual understanding of the textual content of the criminal law and the rules for its application.
   Conclusions. Overcoming the contradictions of the judicial criminal policy is possible only in the process of communication and dialogue between the courts of different levels on the basis of differentiation of jurisdiction, respect for authority and independence.

AB This article discusses the issues related to the transformation of structural elements in a social system. It demonstrates that any transformation is systemic. The study proves that the above-mentioned transformations are caused by changes in the basic principles of social institutions. Social systems are characterized by self-organization and often supplemented by external management. The idea of permanent transformations in various institutions in the nonlinear world is realized in the fact that specific institutions should correspond to the actual needs of society and its members. At the same time, the priority is to achieve a cumulative effect using social resources in such a way that the intellectual potential of both the entire group and each individual is fully manifested.

AB Traditionally, when studying the campaign of the Orenburg military governor V.A. Perovsky to Khiva in 1839-1840, among the motives that prompted the Russian authorities to sanction this approach, researchers primarily noted economic interests and the desire to end the raids of Khivans on Russian caravans. At the same time, the international context of this campaign which coincided with the first Anglo-Afghan war was pushed into the background. The purpose of this article written within the framework of a systematic approach to the study of international relations is to prove the correlation between the actions of the Russian and British authorities in Central Asia at the turn of the 1830s and 1840s. Studying the logic of the events preceding the Khiva campaign of V.A. Perovsky and referring to documents directly related to the preparation of this campaign allow us to conclude that the concern of a number of Russian political figures (among whom V.A. Perovsky was) with the activation of British agents in Central Asia and the actions of the British army in Afghanistan was one of the main motives for organizing the campaign, the purpose of which was to strengthen Russian positions in the named region. Despite the failure of V.A. Perovsky's idea, the authorities of British India, frightened by the movement of Russian troops and suffering defeats in Afghanistan, contributed to the settlement of contradictions between Russia and Khiva in order to preserve the regional status quo. The actions of the British side, as well as the insufficient interest of the Russian authorities in the Central Asian direction in comparison with the European and Middle Eastern ones, contributed to a decrease in Russia's activity in Central Asia after the unsuccessful campaign of V.A. Perovsky.

ID DISCOURSE
AB Introduction. In the Russian Federation, the relevance of research on the demographic indicators and the effectiveness of public administration in their regulation. Demographic problems include a set of tasks that need to be solved to ensure the growth of fertility and life expectancy, reduce mortality, and regulate migration. This study discusses a part of demographic policy, namely the instruments of the state family and demographic policy aimed at "saving the people of Russia and developing human potential", which, in accordance with the National Security Strategy of the Russian Federation, are the priority of the country's national interest. The purpose of this work is to identify the context of communication between the government and society in the process of covering the demographic situation and public administration in the field of family and demographic policy by the Russian media. Methods and Materials. The research methodology is based on theories that reveal the relationship between political management and political communication (S. Ball-Rokeach and M. DeFleur, G. Lasswell, J. Habermas, G. Esping Andersen, S. Volodenkov, M. Grachev, A. Solovyov, etc.). The research method is content analysis of regional Russian media, the sample consists of 9011 articles. Analysis. In the process of content analysis, the following tools of public administration were evaluated: communication and the construction of a discourse on the implementation and results of family and demographic policy in the Russian media. Family and demographic policy are parts of social policy and can be quite effective (for example, the "One-child policy" of China), but the use of technologies to manipulate public opinion in the process of implementing family and demographic policy carries significant risks. Results. The content analysis revealed how family and demographic policy is covered in the media, which of the three communication purposes of the authorities and society (information, dialogue or manipulation) is the basic one. Content analysis allowed us to answer the question: are technologies of manipulation of public opinion used to increase the birth rate in the Russian Federation? It is revealed that these technologies are not used in the analyzed media, there is no persistent repetition of characteristic phrases. The data obtained in the process of content analysis made it possible to describe the communicative practices used in the studied media, to conclude whether the communicative practices correspond to the goals of political management in the field of family and demographic policy. Authors' contribution. T. Rostovskaya built a theoretical scheme for the study of the context of communication between the government and society, carried out a guide for collecting material by regions of the Russian Federation. E. Vasilieva developed a research methodology, processed the data obtained. The co-authors jointly analyzed the data and interpreted the results.

TI To the Question of the Philosophical Interpretation of Pushkin's The
   Prophet: The Jansenist Bible of Port-Royal and the Poet's "Prophetic
   Transformation"
SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Pushkin; philosophical foundations of " The Prophet"; the Bible of
   Port-Royal; Jansenism; Pascal; "reformation" of man; poet's mission
AB The author assumes that the strategy of the ideologues and translators of the Bible of Port- Royal, based on the powerful linguistic-logical, philosophicaltheological and methodological basis of "The Grammar" and "The Logic" of Port-Royal, was in many respects to convey latently to the reader, in what they believed to be a correct and adequate interpretation of the Vulgate, key aspects of the theological and philosophical ideology of Jansenism (going back to Aurelius Augustine). So, the reader, even completely alien to Jansenism, could at times unconsciously absorb elements of this doctrine without even realising it. By way of a philosophical analysis of the poem "The Prophet", the author seeks to bring to light not only some aspects of Pushkin's perception of the Bible of Port-Royal, which he started actively reading in 1825, but also elements of Jansenism ideology (including the "reformation of the inner man"). The poet may also have become acquainted with some of the doctrines of this teaching through the writings of the Jansenist Pascal. The author also sees in Pushkin's "Prophet" an implicit parallel to Augustine's doctrine of the world as a "hierarchy" of God's creations. The mystical-allegorical description of his "reformation"/"transformation" is consistently correlated by the poet with the Biblical prophetic symbolism of the heavenly fire (in which one can see a parallel to Pascal's "Memorial"). The article also reveals the soteriological aspect of the global humanitarian mission of the poet-"prophet". Assuming an implicit influence of Jansenism through the Bible of Port-Royal (and an explicit one through the writings of Pascal) might throw new light on the identification of the creative origins and the transformation of the outlook of other Russian writers of the first half to the middle of the 19th century, as well as on the development of Russian intellectual and political thought (e.g., that of Emperor Alexander I) during this period.

AB In the first quarter of the 21st century, the leading role of mass media (press, radio, and TV) in agenda setting was challenged by alternative and citizen digital journalism. As a result, the conceptual framework of the agenda-setting construct has changed. Social media and online influencers contributed to the development of a digital, namely hybrid, socio-political agenda. The article deals with the features of alternative social media and reveals the differences between alternative media and mainstream media; defines the notion of "digital socio-political agenda"; substantiates the role of influencers in shaping digital socio-political agenda; and reveals the influence of the digital socio-political agenda on the behavioral patterns of real-life citizen socio-political participation. The article presents a novel theoretical model of the digital socio-political agenda developed by the authors, which was designed to explain the functioning of a multidimensional and multilayered network. The digital socio-political agenda model has two dimensions: the "Official discourse" (networked data retrieved from the sites of mainstream and pro-government media, governmental bodies, political parties) and the "Network discourse" (networked data retrieved from social media and used to construct the network of "Users", "Messages", "Hashtags", and "Emoji"). These dimensions are in constant interaction, which gives rise to a new digital socio-political agenda, in which the state loses its leadership role.

AB The text is the first in a series of articles about the image of the Russian future, which was formed in Russian mass consciousness in 2021-2022 and considers a 10-year horizon for its evolution. Using the psychographic method in focus groups across the country, the authors try to answer the question: "How do Russian citizens see their future?" The respondents are divided into three age groups: 18-30 years old, 31-55, 56+. Researchers present a study of 36 focus groups conducted in 18 localities of 14 Russian regions (from Moscow to Kamchatka). Despite the focus on the perception of the future, actual problems faced by Russians are also described, and compared with the data of the leading sociological centers. Based on the analysis of drawings and transcripts of the focus groups, the researchers highlight 6 large contradictions (splits) inside Russian society, which could provoke a large-scale socio-political crisis in the long term. The first article of the cycle describes in detail the tendencies of unconditional paternalism, the low level of personal responsibility of citizens, the deep inequality of Russian regions, and the mutual alienation of the authorities from society.

AB The high deliberative quality of political conversation among citizens is a valuable component when taking political decisions. However, online discussions often do not correspond to deliberative standards which can be found in the theory of deliberative democracy. In this paper, argumentation (reasoning) and communicative culture (civility and incivility) as the most relevant parameters of deliberation are analyzed in order to assess the quality of Russian and American social networks' deliberation. The research is based on a methodology of discourse analysis which allows to identify the deliberative quality of political discourse. The article presents the results of online discussions' analysis on significant issues in the Russian and American socio-political discourses - the court verdict of Alexei Navalny and the second impeachment of Donald Trump. As an empirical basis of study, online discussions on the pages of Vkontakte social network of four Russian media and discussions of four American media on Facebook are used. The authors conclude that social media deliberation as a form of public dialogue in Russia is poorly developed in terms of argumentation and culture of speech while American online deliberation is more developed, reasoned, polite and respectful.

AB The article deals with the epistolary controversy between the theologian E. Peterson and the jurist C. Schmitt about the possibility of Schmitt's 1922 concept of "political theology" pointing out that modern political (state-legal) concepts are based on theological concepts. The answer to his text was a number of publications by E. Peterson who argued that the concept of political theology is untenable in relation to Christianity because it is impossible to establish a direct analogy between Trinitarian dogma and political reality, and because of the eschatological nature of the Christian faith which detracts from the significance of secular forces. According to Peterson, the concept of political theology can only make sense for Judaism and paganism. Almost forty years later, Schmitt devoted a separate work to the presentation of his counterarguments designed to show the logical and historical limitations of of Peterson's proofs. Among other things, it was due to his desire to preserve the purity of Christian theology, which is exclusively dogmatic in nature. According to Schmitt, Peterson's extremely refined view of Christian theology lead him to ignore specific historical circumstances associated with cardinal changes in the relationship between the Church and the State, leading to an incorrect understanding of political theology. The argument of Schmitt is based on the thesis of the totality of the political, which revolves around the decision about enemies and friends. The latter is reflected in Peterson's works in the form of a theological decision that establishes the difference between the heretic and the orthodox. The border between the heretic and the orthodox retains its dogmatic character only if political neutralization is carried out, but becomes politically motivated (with a division into friends and enemies) when the struggle between the positions reaches the maximum degree of intensity, and turns into an existential confrontation.

AB Introduction. The Trump administration defined China and Russia as a "revisionist powers", which challenge to American power, influence and interests. Such a perception affected the U.S. policy in Latin America. Major alarmist sentiments come from the U.S. military, which regularly notes the growth of foreign presence in the region. Methods and materials. The author conducted a critical analysis of Chinese and Russian footprint aspects in Latin America, which cause U.S. establishment concerns. Information was gathered from doctrinal documents, economic statistics and indicators of arms exports. Analysis President Trump administration hasn't created a credible barrier against the rise of foreign influence in this region. The causes lie in the specifics of the current U.S. foreign policy, which lacks positive incentives and representativeness. As a result, foreign influence is constrained by three main factors. First, the investment climate in Latin America continues to deteriorate. Second, most governments of the Latin American countries don't intend to spoil relations with the United States. Thirdly, today there are no alternatives to the United States in the military-strategic aspect. Results. Washington involuntarily promotes expanding and strengthening of other world powers' footprint in Latin America. It happens not just because of Trump administrations' protectionism and its skepticism about multilateral formats. Latin American continue to be considered in the context of Monroe Doctrine. American establishment doesn't seek to invest its political capital in expanding the U.S. influence in the region. That's why a high level of representativeness in promoting initiatives and new formats of cooperation has become an advantage of foreign actors.

AB The interaction between the USSR and the US during the Cold War was not always of a pronounced confrontational nature. In the early 1970s, the turn from confrontation to detente seemed sensational, but its very possibility was the result of a long evolution of bilateral US-Soviet relations and the system of international relations as such. This article discusses the reasons that prompted the US leadership to expand scientific and research and technology contacts with the Soviet Union in the late 1960s - early 1970s, clarifies the place of scientific and research and technology issues in constructing the US strategy towards the USSR at the beginning of the detente. Although these issues are outlined in the works of some Russian and international authors on Cold War history, no special studies on this problem have appeared so far. The conclusion argues that detente did not mean the US leadership's rejection of the Cold War, it only temporarily shifted its focus from the arms race and nuclear potentials to the areas where the advantages of the US were more pronounced at the time - to compare living standards, the degree of openness of societies and the quality of the consumer market. The complex of bilateral treaties of 1972-1974 determined the direction and parameters of competitive interaction of the powers in these areas but did not guarantee the convergence and interpenetration of socio-political systems.

AB The article examines the outcomes of a sociologic survey of the population of the Republic of Dagestan held in 2020 in order to investigate how people assessed the socio-economic situation in the region during the pandemic. A special focus was made on the opinions expressed by the members of the region's leading ethnic groups. We have summed up the opinions on the economic situation both individuals and families saw themselves in, as well as what respondents thought on how to reach economic success, get a job, provide decent healthcare - and also how life felt from specifically ethnic viewpoints. Members of a number of ethnicities reflected on the current social and economic problems, on the opportunities and conditions of using native languages in communication, education, healthcare, as well as on ethnic self-consciousness and ethnic identification in times of crisis.
   Not all ethnicities shared identical feelings in this situations. Avars, Dargins and Kumyks, who had been relatively dominating in social, economic and political spheres before the pandemic, saw little change. On the contrary, smaller ethnic communities, such as Russians or Azerbaijanis, saw their economic conditions worsen, especially in employment, getting a new job in their professional field or in accordance with their specialization. This led to decreased welfare and worsened social status.
   The people of the region saw the overall socioeconomic situation as a little worse than satisfactory. While 1/10 of the population are convinced that they live better than their counterparts in other regions of Russia, and 1/5, on the contrary, believe that their welfare is worse than the federal average, the overwhelming majority of 70% see no difference between living standards in Dagestan and Russia's other constituent regions.

AB The article analyses the neighbourhood effect in the voting behaviour of the Latvians at the four recent parliamentary elections, the ethnic and national leaning of parties considered. The study expands a set of electoral geography tools by adding modern techniques of spatial analysis as well as by increasing the knowledge on the position of the Russian speakers within Latvia's political party landscape. The research aims to evaluate the role of the neighbourhood effect at Latvian elections and identify stable spatial voting clusters. The degree of spatial autocorrelation and changes in it were analysed for each parliamentary party and the non-parliamentary but still influential Latvian Russian Union (LRU). Statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low support were identified and compared; their steadiness over the study period was examined. The structure of these clusters is generally the same for the 'Russian' parties (Harmony and the LRU), whilst the 'Latvian' parties are characterized by greater spatial diversity. The analysis shows that regions bordering on Russia have clear spatial clusters where election results correspond to the parties' attitudes towards Russian speakers and the Russian Federation. The 'Russian' parties and those more or less favourably disposed to Russian speakers (For a Good Latvia, For Latvia from the Heart) have clusters of high support in the area and the 'Latvian' parties of low. This pattern, however; may be due to the high proportion of the non-Latvian population in Latgale (a region with strong historical connections with Russia) and the character of the development of the border area, rather than to the proximity to the Russian border.

DT Article
AB The humanitarian crisis in Syria has fuelled the Circassian issue in Russia. Escaping from the war, hundreds of Syrian Circassians (Adyghe) chose Russia as their destination because their ancestors came to the Middle East from the North Caucasus. Syrian Circassians have faced difficulties in entering Russia and staying there regardless of the state's ability to accept a large number of immigrants. In the case of receiving Syrian Adyghe, Russian authorities were suspicious about: (1) growing Circassian activism before the Olympics in Sochi; (2) ISIS infiltration; and (3) ethnic tensions in the Southern regions. Nevertheless, many Syrian Circassians settled in Russia due to the support extended by local Adyghe. Our findings are based on interviews and public polls conducted in Karachay-Cherkessia in 2017 and Adygea in 2018.

DT Article
DE European Parliament; common commercial policy; 'new generation' trade
   agreements; political conditionality; regulatory cooperation
AB The new, post-Lisbon reality of the European Union foreign economic policy is reflected in the "new generation" of trade agreements and the strengthened powers of the European Parliament (EP) in commercial policy. While the former is considered a prime example of the EU's economic neoliberalism, the latter interferes with it. The EP's involvement in trade policy has been accompanied by a few myths about its overly protectionist and politicized stance. This study attempts to deconstruct these myths by presenting an overarching, empirically and theoretically grounded overview of the EP's trade policy preferences. The results indicate that at least one of these myths is not justified. The EP stance cannot be called overly protectionist. Due to its special institutional role, the European Parliament compared with other EU institutions, focuses more on sensitive sectors of the economy, it also provides strong support for the "deep" neoliberal trade agenda. As for the politicization of trade, the European Parliament has indeed pressed for linking trade agreements to the Union's foreign policy objectives and for the strict promotion of political conditionality. However, it is not considered as an obstacle, but rather a contribution to increasing global economic interdependence.

AB The work is devoted to the problem of attribution of cyberattacks as one of the top important issues on the global agenda of world politics. The subject of this research is targeted offensive computer attacks that perform state tasks. The authors have systematically analyzed the conceptual apparatus, classification features and general indicators, a set of problems related to identification of reliable sources of cyberattacks, as well as the features of targeted attacks and cybernetic groups supported by state actors. This allowed to conclude that the problem of attribution is emerging as a new scientific direction in the field of international information security. Based on the analysis of relevant studies of academic institutions and private companies, an attribution classification was proposed. It was utilized to review conceptual informal models of targeted computer attacks. The authors have analyzed issues of the applied methodological apparatus, which may affect the reliability of conclusions on imposing responsibility on the perpetrator of cyber-attack, while noting that there is a contradiction between the perception of the attribution results by various political blocs and unions. At the same moment, the USA and its allies are reported to pursue a policy of dominance in the field of attribution of targeted cyber-attacks. The paper proves the impact of modern breakthrough information technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on the security of cyberspace as well as the impact of the attribution problem on the level of international security and strategic stability. This issue includes a complex set of political, regulatory, organizational and technical tasks with a high degree of uncertainty, where political aspects are playing a central role. The conclusions are confirmed by the statistics of public reports of IT companies and publications of leading research institutes. The main scientific result of the work is formulation of the problem of divergence in the attribution of computer attacks between political blocs and alliances, which negatively affects international security. The authors propose topical measures to solve the problem of attribution of cyberattacks.

AB The article presents the results of comparing the belief in information conspiracies in connection with personality traits among representatives of Generations Y and X, nationalities - the Russians and the Kumyks. We call information conspiracies those that are presented in the information space and are presented as close to reality. Therefore, users who get acquainted with information conspiracies do not doubt and believe in them. The sample was presented by the Russian university students and middle-aged working people. The questionnaire of conspiracy mentality (CMQ) (Bruder, Haffke) and the FPI technique (Farenberg, Zarg and Gampel) have been applied. It was revealed that the older the generation, the more it believes in the state conspiracy; generations have stable beliefs about the presence of a political conspiracy; the representatives of the Kumyk group are more prone to exaggeration of the importance of conspiracy than the group of the Russians generation Y; the personality trait "irritability" correlates with the scale of belief in public conspiracy; there was a negative dependence of emotional lability and belief in a political conspiracy. The results are compared with the data of foreign studies on the samples of representatives of the USA, Great Britain, Turkey, Germany. It was concluded that it is possible to observe cultural and intergenerational differences in expression of conspiracy mentality. Representatives of Generation Y believe more in political and public conspiracies. Representatives of Generation X believe more in public conspiracy and secret organizations.

AB The author offers a general comparative overview of the relations of three key countries-Russia, China, and the United States. A new geopolitical picture of the world is presented with three centers of power. The triangle evolves, changing the potential of each of its sides. The three-party relationships are not equipollent. China is building up its economic, nuclear, and political potential, turning into a peer competitor of the United States on the world stage. Russia competes with the United States only in the military-strategic sphere. That is why US foreign policy today is aimed at "double containment " of both Russia and China. At the same time, Washington seeks to rely on its allies both in Europe, strengthening NATO, and in the Indo-Pacific region, pursuing a "latticework " strategy. This promises a long-term confrontation between the US angle and the Chinese and Russian angles of the triangle.

AB "Niva" journal intended for family reading and in many ways became the legislator of Russian journal periodicals: weekly issues contained news content about world and national life, scientific achievements and events, biographies of outstanding contemporaries and historical figures, political review (including photo reports of military operations), reproductions of paintings and illustrations for Russian art works occupied a significant amount and European artists. Since 1894, monthly literary and popular science applications containing various articles about literature, fashion novelties, an application for children and wall calendars have become available to subscribers of the journal. The genre variety of literary, artistic and scientific texts intertwined with rich illustrative material, the compositional logic of the text placement and visual material, the steady thematic practice content of the journal's almost half-century existence - all this contributed to the formation of "Niva" as a significant source on the artistic history culture of the Russian Empire. It is worth noting the special journal role in shaping the image of contemporary Russian artistic life and the state of art among a wide range of its readers. The journal fully corresponded to the model of the educational mission.

AB The most promising strategies for the development of political science and the theory of international relations are considered. Effective institutions of both national and global governance, designed to establish and effectively maintain the norms of collective action are in demand under the conditions of strategic instability. Indisputable priority, in terms of international law, representativeness, institutional regulation, political mission, and its functional role, remains, according to the author, with the UN. New structures that are actively being formed along with traditional international organizations under the dominant influence of rising powers are being called upon to play a new significant role. Contrary to popular belief, the influence of international institutions is not associated with a reduction in the role of the nation state. The author believes that the idea of a primary threat from the so-called excessively "tough" states is not flawless: a kind of "conceptual rehabilitation" of states consistent in terms of efficiency and with a stable central government is now overdue. In the context of global turbulence, it is not "tough" but, rather, "fragile" (failed) states that pose the greatest danger. The regional dimension of modern political processes considered shows that the vector of globalization is evidently blurring in the course of massively increasing regionalization in its various manifestations, including macroregionalization and globalization. A separate challenge and, at the same time, a new horizon of opportunities for political science, political governance, and international relations are the processes of comprehensive digitalization, including the use of Big Data, artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies in political analytics. This actualizes Russia's efforts to form digital sovereignty. It is difficult to overestimate the role of historical consciousness: it is historical experience that forms the coordinate system for assessing current events and substantiating development forecasts. The natural driver of this process is the universities, which, in cooperation with local and regional communities, form the vectors of sociocultural activity and responsibility.

AB The principles in accordance with which the church elite was formed in Russia in the late Middle Ages and early modern times are discussed. For obvious reasons, it was not hereditary. The author focuses on the criteria that candidates for vacant cathedras had to meet. It has been shown that people from the environment of the white clergy had noticeable advantages, who, even before taking the monastic vows, acquired some of the skills necessary for a leader of the Church. There were relatively few representatives of the nobility among the bishops. For a successful church career, first of all, a certain level of training and a significant monastic "experience " were required. Belonging to an influential intra-church group and the support of representatives of the political elite made it easier for people who, as a result of lengthy training, had already passed a certain selection.

AB The C OwD-19 pandemic has caused significant transformations of electoral institu-tions, and provoked changes in the politics of electoral reforms in some polities. The paper claims that Russia has used a special model of electoral reform during the pan-demic that differs from both its previous experience and recommendations of interna-tional organizations. The comparative historical method is applied to bridge internal and external explanations that may offer an understanding of the current reform of electoral rule in the Russian political context. The pandemic has become a reason for changing traditional electoral procedures and for implementing this reform. Empirical evidence suggests that the reform has been implemented by a depoliticized techno-cratic procedure ignoring the principles of political consensus. The reform process implies a shift of the government's main efforts from decision-making to increasing dependence on propaganda, and informational confrontation with opponents in the subsequent reform cycle. The approach to the implementation of the electoral reform casts doubt on the level of public support for the new procedures and exacerbates political risks.

DE Russian Civil War; Carpathian Rus; Rusyns; Russian Siberia; Government
   of Admiral Alexander; Kolchak; Central Carpatho-Russian Council
AB The article considers and analyzes the peculiarities of the relations between the Russian Government of Admiral Kolchak and its departments with the Central Carpatho- Russian Council. The organization and conduct of the mobilization of Carpatho-Russian refugees and prisoners of war in the summer and fall of 1919 was chosen as a case for examination. Thus, the author set two main objectives: (1) to determine the attitude of Rusyn diasporas' civic organizations towards the formation of the Carpatho-Russian army units in Russia and the features of the interaction of the White East with other (besides Siberia) centers of the Carpatho- Russian national movement; (2) to identify the participation of the Omsk Government Departments in the decision-making to call Rusyns for military service in the Russian Army of Admiral Kolchak and the conduct of the mobilization. By the end of 1917 - the beginning of 1918, in the southern and southwestern regions of Russia, several hundred thousand Carpatho- Russians (Rusyns) - natives of Galicia, Bukovina and Subcarpathia (Ugric Rus), were in the position of refugees and prisoners of war. Since 1915-1916, along with the processes of political self-organization within the Carpatho-Russian social movement, the idea of creating national army units had been constantly circulating. During the Civil War, unlike in the south of Russia, the Central Carpatho-Russian Council operating in the east was able to initiate mobilization and the creation of army units on its basis. However, the Council's plan (the creation of a political center and armed forces outside its country that could play a significant part in the self- determination of the Carpathian lands) did not work out. The author states that several circumstances factored. First of all, that was Rusyns' disunity, dispersion across different countries and even continents, their lack of a single political center and a strong, authoritative leader both at home and in foreign diasporas. The uncertainty and doublespeak of the position of the anti-Bolshevik governments both in the south and in the east of Russia also had a strong influence. Besides, the Carpatho-Russian national movement did not have the support of the Entente governments. As a result, their influence on the decision-making at the Paris Peace Conference turned out to be minimal.

   Russia, and Ukraine
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT

DE Eastern Europe; Postcommunist societies; Gender studies; Women in
   politics; Political behavior; Feminism; Democratic transition
AB The dynamics of political processes in the postcommunist states of Eastern Europe in the 2000s to early 2020s demonstrated a significant number of new challenges and caused many issues, including those related to the transformation of the ways and models of political behavior, civic participation, protest actions, and so on. All these elements of social and political life, in my opinion, have a gender dimension deserving a detailed analysis. In this article, based on Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian cases, I consider what role women have played up to this point, and continue to play, in the public policy of the region and what ideological background serves the theoretical basis of this activity. In particular, these issues are analyzed in relation to the conflict situation-the war in Ukraine, which aggravated not only political, but also sociocultural and ideological confrontation in the studied societies. More or less commonplace is the conviction that to date none of these countries, considering all their fundamental differences, has achieved a sustainable gender balance in the highest governing institutions, and the gender approach is not sufficiently and/or effectively integrated into the policy-formulation process. At the same time, it is impossible to deny the fact that bright, charismatic persons who have appeared in the last 15 years-such as Yulia Tymoshenko, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Maria Kalesnikava, Yulia Galyamina, Yulia Navalnaya, and more-have made up a kind of collective "female face of politics" in postcommunist societies of Eastern Europe. I examine the practical consequences of these changes, and also look at those ideas and ideologies that influenced the formation of this portrait of a new sociopolitical reality. The range of these ideas is very wide and includes the legacy of the Soviet female-emancipatory project, European liberal thought, post-Soviet national projects, and other similar phenomena.

TI FIGHTING INTERNET MONOPOLIES IN CHINA AND THE U.S.A.

ID ANTITRUST
AB Since 2010s growth of the biggest Internet corporations (Big Tech) formed new monopolization challenges, from takeovers of competing start-ups to anti-competitive practices. Initially, regulators were not active, considering complexity of antitrust policies for the high-tech sector (e.g., not to demotivate R&D investments) and specifics of Internet markets (network effects, etc.). But since 2020 situation changed dramatically. Despite the active EU's role in developing model digital norms, special attention should be paid to the U.S.A. and China (as countries of origin of Big Tech and key Internet markets). In both economies, regulators previously executed a non-restrictive approach to the Internet markets and Big Tech, also as factor supporting their development and global leadership. But rising challenges and political events triggered new antitrust attack. For the PRC it was Jack Ma's speech amid rising concerns of the CPC leaders about income asymmetries. In the U.S.A. it was Trumpists' war on the "liberal media" and changes in long-term "alliance" between Democrats and Big Tech. Since 2020 China started antitrust investigations against Big Tech and other Internet corporations, imposed fines, and developed new regulations. In the U.S.A., due to the specifics of the legal and political system, focus was made on forming political and legal basis for further regulatory actions. Several lawsuits were initiated, critics of Internet monopolies were assigned on key positions in federal antitrust bodies, while Congress elaborated draft acts. Theoretical analysis shows that in both nations focus was made on the sharpest (for society and politicians) changes. New initiatives do not pose a threat to Big Tech's innovation activities yet. Less obvious is their correspondence to the digital economy specifics. So, it is still hard to understand whether these actions will lead to rise of innovations and competition. Long-term systematic development of regulation is needed - as well as serious theoretical research on "digital antitrust".

TI CAPITALISM IS ENDING, BUT "PREHISTORY" IS NOT?
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE capitalism; socialism; post-capitalism; "human prehistory"; Marxism
AB This article attempts to answer the question: is the description of Modernity in terms of "capitalism" justified? The author shows that during the history of the 20th-21st centuries, the pictures of capitalism drawn by theorists got more and more atypical elements. Among these are the theories of imperialism, dependent development, a single industrial society, and especially the world-system analysis. Also noteworthy is the description "modern" applied to the societies of this period. A situation has arisen where many phenomena fit into the concept of "capitalism", or "capitalism with numerous prefixes". Thus, "capitalism" in various guises becomes "too much". Eventually, capitalism itself has come down to the universal phenomena of violence, inequality and exploitation. The productivity of discussing modernity in a paradigm revolving around the notion of "capitalism" is becoming less and less obvious. Too wide range of practices has become associated with "capitalism with prefixes", which forced a number of researchers to refuse to identify modernity with capitalism in favor of various concepts based on retro-metaphors ("neo-feudalism"). Numerous concepts of "post-capitalism" have also emerged. The author substantiates that at the theory layer, the difference between the types of what is still interpreted as "capitalism" or already as "post-capitalism" does not have a qualitative character. Of all the aforesaid, the marxian concept of human "prehistory" becomes relevant as a more universal paradigmatic frame for comprehending modern trends. Therefore, the concept of communism will still remain a worldview horizon that gives a meaning to this "prehistory". In a situation where capitalism ends, but "prehistory" does not, this will make it possible to single out social relations that determine the "prehistory" nature by themselves, and not through the prism of denouncing or apologizing (which is "capitalism" initially) of their political discourses.

DT Article
DE Germany; energy transition; Russia; sanctions; nuclear power plants;
   coal; gas; oil; hydrogen; renewable energy sources
AB The article is devoted to energy policy of Germany. In the coalition treaty, the new German "red-green-yellow" coalition confirmed the commitment to achieve climate neutrality by 2045. In line with this goal Germany has developed a strategy to move away from coal as a primary source of energy. And, in the meantime, Berlin will close the last three Nuclear Power Plants by the end of the year 2022. The Russian special military operation in Ukraine has influenced the German energy policy significantly. Since February 2022, the German government has put a premium on substitution of Russian energy. The aim of this article is to analyze the coherence of the two policies: energy transition and rejection of Russian energy resources. The author explores phasing out nuclear power and coal, import of oil and gas, development of hydrogen production and renewables in Germany. The analysis revealed that two tracks do not complement each other. Both tracks should trace to the same goal - carbon-free energy, - but they have different temporal frameworks. While political elites claim to phase out Russian fuels within two years, the energy transition should take around 30 years. The natural gas was supposed to be the transitional energy, but more than half of it comes from Russia. Substitution of Russian coal and Russian oil requires more investment, and it could reduce the ability to subsidize renewables. Potential cooperation between Germany and Russia in hydrogen production was frozen. Only the policy aimed at improving energy efficiency and developing new building standards is likely to fit both tracks.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE China; ideological security; Marxism; liberalism; Westernization;
   values; populism; social justice
AB China's ability to regulate and control the situation in the ideological sphere has increased markedly during the recent decade. At the same time, Chinese society is becoming more and more diverse, which makes social thought more and more heterogeneous. The article focuses on the changes that have taken place in relations between the ideology of CPC and non-official trends of thought. Through publications of Chinese researchers the article analyzes the key aspects of the CPC policy aimed at strengthening the leadership of the official ideology and preventing radicalization of public sentiment. In China experts are especially concerned about the ability of non-mainstream ideas to challenge the "national ideological security". The increase in the influence of official ideology led to weakening of neo-liberalism, universal values, and historical nihilism. However, the mode of interaction between the official ideology of the CPC and other ideological currents cannot be reduced to confrontation between "Chinese authoritarianism" and "Western liberalism". The full picture can be seen only by taking into account the complex relationship of Party ideology with the diverse ideas of the "gray" zone. Intense debates in China are focused on trends that have no clear theoretical basis and political orientation, but are capable to mobilize masses and radicalize public sentiment. The authorities search for optimal response to outbursts of radical Internet-populism while seeking to put nationalism and consumerism into reasonable limits. The reaction of Chinese society to the coronavirus epidemic has demonstrated that at a time of crisis and decrease in people's confidence in the effectiveness of the work of the state there was an explosive growth of pro-Western and populist sentiments. The task of combining the leading role of the normative ideology of the CPC with the diversity of social ideas will remain relevant over a long time.

AB The history of the People's Republic of China over the past four decades is associated with successful economic reforms that have brought China to one of the most influential countries in the world, have become a symbol of the new rise of the East and the advent of the Asia-Pacific region in world geopolitics. Throughout this time, the only area where changes in China were not recorded was the political system and the state system. Hopes that the market economy would create a democratic system corresponding to itself, democratic principles of public life were not justified, the contradiction between a dynamic economy and a conservative political system persisted. The anti-corruption campaign, which marked the inauguration of Xi Jinping, became a major event in the party and political life of China, revealing deep and serious problems in the Chinese state. Its direct consequence was the strengthening of authoritarian tendencies and the beginning of the process of reforming the state system of the People's Republic of China, the creation of a controlling power, which violated the previous tradition of redistribution of power between generations of leaders and within a generation. The focus of Chinese modernization shifted from the economic to the political system, which became the central part of the Chinese model of socialism and the core of the new theoretical system.

AB In many countries, the rapid evolution of digital platform technology has triggered significant shifts in competition law. Many have interpreted China's recent moves as signaling a broader crackdown on private entrepreneurship. In Russia, even before the invasion of Ukraine, government policy became increasingly restrictive toward foreign internet platforms. This paper analyzes the development and enforcement of competition law in Russia and China. We show that both technologically driven changes in the ability of digital platform firms to exercise market power and changes in the external political environment affect the relative strength and coalitions of interested bureaucratic actors and influence policy outcomes.

AB This article analyzes bilateral relations between India and the United States in the context of a new round of confrontational bipolarity between Washington and Beijing. The analysis of the historical dynamics of relations between the United States and India demonstrate that the US policy towards New Delhi has always been of an opportunistic nature and depended primarily on the events in southern Asia and the Indian Ocean, and on the dynamics of US relations with key Asian powers-the Soviet Union and China. India has never had an independent value for the United States. The existence of common values has always been used by both parties only to justify the next rapprochement between them and has always been determined by purely pragmatic considerations. At the same time, maintaining close relations with the United States is a strategic necessity for India, since the development of the Indian economy and the ability of New Delhi to balance between great powers depend on them. The authors come to the conclusion that today the imperatives of Washington and New Delhi have not changed significantly; therefore, there is no need to talk about a deep transformation of American-Indian relations.

AB The article explores an understudied issue - the social adaptation of Rusins from among the prisoners of the First World War, who became ordinary participants in public, military and political events in Western Siberia during the Russian Revolution. The authors take the tragic fate of Grigory Georgievich Mokriy (1894-1920) as an illustrative example. In his life, Mokriy twice alternately combined the activities of a psalmist of the Greek Catholic and later Orthodox churches with military service in the Austro-Hungarian and White armies and a short-term participation in the anti-Bolshevik underground. The authors connect draw on a complex of unpublished sources, which is part of the archival criminal case initiated by the Omsk GubChK against Mokriy, as well as on church records, press materials, and memoirs. The research metholodgy involves the anthrological approach, problem-chronological, historical-comparative, and biographical methods. This theoretical combination made it possible to interpret Mokriy's behavior during the social cataclysms in the most detailed way, linking the biographical facts with the specific historical situation and personalities, with whom he was directly or indirectly connected.

AB The structure, priorities, conceptual framework, methods, and resources of EU policies in the Official Development Assistance (ODA) program are considered. Research shows that the EU funding of ODA programs for the post-Soviet space hiked fourfold between 2010 and 2020. The share of funding for Central Asian states decreased substantially compared to the Western part of the post-Soviet space against the background of confrontation with Russia, as well as due to presidential elections in Belarus. This paper argues that this redistribution is caused by geopolitical factors of EU policy. A conclusion is drawn that the recent declarations by the EU leadership about strengthening the "hard" power and the "geopolitical" agenda are not new and reflect long-term trends in EU foreign policy. Thus, a significant share of ODA funds is traditionally allocated to "social infrastructure," strengthening Brussels' control over the sociopolitical sphere in target countries of the periphery, aiming to bring them under EU influence in the economy, governance, goal setting, and ideology. This policy serves the interests of the EU, entrenching asymmetrical "metropole-periphery" relations between the EU and target counties.

AB In the article, based on the materials of the epistolary and scientific-journalistic heritage of the leaders of the Siberian regionalism, the scenarios of intercultural communication of the Russian and indigenous population of Siberia in the second half of the 19th - early 20th centuries, constructed by the authors, are revealed. The methodological basis of the study was the approaches of a new cultural and intellectual history, and the representativeness of the conclusions is due to the involvement of an array of texts devoted to the reflection by the community of Siberian regionalists of "foreign" and Russian issues as part of the sociopolitical discourse of the post-reform era. In the course of the study, the authors revealed the main positions of the leaders of the regionalism in constructing scenarios for intercultural communication of the indicated groups. It has been established that the perceptions of the regionalists about Siberia as a colony within Russia actualized in their correspondence, journalism and scientific works the topic of limiting the rights and economic potential of both the indigenous and the Russian population in the implementation of the imperial colonization project. In the opinion of Siberian liberals, overcoming this state of affairs was possible not only by means of spreading agricultural practices, but, mainly, under the condition of extensive enlightenment and educational work among indigenous peoples and Russian settlers. One of the landmark scenarios for the cultural cooperation of the autochthons with the Russian population, the regionalists considered the active inclusion of representatives of the steppe aristocracy in the system of higher education and state activities, which, in their opinion, opened up good chances for the influence of local elites on their fellow tribesmen and contributed to their socialization outside the repressive models of Russification offered national-conservative forces of the Russian Empire.

   technological formation; digital project; coronavirus pandemic; digital
   divide; digital utopias and dystopias
AB The impact of digitization on four spheres of society, i.e., economic, political, social, and spiritual, is analyzed. Digitization is defined as the diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICT) that can bring about both positive (legitimate) and negative (wrongful) effects. At the same time, today the digitization of public spheres directly involves the component of ensuring the digital security of society, which is becoming increasingly global in character. Cyber wars and cyber attacks cause economic damage on a global scale, amounting to six trillion dollars US annually, which is commensurate with the economic losses of wartime. Large-scale digitization of public spheres for the first time in human history creates an objective opportunity for constructing and designing future social states, which makes a fundamental difference between the course of future socio-economic and political processes and the historical evolution of the previous eras. This gave rise to a dichotomy of virtual utopias and dystopias of Future projects. Dystopias are inspired by visions of the coming "digital slavery," while utopias focus on visions of a "digital paradise." Polarized views on the digital Future are based on the processes of the "digital divide," the meaning of which is that digitization contributes to a significant increase in inequality in access to digital goods, which in turn results in a growing inequality in the distribution of income and wealth. The coronavirus pandemic promoted a powerful acceleration of digitization processes, which acted as a form of society's adaptation to its stresses and harmful consequences. Digitization has made social distancing possible and cost-effective. At the same time, the pandemic was conducive to a colossal increase in the economic power and political influence of digital corporations, which objectively requires a sharp increase in the regulatory role of the state, which should put digitization under effective public control.

ID BANKING SECTOR; FINANCIALIZATION; COMPETITION; MARKET; TRENDS; IMPACT;
   LOANS; RISE
AB Using the example of Russia, we argue that financialisation in an authoritarian state can take place primarily through formation in financial sector monopoly-like state-related structures controlled by a limited circle of the irreplaceable elite. It occurs because financialisation and new financial technologies in an authoritarian state increase both the opportunities and incentives for dominance of large state-dependent institutions in the financial sector. The authoritarian state and its elite are using financial and information technology developments in accordance with their goals, adopting and enhancing some financial practices and innovations from the experience of developed countries while rejecting, distorting or slowing down others. As a result, on the one hand, within the framework of the formation of such monopoly-like institutions, financialisation is proceeding actively, the role of finance and financial relations in society is increasing everywhere and the use of new financial technologies, digitalisation and financial inclusion are expanding. On the other hand, some financial markets remain underdeveloped because either they imply a certain degree of competition, diversity, institutional quality and independence from state voluntarism, or the state and authoritarian elite have not yet fully elaborated a strategy of integrating these financial markets into the orbit of their interests. Thus financialisation in DEEs with an authoritarian political regime can strengthen and facilitate the dominance of authoritarian elites. We draw these conclusions considering the example of financialisation in Russia in the last two decades, where the banking sector is at the core of the financial system.

AB A unified strategy of formation of a new organization on security in Asia is absent. Such an initiative is not being emanated by the states of the region. Up to a dozen of varying interpretations of the notion of an "Asian NATO" are spread among the political-academic circles of different countries. The main bulk of such interpretations remain of an American authorship and are aimed at formation of military-political alliance targeted against China, and rather through activation of existing formats than through establishing a formalized military alliance. There is an evolution of the quadrilateral format of QUAD. The bifurcation point in its development requires a choice between evolution towards the real military alliance or in direction of a hybrid strategy of general political and economic interaction within the Asia-Pacific region, with only marginal components in security area. The American concept of Indo-Pacific region is criticized by the states of the region, and especially by the ASEAN member countries. The role of ASEAN as organizer and coordinator in the security area is decreasing. New configurations of military-political cooperation in Asia and in the Asia-Pacific region are emerging (Japan-India, India-Indonesia-Australia). Russia should be cautious in reacting to not-yet-formed American initiative targeted against China, to avoid actions leading to a new split between groups of states in Asia as a whole and specifically in the Asia-Pacific region, with understanding that in such a split Russia would play not a leading but a secondary role. The majority of the states of the Asia-Pacific macro-region are not ready to shape or join any formal anti-Chinese alliance under the U.S. leadership.

AB The research presents a historical overview of the organization and activities of the Tomsk notary in the first decade of Soviet period. The research interest to the history of the notarial system on the territory of modern Tomsk region is associated not only with the adoption of legal acts of the Soviet era, but also is determined by the specifics of the formation of Soviet power in Tomsk, socio-political and socio-economic relations in the region, and its administrative and territorial division. The purpose of the article is to identify the unique characteristics of the formation and activities of the Tomsk notary in 1917-1927. The author studied the legal acts on the organization and functioning of notarial system on a national scale, determined their implementation features on the territory of the Tomsk province and the Tomsk district, analyzed the main conditions affecting the work of the Tomsk notary bodies, studied the organizational structure of the Tomsk notary system and its jurisdiction, staff, important activities and the funding of notary offices in the region. The research is based on the unpublished documents of the State Archive of Tomsk Region, published legal and political acts as well as scientific works of Russian historians and jurists. The studied material allows us to assert that in 1917-1927 the Tomsk notary went through several organizational processes: the gradual truncation of the notarial function, the abolition of the pre-revolutionary functions of the notary, including the period of its restoration during the Government of A.V. Kolchak, the formation of a new type of notary. The author came to the conclusion that in the first decade of Soviet era the Tomsk notary was able to allocate its own specific place in state bodies and carry out activities in qualitatively new state level. However, despite The Regulations on State Notary of the RSFSR in 1922, 1923, 1926 the organizational, structural and jurisdiction of the state notary bodies were definitely not specified. In the first decade of Soviet power, such problems as frequent turnover of notaries, weak material base, and low financing were identified in the work of the Tomsk notary. At the same time, the activity of Tomsk notaries was a "profitable business" for the region. The formation and development of the Tomsk state notary was affected by remaining civil turnovers and goods-money relations, the professional competence of Tomsk notaries, as well as the profitability state notaries in the region.

AB This article is based on a report presented at the Scientific Session of the RAS General Meeting (Moscow, December 15, 2021). The reaction of society to the pandemic in Russia and other countries of the world is analyzed from an anthropological point of view. The features of the behavior and psychological reaction of residents of different regions, professional groups, and ethnocultural communities are considered with account for gender, age, and cultural characteristics (collectivism-individualism, looseness-tightness, power distance). Particular attention is paid to phobias and social activity during the pandemic; the growing role of nation-states in overcoming the consequences of the pandemic is discussed. The results presented can be used as an additional source of information for taking effective measures finally to overcome the pandemic and, most importantly, its negative social and political consequences.

AB Germany's transition to a climate-neutral economy, the main parameters of which were determined by the European Green Exchange Rate (December 2019) and clarified in the updated Law on Climate Protection of Germany (June 2021) and the EU Fit-for-55 program (July 2021), leads to the abandonment of the use of primary energy sources, including their import from Russia. The energy transformation of the German market economy presumed a gradual restructuring of the existing model of German-Russian cooperation in the energy sector, including its transfer to priority cooperation in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. Brussels and Berlin responded to the special military operation of the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine with large-scale economic and political sanctions (March-May 2022), which included significant restrictions on the import of Russian coal and oil. At the same time, the German federal authorities outlined the necessity to abandon Russian pipeline gas and petroleum products, as well as the deprivation of ownership of the two main players from the Russian Federation in the German oil and gas market - Gazprom and Rosneft companies. Their German partners have frozen participation in Russian projects. At the end of February, the certification of the Nord Stream -2 offshore gas pipeline was stopped. Interdepartmental state interaction and scientific and technical cooperation in the energy sector have been terminated. These events indicated the readiness of the government coalition in the short term to replace the previous model of energy cooperation, which has performed well for half a century, and to move to independence from Russian fossil resources and their derivatives. The author analyzes the reasons and content of the current measures taken by Berlin, as well as their medium- and long-term consequences for German-Russian cooperation.

AB The problem of identifying the factors of individual altruism in the socio-cultural context and at the intercountry level is posed and solved for the first time. Econometric analysis of panel data on 34 countries for 2010-2019 confirmed the results, obtained in local screenings for particular regions and population groups. Namely, such factors as social welfare, happiness and civic engagement showed statistical significance in the regression analysis of the sample under study. Furthermore, there are reasons to assume that some relations may be parabolic in nature and, thus, indicate the nonlinear development of the altruism phenomenon. In addition, the previously overlooked socio-economic determinants stipulated by the philosophy of collaboration were tested on empirical level. Through the inclusion of new variables, it was possible to identify the special role of the culture of tolerance in the generation of altruistic behavior. Also, econometric calculations revealed that the nature of some factors' impact depends on the level of economic development of a certain country. According to the results, primary positive determinants of altruism for developed countries are happiness and political activity, while for developing countries - social well-being. Hierarchical cluster analysis made it possible to identify and further study a subgroup of developed countries with more advanced culture of tolerance. The findings showed the importance of determining the phenomenon of happiness, complexity of which presets the principle differentiation of altruism factors for different groups of countries. The results of this work can be used for further study of collaborative mechanisms, in particular, the study of motivation and effectiveness of international development assistance.

ID TRANSGENERATIONAL RESPONSES; EVOLUTION
AB In this paper I examine the research program of epigenetics, which corresponds to the entry into the post-genomic era and represents a link between the social sciences and the life sciences. I show that epigenetics presupposes a reconsideration of the rigid version of genetic determinism and demonstrates the importance of the impact of the environment on the state and evolution of the genome, which should be regarded as an epigenome. I draw attention to the phenomenon of transgenerational inheritance, which suggests a notable correlation of states of stress and physical deprivation of individuals, with the state of mind and health of their descendants, and leads to the idea that social dynamics should be considered in terms of evolution of a holistic system over time. It makes one ponder over the fate of people and their descendants, depending on circumstances determined by the metamorphosis occurring in society over rather long segments of time. I argue that such consideration can be carried out in the context of the methodology of biocultural co-constructivism, which allows presenting this evolution as a process of mutual determination of all components of this system, in particular, having in mind gene-cultural interactions.

DE natural language semantics; type theory; understanding as computation
AB Olga Kozyreva reviews approaches to the conceptualization of indexical and demonstrative expressions and suggests that we re-think the relationship between semantics and pragmatics to better comprehend referential effects peculiar to these expressions. The new division that she proposes relies on the difference between the notions of the ideal recipient and real recipients of the message. This difference seems highly problematic although her resort to the analysis of communication and language usage is on the contrary well based and suggestive. This article deals with an alternative justification of the suggested rethinking based on the computational metaphor in semantics. This metaphor depicts understanding as a computational process resulting in meaning and reference. In terms of type theory meanings are types and references are terms of these types. Language expressions are programs to be compiled and run by the recipient in order to obtain the meaning packed in them by the sender. Understanding is therefore a part of communication activity and is closely intertwined with pragmatics. This explains Kozyreva's introducing pragmatic notions into semantics. At the same time, this leaves room for pragmatics proper if we understand it as the study of language usage other than meaning communication.

DE postmodernity; information; cynicism; deconstruction; post-truth
AB The variety of connotations related to modern society indicates the incredible difficulty in determining the properties and characteristics of the current sociocultural reality. One of the most revealing characteristics is an indication of total hyperinformatization, accompanied by a change in the conceptual status of "knowledge" and a specific convergence of "knowledge" and "information". Information becomes a constant element of everyday interaction, as a result of which the subject, living in a sociality that is constantly becoming more complex, has a need for its own epistemological strategies for dealing with information. At the same time, the subject itself is undergoing changes associated with rapidly growing changes in the social field and the impossibility, in connection with this, to find a stable basis for building one's own subjectness. The article attempts to characterize the cognitive strategy of the postmodern subject against the background of the unfolding cynical attitude of consciousness, designed to compensate for the "trauma" and "split" of such consciousness. In connection with this, the cognitive strategy is associated with the subject's attitude to minimize psycho-emotional costs and unfolds as a special way, a manifest mode of deconstruction. Deconstruction, therefore, is understood as a simplification and modification of social reality to the point where cost minimization is possible. The article shows that such deconstruction is based on the reduced expectations of the individual regarding hidden motives in the behavior of the Other, on the basis of which one "reassembles" the social reality for oneself and creates a "story", in which one constructs an understanding of "truth-for-itself'. Thus, the ontological statuses of the concepts "truth" or "falsehood" will not be of fundamental importance for the subject, since it will rely on the clarity and definability of these settings for itself. The very concept of "knowledge" becomes synonymous with the concepts of "convenient", "acceptable" and "relevant".

ID ETHNOPOPULISM; POPULISM; RISE
AB A critical interpretation of the existing academic texts devoted to various phenomena related to ethnic politics raises the following questions: what are the criteria for ethnicity? What are the nodal points of intersection of ethnicity and politics? Based on the constructivist interpretation of ethnicity as a changeable concept that cannot be reduced to cultural and linguistic originality, the definition of an ethnic group as a social group that has distinctive cultural features (in the broadest sense) and the idea of the hereditary transmission of group membership is proposed. Based on this definition, it is proposed not to limit the subject field of ethnopolitical science to the interaction of the state with ethnic groups, but to include populism (in the form of right-wing populism, understood as ethnopopulism) and nationalism (as a product of ethnic mobilization). Particular attention is paid to regionalism as a particular but very important case of nationalism. The conclusions are supported by examples from Western European political practice. Based on the extremely inclusive constructivist definition of ethnicity, it is possible and necessary to understand the subject field of ethnopolitical science as broadly as possible in order to strengthen its position in the circle of sociopolitical disciplines, in particular, in studying sociopolitical processes in the European Union.

AB Since the Second World War, the United Kingdom has served as a transatlantic bridge between the United States and Europe and as a conduit of the US influence in European affairs. Since joining the EU, Britain has been one of the main contributors to the European Union's foreign, security, and defense policies. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU in 2020 marked a milestone in European politics. The UK's decision to leave the European Union has raised questions concerning probable implications of Brexit for the transatlantic relationship and the European balance of power. Brexit entails multifaceted changes in Britain's global posture, in particular, new nuances in its dealings with the United States and European partners. These shifts embrace a wide range of political, defense, security, and economic issues. They have stirred up debates on the British strategy's tilt towards the Indo-Pacific and Britain's future cooperation with its American ally and the EU. Having considered developments in the Washington-London-Brussels relations in the wake of the Brexit referendum, this article figures out trends in the interactions of these key players that reflect their visions of a post-Brexit reality.

AB The article examines the phenomenon of the political longevity of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The subject of the study is the second period of her chancellorship (2013-2021), as few German leaders have managed to stay in office longer than two terms. The author analyses in detail what objective factors and personal qualities helped Merkel to win the 2013 and 2017 elections, overcome declining personal popularity and objective voter fatigue, and get through all crises, including the migration crisis and COVID-19. The article examines how the tactics and strategy of the first female chancellor have transformed in response to changing political conditions. It explores the tools with which Merkel built her image as nonpartisan leader of the nation, and how she became a hostage to the image she created in 2015. The decision to accept refugees was a turning point in Merkel's career; thus, the author pays particular attention to the ways in which she helped maintain her chancellorship. The paper uses the theory of how women's leadership differs from men's. The conclusion is drawn that Merkel developed her own special personal method of securing power and maintaining the image she needs. The main secret of her success is not the use of force but quick learning and adaptation, based on her instinct for political survival.

AB In the paper, the consequences of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union are addressed in connection to the status of Northern Ireland and intercommunity relations in the region. Having analyzed the conflict's nature, the authors conclude that neither ethnic nor religious but rather political aspects are dominant. The EU has played an important role in the complex process of peace-building; the Europeanization rules were practically implemented, since both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland were the EU members, as well as the members of the European Single Market and the EU Customs Union. Also, the principles of multilevel governance were applied, provided in the Good Friday Agreement. Eventually, Brexit led to the disturbance of a fragile consensus formed after the GFA and brought back to agenda the issue of the island unification under the republican banner. The agreement reached between the EU and the UK means that a visible border on the island is absent, which is profitable for the Irish/Republican community but separates the region regulatorily from the rest of the country. This state of affairs causes natural dissatisfaction within the Unionist community. Taking into account the predominantly political nature of the conflict, the authors analyze the actual dynamics of the intersegmental discrepancies in the Northern Ireland and the possibilities to settle the managerial contradictions caused by Brexit. Since the attitude toward Brexit and Ireland's political future is defined largely by the community affiliation, the risks of further destabilization in the region are high, as well as of re-actualization of the conflict potential.

AB Little is currently known about how voters arrive at their vision of an ideal president. Along with an ideal president's traits, this study examines the domains Russian voters draw upon when formulating these expectations. 20 in-depth interviews allowed an initial list of qualities that fall into broad categories of leadership effectiveness, morality, qualifications, and sociability. The domains from which voters derive their expectations include comparative, contextual, functional sources, and leadership style domain. Furthermore, 450 interviews examined the commonness of personality expectations in a quantitative sample. The respondents were more likely to discuss specific leadership traits than social skills or qualifications.

DE science; system-communicative theory; humanization; Ilya T. Kasavin
AB In my commentary on the book by Ilya T. Kasavin, I would like to start from some provisions of the system-communicative theory, which is directly related to the three basic leitmotifs of the commented work: from the understanding of science as communication, from the ethical interpretation of science, and from the question of its political subjectability. In contrast to Kasavin's normative position, namely, his statement about the desirable and almost definitive humanity of science, I argue that its communicative originality does not always correspond to the humanistic expectations that society traditionally associates with science. And the point is not only that the meaning and effects of a person (researcher or expert) are usually "excluded" from the factors of scientific observation as distorting its objectivity. To an even greater extent, science is characterized by alienation that is generated by the organizational effects of science - a huge disciplinary and structurally differentiated enterprise, the functionality of which algorithms scientific communication so much that there is essentially no room for an individual's free decision. The matter is aggravated by the fact that traditional collegial expert structures (academic and dissertation councils, competition and attestation commissions, etc.) can no longer make their decisions (only) on the basis of a deliberative discussion of the scientific achievements of employees, any deep acquaintance with scientists themselves and their projects. Today, it is customary to focus on averaged and algorithmized markers of scientific success (on the Hirsch indices of researchers, on the impact factors of the journals where they are published, on the distribution of scientific institutions by category).

AB In the present article, we study the role of unitive and alienating elements of culture in the interaction of Russian citizens and migrants of different ethnicities from Central Asia. The interest of scientists in the problems of ethnic and cultural interactions between indigenous and newcomers is quite significant. However, we have not found a typology of groups of the host community as carriers of uniting and separating elements of culture with migrants from Central Asian countries in domestic and foreign scientific sources. In scientific works, there is no correlation between the cultural attitudes of these groups and their level of conflict. The application of the anthropological approach allowed us to reveal the cultural characteristics of migrants, which are positively or negatively perceived by the local population, and assess their influence on the conflict potential of the interactions. The perceptive analysis of the interactions between migrants and the local community served as a basis for the interpretation of the results of the questionnaire survey of Yekaterinburg citizens held in 2019-2020 (n = 476). We applied the descriptive method of information analysis, correlation analysis and cluster analysis. In general, based on the set sample, the average number of attractive and repelling features of migrants is almost the same. The higher the number of repelling and unacceptable cultural habits of migrants mentioned by the respondents is, the more common open conflicts with them are. Classification of Ykaterinburg citizens based on cluster analysis allowed defining three groups: bearers of alienating cultural elements, bearers of unitive cultural elements, and neutral citizens. Most frequently, "bearers of alienating cultural elements" mention that migrants themselves initiate conflicts. This cluster is characterized by the maximum level of conflicts, in both latent and open forms. We come to the conclusion that the coincidence of differentiating cultural elements and the reasons for conflict may contribute to the fact that the interaction between migrants and the host community becomes an open conflict.

AB This study explores communications at the theoretical level using a philosophical approach to the analysis of social communications in the field of education. The relevance of the topic is due to the need to clarify the existing concepts that characterize the current situation in the field of social communications in the context of the rapid development of information technology, as well as the concepts' categorical apparatus. The article raises the issue of taking into account social communications in education, where the influence of modern information technologies over the past couple of years has manifested itself in the most obvious and even revolutionary way, which necessitates a critical approach in applying the existing theoretical foundations in the study of social communications. The theoretical basis of the study was the concepts of literacy, which began to take shape in the philosophy of language. The appeal to the content of these concepts was due to the fact that they allow, at the theoretical level, characterizing the totality of processes taking place in the field of social communications in education in the context of the evolution of information technologies. The aim of the study was to explicate the possibilities of existing literacy concepts to reflect the nuances of changes in the field of social communications that are taking place in education in the context of the introduction of smart technologies. To reach this aim, the authors demonstrated that changes of ontological, axiological, or paradigm nature influenced the emergence and evolution of the concepts of literacy and revealed the specifics of modern smart technologies and their impact on social and communicative processes in the field of education. As a result of the study, the authors found that the emergence of new smart technologies and the transition of education to the state of smart education influenced the formation of ontological (the emergence of new information technologies adaptive to the user) and axiological (the needs of individual students are considered as the most important value of education) grounds for the emergence of a new concept of literacy. This concept will have to take into account the nuances that arise in connection with the introduction of fundamentally different information technologies into the sphere of social communications.

AB The development of the international political changes in Central and South Asia is analyzed in the article in connection with the consequences of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and the Taliban's second rise to power (the first one was in 1996). It is shown that the peaceful transformation of Afghanistan is impeded by such persistent threats as religious extremism, terrorism, illegal drug trafficking. The complex mosaic of regional relations, in which Afghanistan is becoming an important element due to the changes that have happened in this country, is determined in Asia by the growing rivalry and competitive struggle of major economic states of the region, as well as global players, and by the efforts of all of them to build various international coalitions (Shanghai Cooperation Organization, RIC - Russia, India, China; Quadripartite Security Dialogue - QUAD, C5+1, Organization of Turkic States, etc.). Of particular interest in this regard is the position of the neighboring states - the three Central Asian nations (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan), as well as China, Pakistan, India and Iran. Apart from that, this study also outlines the most important challenges for the national security interests of Afghanistan's Asian neighbors. An optimal scenario for both Afghanistan's Asian neighbors and Russia would imply achieving a stable consensus in this country. Afghanistan becoming a full member of such an influential international bloc as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, where Russia, Central Asian states and major Asian economic powers are already represented, can have positive consequences for the stabilization of the situation in the country and the whole Asian region. This would create favorable conditions for successful economic and political interaction between the Central and South Asian states. In conclusion the author emphasizes that the transformations in Afghanistan have complicated regional challenges, prompting neighboring states to focus on the military-political component of their security. Aiming to prevent a negative scenario in Afghanistan, they also multiplied diplomatic contacts with the current leadership of the country. The new international political configuration that is emerging in modern Asia dictates new approaches in the security sphere for the Asian states.

AB The author's understanding of the role of the social sciences and humanities in preserving and developing science as a sociocultural phenomenon is substantiated. This justification is built as an explication and critical analysis of the program of philosophical research in science and technology, the main content and results of which are presented in the monograph by I.T. Kasavin Science As a Humanistic Project (2020). This article describes how the search for new strategies for the study of science is carried out within the framework of Russian philosophy. The historicity of science is analyzed, and the complex topology of its genesis is shown, which does not fit into the linear scheme of historical continuity, reflecting the synchronous coexistence of different variations of science as a cultural phenomenon. The historicity of science makes us turn to the question of its cultural and historical agency; it is substantiated that this agency acquires a political character in the current activity. How can the political agency of science be perceived and consistently combined with the ethos of the expert community? According to the author, political agency and the range of interests that scientists defend in public are determined by understanding the essence of science as a cultural phenomenon. The existential and cultural-creative functions of science are emphasized; on this basis the author's interpretation of the humanistic project suggested by Kasavin is proposed as a program for the humanization of technoscience.

AB The article discusses the features and problems of the formation and development of civil society at the regional level, and reveals features of the interaction between the structures of regional power and civil society. The authors aim to analyze the formation of civil society in the conditions of political transformation in Voronezh Oblast and related institutional changes in its structure. To identify the features of a regional civil society, the system of relations between the government and civil society, the authors focus on the formation and development of civil practices of real participation of the population in the public sector. In the conditions of Voronezh Oblast, civil society is presented as a specific economic, social and cultural space in which a certain balance of various (individual and group, communica-tion and informal) interests is achieved, and these interests are implemented within the framework of diverse non-political forms of social collective life. This process at the region-al level has become a natural continuation of the all-Russian processes. In the region, its institutional prerequisites have been actively developing and still are developing: the legal field, the relationship between society and the authorities are significantly expanding, the conditions for the implementation of political and civil liberties are being improved. The analysis highlights the features of the development of civil society in the region: the necessary legal framework that allows creating conditions for the formation of civil society institu-tions, involving the population in management and independent resolution of issues of local importance; direct activity of the population; the creation of public chambers both in Voro-nezh Oblast and in municipal districts as "dialogue platforms" between the authorities and public organizations; creation of territorial public self-government. In conclusion, the authors state that the institutions of civil society in Voronezh Oblast are practically formed, showing a high adaptive potential and mobilization resource. The prospect of development of a regional civil society is at the root of the population based on national identity and cultural diversity, on a system of human resources and spiritual achievements of society, taking into account all regional characteristics.

AB The article discusses advantages and limitations of modern sociological activity in the context of socio-humanitarian knowledge crisis. The key idea of the article is that attention to intrascientific problems of sociology may help increase the collective capital of the symbolic power of sociological science in Russia and elsewhere. At the same time, in the light of current theoretical disputes and taking into account Russian and global sociopolitical conditions, a need to ceaselessly defend the scholarly status of sociology is emphasized. Scholars are usually making attempts to conceptualize the scientific status of sociology by defining its attributive features. The integral criteria of the scientific nature of sociology are: nomenclature of scientific specialties, educational standards, professional communities, academic structures, empiricism, methodologism. However, each regional sociological community has its specific scientific life world, rules of the game, professional thesaurus, as well as cognitive and social mission. The author believes that sociology claims to fulfill cognitive and managerial functions, as well as an ideological one, which is expressed in the formation of moral and social guidelines. At this point, there is a tendency to a methodological turnaround to the softening of the research style and toolkit in sociology today. The author shows that sociological knowledge is the intellectual vaccine of society against social regression despite its implicit application potential. The article also outlines the author's vision of the sociological reflection's role not only for "ordinary people", but also for sociologists themselves. Such a big attention to opposition between "sociology for sociology" and "sociology for society" is determined by the author's interpretation of sociology as a polyparadigmatic and multidisciplinary science aiming at solving the contemporary society's complex problems, including in equal measure the problems of scientific competition, cooperation, and career in the sociological community.

ID NUMBER; BIAS
AB In recent decades, political science literature has experienced significant growth in the popularity of nonlinear models with multiplicative interaction terms. When one or more constitutive variables are not binary, most studies report the marginal effect of the variable of interest at its sample mean while allowing the other constitutive variable/s to vary along its range and holding all other covariates constant at their means, modes, or medians. In this article, we argue that this conventional approach is not always the most suitable since the marginal effect of a variable at its sample mean might not be sufficiently representative of its prevalent effect at a specific value of the conditioning variable and might produce excessively model-dependent predictions. We propose two procedures to help researchers gain a better understanding of how the typical effect of the variable of interest varies as a function of the conditioning variable: (1) computing and plotting the marginal effects at all in-sample combinations of the values of the constitutive variables and (2) computing and plotting what we call the "Distribution-Weighted Average Marginal Effect" over the values of the conditioning variable.

AB Disputes in the field of science and technology studies (STS) demonstrate its topicality as they elucidate the prospects for a postmodern world, and William Lynch in his book, in search of a constructive solution to current controversies, employs the dialectical approach of Lakatos and Feyerabend. Lynch takes a bold step to present an apparently "degenerated scientific research program" as a competitive alternative to the established and "progressive" mainstream. The book offers not only a theoretical justification for this "minority report," but also its empirical confirmation, as well as the possibility of practical and socio-political application. We believe that Lynch's book actualizes the discussion about the nature of sociality as related to scientific cognition, as well as provokes the question of the possibility of specific ontology of scientific knowledge. However, the internal heterogeneity of the sociology of scientific knowledge seems to be slightly underestimated, which sometimes prevents Lynch recognizing his real allies and opponents in modern STS. Lynch's approach to analyzing scientific alternatives to dominant paradigms and to science communication practices helps problematize current controversies through demonstrating their incommensurability not incomparability. Hopefully this will increase their mutual understanding and collaboration.

AB Memory politics in post-Soviet cities is a growing area of research with significant political implications. However, there is still relatively little consideration of memory production in the sphere of tourism, particularly when it comes to the analysis of memory practices beyond official city branding. Focusing on the case of Almaty, Kazakhstan's former capital, this article puts forward a multi-actor analysis of memory-making in city branding, highlighting the frictions between the identity projects promoted by city authorities and private entrepreneurs. We show how tourism has become an important battlefield for the negotiation of ethnic hierarchies in the city.

AB The article aims to identify the methods and tools used by EU to counter the hybrid threats: from the fight against terrorism to measures aimed at combating economic competitors and political opponents (mainly, to squeeze Russia and China out of European markets). The author concludes that both EU institutions and the research community have not created a comprehensive definition of operations to combat hybrid threats, which is obviously not accidental. A broad understanding of hybrid threats as practically any (depending on the political conjuncture) actions of the opponent serves as a justification for the application of any counteraction tools. In the fight against global threats such as terrorism, cybercrime, and the spread of false medical data, the EU takes a systemic approach, which makes it possible to assess the level and degree of convergence of threats to critical infrastructure and the infosphere, as well as the possibilities of counteraction. At the same time, attempts to use economic, legislative, political and informational tools to achieve unilateral economic, political and military advantages do not reduce the degree of tension in the EU's relations with Russia, China, and some other countries only increasing the number and strength of hybrid threats. It reduces the EU's ability to achieve strategic autonomy.

AB The article provides an overview of the literature on conspiracy thinking. Although there is no consensus on the definition of this concept, as a rule, researchers pay attention to the following similar aspects: belief in secret and covert actions, a group of interested persons influencing world processes or hiding information about something, the false or implausible nature of conspiracy theories. There are two fundamentally different approaches to measuring conspiracy thinking: (1) in terms of agreement with several real conspiracy theories, (2) in general terms, without reference to specific conspiracy theories. Each of these approaches has serious limitations, both specific (for example, the arbitrariness of the choice of conspiracy theories for the first approach and the lack of one-dimensionality of the scales for the second), and general (the difficulty of using the scales in comparative international studies). The article provides examples of scales that correspond to each of the approaches. Factors influencing belief in conspiracy theories can be divided into psychological and social. Conspiracy beliefs are more common in people with high anxiety, low self-esteem and less developed analytical skills. In addition, conspiracy theories are more often believed by people with low social status and educational level, low level of generalized and political trust, belonging to the ends of the ideological spectrum, and consuming information from glossy magazines and social networks. The role of age and religiosity is less straightforward.

AB This article offers a comparison of sociopolitical instability forecasting systems. It compares systematically their efficiency by correlating their predictions for particular years with actual levels of destabilization in the respective years. It is demonstrated that the predictive capacity of those systems dropped dramatically after 2011. This is shown to be connected with the fact that the Arab Spring in 2011 acted as a nigger for a global phase transition, resulting in the World System making a transition to a qualitatively new phase, with the emergence of new patterns that are not taken into account by forecasting systems developed before its beginning.

AB Technology turned to be a virtual bedrock of the contemporary global economy. The prospects for successful overcoming of the multiple social, environmental, economic and geo-political strains that are challenging the future of the mankind mainly depend on the technological progress in all spheres of life. The development and large-scale introduction of qualitatively new, in many cases disruptive, technologies demand accumulation and efficient allocation of huge amounts of resources, primarily the financial ones. Since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 sovereign wealth funds proved to be some of the most well-capitalized institutional investors and substantially increased their role in the international economic architecture. Currently, total disclosed assets under management (AUM) of 95 active state-run funds are estimated at about 9 Trillion US dollars, which presents almost 10% of the total worldwide AUM. Even more importantly, thanks to the structure of capital and statutory mandates, they can take a longer view on value creation and, thus, on operations' planning as compared to venture funds, PE funds and other counterparts from the private sector. Far-reaching investment horizon is a feature that is critical and highly welcomed in such capital-demanding and volatile sphere as financing of innovations. According to available data, in recent years the leading sovereign wealth funds joined the global race in technologies and noticeably increased their investments in the technological sector, including transition to "green" economy, clean energy, digitalization of production, transportation and distribution, ICT-based services and business platforms. This trend can be traced since mid-2010s. Even in pandemic 2020 sovereign funds were most active in the technology sector (25% of all registered deals). The second and the third places were taken by services (including e-commerce infrastructure) and life sciences (vaccines): 18 and 17.6% respectively. This data is based on the analysis of 165 fresh annual deals worth 42 Billion US dollars. The sovereigns' trend to get closer to the technological assets (instead of traditional equities and mortgage) is being accompanied by greater in-house expertise and skills, general sophistication of strategies and operational management. This is especially true in cases of direct investments and access to early-stage technology-focused ventures. The empirical evidence allows to expect that in a foreseeable future the sovereign wealth funds will be steadily increasing their roles in financing of global innovations.

DT Article
DE Transbaikal; Russian-Chinese border regions; Soviet Chinese; 1930s;
   Bolshevik policy towards Chinese; political repressions
AB The article is devoted to the history of the Chinese population in the East Siberian border region with China, Transbaikal, in the 1930s. The particular position of this border region determined the specific formation of this Chinese population. The transfer of the Transbaikal region from the Far Eastern region back to the administrative unit of Siberia in the 1930s strengthened the Siberian regional features of the development of the Chinese community, and meant that the Far Eastern nationality policy was not applied to this community. The development of this community was influenced by the fact that in the 1930s, the state border with Manchuria was completely closed. The Manchukuo state, along with the Republic of China, had its official representatives in Chita. In the early 1930s the size of the Chinese population in Transbaikal reached a maximum, and in the Chita region its share in relation to the total population was equal to that in the Far Eastern regions. In the 1930s the working and living conditions of the majority of Chinese workers were difficult: they faced discrimination and were poorly adapted to the socio-political realities of Stalin's system. Initially the Bolsheviks carried out an active policy towards the Chinese that was aimed at their ideological and political re-education and the improving of their living and working conditions. In the second half of the 1930s, however, this policy changed, and political education and the development of a "Soviet Chinese" culture were no longer prominent. The Chinese began to be perceived as a national community disloyal to the Soviet regime, as real or potential agents of Japan and Kuomintang China. In 1936 began the "exposure" of Chinese spies, and in 1937-1939 the Soviet Chinese were fully subjected to the tyranny of the Soviet secret services and punitive agencies, and suffered greatly from political repression. By the late 1930s the number of Chinese in Transbaikal had decreased by almost a third; however, the situation was different from that in the border regions of the Far East in so far as there was no mass eviction of Chinese from the Transbaikal area.

DT Article

ID WORLD; AGENCY; NORMS; SOUTH
AB This article is aimed at the analysis of the perceptions of BRICS member states - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - on the role of BRICS as an actor in international politics. While numerous analyses of BRICS have already been provided, little attention has been given to the deliberate self-presentation of the group per country. As such, this work examines whether these countries themselves perceive the BRICS as a political body that offers an alternative to the Western political imaginary. The focus is on how the BRICS member states construct meanings of what BRICS is and put these perspectives into dialogue with each other. Through a critical discourse analysis, this work takes the official documents released by BRICS countries (e.g. texts and speeches) and examines how these documents reflect each BRICS country's perception of BRICS as a group. Findings show that despite BRICS' unified agenda and plans of action, considerable heterogeneity persists in the perceptions of each BRICS member country concerning the role of BRICS in the international community. The shared vision of the BRICS members remains reflective of the Western framework. However, while the BRICS bloc may not offer a full-fledged alternative politics to that of the West, it still offers an alternative reading of contemporary international politics. Considering also its current state as a group-in-progress, BRICS is significant for its adjunct role in global governance, not least through the differences between the countries and the uncertainty of its future, challenging how to examine historical transitions.

LA English
DT Article
AB This article examines the functioning of military power in the Petrograd garrison during the revolution of 1917. This problem is viewed as part of a study of the dual power system. Formally, all power over the soldiers in Petrograd belonged to the Commander-in-Chief and the headquarters of the Petrograd Military District. However, the conditions of the revolution created a new contact body between the Commander and the Petrograd Soviet called the Commander's Council. This body solved a wide range of issues, but mainly controlled the withdrawal of military units from the city. The history of the Council demonstrates the periodisation of dual power from February to October. At the beginning, mistrust, then cooperation, then an attempt by the military command to take all power into their own hands, and, finally, the struggle of the Soviet for complete control over the garrison, which ended with the October uprising. The article concludes that dual power in this period of political instability reduced distrust in the decisions of the military authorities. However, it took an effort on both sides to keep the system in balance; attempts to assume complete power led to an open struggle.

AB The article addresses political economy aspects of the policy of economic sanctions. Given the fact that decisions taken both in sender and target countries depend on the interaction of numerous groups of political and economic agents, sanction research can be productive only if their behavior is explicitly modelled given their objective functions and institutional context they face. It is shown that political economy approach can help resolve a number of paradoxes common in sanction research, i.e., paradoxes related to inefficiency of sanctions, pro-conflict reaction on sanctions by target countries, escalation of inefficient sanctions by sender countries, and retaliatory measures. Analysis shows that escalation of economic sanctions against the Russian Federation can not shift country's foreign policy in the direction preferred by sender countries. On the contrary, higher sanction costs for the Russian economy fuel domestic political support for current foreign policy decisions.

DE Maciej Gorny; Great War; War of the Spirit; War of patriotism
AB This review examines a monograph by Polish historian Maciej Gorny that examines the phenomenon of the "war of the spirit" in scientific discourse between 1912 and 1923. The "war of the spirit" is broadly understood as a reflection on national character in the context of the actualization of a clear distinction between one's community and that of the alien enemy, and narrowly as "an irregular cycle of outbreaks of nationalism in science, each inextricably linked to the horror of war, defeat and violence". The characters of the book are European intellectuals and the psychological, anthropological, and spiritual characteristics of warring nations, and the role of such sciences as geography, anthropology, psychology, and psychiatry in the "war of the spirit" is revealed. The Polish researcher points out the complex relationship between intellectual concepts and propaganda settings, believing that the phenomenon of "war of the spirit" is broader than the phenomenon of military-patriotic propaganda. The author of the review, while appreciating the work of his Polish colleague, believes that the study conducted within the methodological framework of intellectual history could have benefited if the methodology of the history of emotions had been used. The review points out that many of the marginalized concepts and stereotypes discussed in the book were typical for all strata of the warring societies, were based on archetypal images, and were fueled by emotions running high during the war. The author calls the "war of spirit" a natural state of a society for development of the main characterological images of "their own" and "alien" in the conditions of military and political conflict. Author points out that the concept of an ideological "war of the spirit" does not fully correspond to its content and considers it more accurate to speak of an emotional "war of patriotism".

AB The article examines the problem of risk reflections design based on the interpretation of risks and threats as a way of social order legitimization. Authors analyze the "cleavage" nature (in the terminology of Lipset - Rokkan approach) of the consequences of these designing. Using Paul Slovic "psychometric paradigm", theory of "sociocultural viability" by Aaron Wildaysky and Karl Dake, Paul Schoemaker expected utility model, prospect theory by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, Vincent Covello "mental noise" approach and Mary Douglas works on main risk cultural types, the authors suggest that, despite their heuristic capacity all these approaches, modeling of probable risk reflections is impossible without examination of the current political agenda, formal and informal practices of interpreting dangers and threats in public political discourse, as well as political goal-setting and elites intentions. These elements can weaken/strengthen, shift/replace risk reflections, which is critical for identifying key social polarizations ("cleavages") between "risk beneficiaries" and "risk outsiders". In this context, the article focuses to "administrative" failures in political risk management, the victim of which is often the whole society, but not just those who were originally nominated as consumers of risk. On the basis of the identified structural, actor-oriented and institutional factors of risk decision-making and the strategies for programming risk reflections by dominant risk producers, the authors conclude that errors in the design of risk reflections generate risk-anomie in the most vulnerable groups of the population.

AB The focus of the article is an analysis of the gender characteristics of perception and understanding of one's vulnerability to dangers, assessment of risks and threats, the level of security of the environment, the context of influence on political and social relations. The aim of the article is to identify the gender characteristics of the influence of "politically reflexive" risks on the nature of manifestations of political participation and to reveal the gender specificity of social mechanisms of the relationship between threat identification and various ways of participation (non-participation) in politics. The range of issues related to the analysis of the gender aspects of behavior and gender attribution in situations of threat / danger / risk is being problematized. The article presents the results of an all-Russian sociological survey conducted in 2020. According to the study, women are more likely to consider risks as an inevitable companion of human existence, and they feel much less safe. The gender features of the classification and ranking of threats and assessments of the reactions of Russian political institutions to them, their actions to manage threats and neutralize them are revealed. According to the survey, women are more inclined to believe that, when a threat arises, the authorities try to "hush it up", while men believe that the authorities shift the responsibility for solving "risk situations" to the population. The study revealed that women are more likely to choose milder forms of political action; men are more focused on participating in protests, including radical ones. The authors propose areas of research in the field of gender riskology - analysis of the gender features of behavioral strategies in situations of uncertainty and risk, gender differentiation of parameters of social acceptability of risk, gender aspects of various types of risk adaptations, gender component of political interests in riskogenic society.

AB In the last two decades, the internet has become increasingly important in political protests [Bronnikov, Gorbachev, 2021]. Internet communication technologies played an important role in the events of the Arab Spring (2010), Euromaidan in Ukraine (2013), protests in Iran (2009), rallies in Russia (2010-2011, winter 2021), unrest in Turkey (2013), protests in Belarus (2020-2021). These political phenomena had different causes, nature of the course, and results, but in all cases the communication possibilities of various Internet platforms - social networks and messengers - were used in one way or another, through which the function of horizontal coordination of protesters was carried out, a certain rhythm and direction of protest activity was set. Of the greatest interest in this respect are the telegram channels, which are able to maintain communication capabilities even during the state internet blackout. Their successful use by opposition-minded forces could be observed in autumn-winter 2020 in the period after the presidential election in the Republic of Belarus.
   The article analyzes socio-technological mechanisms of protest communication, used in the key opposition telegram channels of the Republic of Belarus.
   Analysis tools: "Orange" software package (used to analyze and classify information posted on the opposition Telegram channels in the Republic of Belarus), content and intent analysis tools (used for structural and content analysis of news posted in telegram channels), semantic analysis (to assess the quality of text content posted in telegram channels).

DE science; evolution; research programs; communication
AB A characteristic feature of the philosophy of science of the mid-twentieth century was a departure from the purely logical analysis of scientific knowledge and appeal to outer aspects of its functioning and development. A vivid expression of this turning point was the frequently repeated Lakatos's paraphrase of the Kantian dictum: "Philosophy of science without history of science is empty; history of science without philosophy of science is blind". The epistemological trend declared by Lakatos and presented in his works triggered a number of debates and discussions. Kuhn's position is especially representative in this respect because, due to his approach, the possibility of two versions of the historiography of science was clearly revealed. The first one, largely exclusive, is announced by Lakatos. Its essence lies in the developing of a logical mechanism which determines the character of changes of the processes of scientific knowledge. Appeal to the real history of science within this approach is set only by the needs of the verification of the "work" of the specified mechanism. The traditional (even for historiography) view on the ways of forming knowledge about history of science is presented by Kuhn. The events in the history of science need to be presented accordingly to the principle of how it was in reality. The form of such historiography is narrative. In general, Kuhn's epistemological model of science transffers the analysis of cognitive activities into the terms of communication inside the scientific community in synchrony as well as in diachrony. The article shows the consequences that can result from such an approach. Notably, the concept of scientific revolutions is becoming absolutely unjustified.

AB The acceleration and progress of science is connected in the article we are discussing by I.T. Kasavin with two factors: internal and external (with the cognitive problematization of available knowledge and the competition of the "institute of normal science and its social alternatives"). Moreover, each of them is interpreted as a condition for creativity and social freedoms. The article substantiates a somewhat similar view on an evolutionary-theoretical foundation. The development and progress of science is understood as one of the manifestations of social evolution, which is carried out in accordance with universal evolutionary mechanisms - (1) variability or variability, (2) environmental selection, (3) consolidation of new properties at some encompassing level. This allows you to look at science from the outside, from the perspective of an external observer who compares the progress in science and neighboring communities (in politics, economy, art, religion, where similar evolutionary mechanisms function). From an internal perspective, it is difficult to choose between vastly different understandings of scientific progress. Today, three main points of view on scientific progress are being debated: a problem-oriented approach in the style of Thomas Kuhn; the semantic understanding of progress as an approximation to the truth (verisimilitude) in the sense of Karl Popper and the epistemic interpretation of scientific development as the accumulation of ever new knowledge. However, none of these understandings conceptualize scientific progress as part of a universal social process, as a natural process of evolution. The mechanism of variability implies the formation of a pool of an excessive variety of scientific proposals (hypotheses, concepts, approaches, descriptions, explanations), which one way or another results in the appropriate communication formats or messages: in the form of preprints, conference abstracts, reports at scientific seminars, grant applications, etc. d. The question of their truth at this stage of the development of science has not yet been fully raised. And of course, only a little of this redundant supply will "get" to the second mechanism for filtering this diversity, namely, to the environmental selection of the most successful scientific messages for their truth or falsity. In science, this mechanism of diversity reduction is represented by the procedures of criticism, review, examination, verification experiments in other laboratories, etc.

AB Trends in the development of semantic theories of analytic philosophy and of theories of terminological planning are investigated. Addressing this issue is due to the need to identify the direction of the development of the semantic aspects of the language in the logical-cognitive, linguistic and social aspects on the example of theories of analytic philosophy and theories of terminological planning. The main lines of research on the semantic aspects of the language were associated with the areas of logic and linguistics, while the social factor was considered to a lesser extent. Turning to the sphere of terminology actualizes this aspect, since it is the need of society (societies) for integration that leads to the need to create this science. The development of theories of terminology (terminological planning) from the 1930s up to the present time reveals a certain parallelism in the definition of the meaning of a term in theories of terminology in relation to the meaning of a concept (word, linguistic expression) in theories of analytic philosophy. This parallelism in the definition of meaning conventionally lies in the fact that the initial theories of analytic philosophy (Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein (in the Logical-Philosophical Treatise period)) and the theory of terminological planning (the general theory of terminology by Eugen Wuster, the extended theory of terminology by Helmut Felber) are characterized by a prescriptive setting in relation to the parameters of establishing meaning for a concept (linguistic expression) and a term. The prescriptive setting of these theories is that in them the researcher prescribes the parameters that must be present in the meaning of a word (concept, term, linguistic expression), which, according to the authors, indicates a social factor of influence on the semantic process. Similar parallels are observed in the semantic theories of analytic philosophy and in theories of terminological development at further stages of their development, when it turns out that the prescriptive character acts as a requirement that cannot be met in the process of determining the meaning of a word (concept, term, linguistic expression). In this connection, in the theories of analytic philosophy (Wittgenstein in the Philosophical Studies period, Saul Kripke's theory of rigid designators) and in the theories of terminological planning (Maria Teresa Cabre's theory of doors), a descriptive approach begins to be applied. It consists in the fact that the meaning of a word (concept, term, linguistic expression) cannot be preset, but is established in the process of its application (at the very moment of use). In this case, the social factor of influence on the semantic process begins to be less controllable than in the case of its functioning as a prescriptive setting.

DE cluster; model structure; possible world
AB In modern logic, one of the main tools for clarification of modal operator's meaning is the so-called possible world's semantics based on the concepts of model structure, possible world, and binary relation of accessibility structuring a set of possible worlds. These concepts are considered to be a natural elaboration of certain methodological principles, which hark back at least to Leibnitz's philosophy and appear to be evident. However, in the author's opinion, their meaningfulness, justifiability and formal correctness can be called into question. For instance, an accessibility relation in the possible world's semantics is implicitly used as an analogue of a certain empirical procedure capable of discovering of some extra connections between possible worlds, which have not been caught initially in logical system axioms. According to the author, such a treatment is utterly incorrect. When constructing the original possible world's semantics, an accessibility relation in different systems was enriched with certain additional restrictions (reflexivity, transitivity, etc.) due to the specificity of modal axioms, not vice versa. That is why an accessibility relation, as well as all other notions of possible world's semantics, virtually remain formal and do not clarify properly the meaning of modal operators. An alternative method of semantic construction for some normal modal systems, which was firstly proposed by Yuri Ivlev, presupposes analyses of certain restrictions of possible truth-values of propositional variables of a formula with modal operators. As a result, some state-descriptions can be excluded from an initial state-descriptions set for the formula. Thus obtained clusters - restricted sets of state-descriptions and their ordered sequences - prove to be equivalent to model structures of possible world's semantics for Lewis's system S5, S4. and basic Heyting's system Int. Possible world is interpreted as a classical state-description. Cluster semantics rely on purely traditional notions of logical truth, falsity, logical indeterminacy of system statements, etc. Besides that, meaning of modal operators in these semantics is clarified by means of finite sets of clusters, whose effective enumeration can be implemented by linear arithmetic functions.

TI Politics and Perversion (Pier Paolo Pasolini's De Sade Today)
SO PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIETY-FILOZOFIJA I DRUSTVO
LA English
DT Article
DE fascism; politics; perversion; deviation; violence; torture; libertine;
   Pasolini; de Sade
AB The article attempts to examine Pier Paolo Pasolini's film Salo, or 120 Days of Sodom, not only as an adaptation of Marquis de Sade's work, but as a possible response to the problems of modern society, which reanimates fascism, no longer as political ideology, but as a "natural" form of contemporary human sensibility. Relying on his original "semiology of reality," the expression of which is cinema, Pasolini's film embodies the non-political logic of fascism as the logic of perversion, hidden behind the facade of political ideology. The article shows that Salo consistently contradicts the key principles of cinematic expressiveness of Pasolini's theory itself, which focuses on moments in which "reality" reveals itself (acting as life itself). As a result, the film connects the unconnected - the shock of scenes of torture and sexual violence with a cultural allegory that anesthetizes effect of visual violence. For Pasolini, both violence and culture are mechanisms for analyzing the ephemeral substance of power, which inevitably generates some form of fascism and perversion, while de Sade is the discoverer of the basic sensual (plastic) syntagmas of power, embodied in the figure of the libertine. The sadistic libertinage, which combines the idea of freedom and the practice of torture, finds itself at the very heart of contemporary politics, its operative unconscious.

TI COVID-Subsidiarity as A New Political Phenomenon
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

DT Article
DE COVID-19; pandemic; subsidiarity; power; megatrends; European Union;
   China; UK; political organization of the world
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly and synchronously changed the lives of billions of people all over the planet. The economic, social, and political problems were entwined in tight contradictions. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on international and national political issues has been the focus of attention of academia around the world since early 2020. The primary attention has been focused on international and national levels. At the same time, the subnational and local dimensions of the corona crisis "elude" the political science community.
   Nevertheless, fighting against the new biogenic danger changes the redistribution of power between the national, subnational, and local levels. The article analyses this redistribution and presents its preliminary due to the incompleteness of the pandemic results. It seeks to identify the main patterns of a new round of the evolution of subsidiarity associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. What role does COVID-subsidiarity play now, and what are its prospects in the post-pandemic world? The article employs the concept of megatrends and comparative methods to answer this question. The results show that extraordinary powers have been redistributed worldwide from the national to the subnational level. The essential characteristic of COVID-subsidiarity is the emergence of emergency powers at the subnational and local levels. It happens in states with different political regimes and different political cultures. It is likely that even after the end of the current pandemic, in some cases, the subnational regions will try to retain the expanded powers they acquired during the emergency. This is part of a broader process of transformation of the modern state and its adaptation to the newly emerging political organization of the world.

AB The article highlights and concretizes the historical conditions and factors of transformation that the regime of interaction between government and society in Russia underwent at the end of the 20th - beginning of the 21st century. These determinants have an economic, political and managerial nature. The corresponding transformational stages are distinguished: the stage of democratic transit (1991-1999), the stage of regime consolidation (1999-2008), the stage of political modernization (2008-2012), the stage of political-doctrinal and political--managerial inertia based on reasonable conservatism (since 2012) with a generalization of their system characteristics. The main trends and prospects for the development of the system of interaction between government and society are determined.

AB In the era of new challenges and threats, the most dangerous of which has occurred terrorism, the Republic of Turkey becomes one of the key centers of power in the Middle East and pursues the goal to create a regional security architecture around itself as well as to counter various terrorist organizations. The aim of the research is to scrutinize the peculiarities of Ankara's anti-terrorism policy both - inside and outside the country - and its political and legal approaches to understanding the phenomenon of terrorism and methods of its combating.
   The study of Russia and Turkey's aspects of interaction is of particular importance. This issue seems to be especially relevant in the scope of strengthening of Russian-Turkish cooperation in recent years including the field of combating terrorism, ensuring global and regional security, and maintaining international stability. As a result of quantitative content analysis of President R.T. Erdogan's public speeches and the use of general scientific research methods, the authors conclude that the fight against terrorist threat, especially the so-called "Kurdish terrorism", is a matter of great importance for the country's leadership. At the same time Turkey's anti-terrorist activity has certain specifics and is characterized by Ankara's desire to lead anti-terrorist missions in different parts of the world and using a predominantly militaristic approach to solving the problem. This approach primarily consists in conducting cross-border anti-terrorist military operations on the neighboring states' territories. However, the military campaigns that have become an integral part of Turkey's anti-terrorism policy in many respects do not contribute to the demolishing of terrorist elements. Instead of that such operations on the contrary become an extra destabilizing factor in the Middle East. Besides that, due to the peculiarities of Turkey's interpretation of the concept of "terrorism" and its policy's implementation, Ankara's foreign anti-terrorism actions in most cases are limited to the realization of its own interests but not to achieving the goals set within the framework of the ongoing campaigns.

The article uses the methods of induction and systemic scientific analysis, as well as comparative-legal and historical methods. The authors of the article proved that the implementation of the principles of local self-government in the Russian state apparatus became effective since it is based on objective economic, political and social prerequisites and conditions. As a result, all cities and rural settlements became municipalities.

   GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; CORRUPTION
AB The article verifies one of the principles of the gen-eral theory of social development, which is called the principle of consistency. According to this principle, the economic growth rate positively depends not only up-on the level of technological development, institutions, and culture, but also upon the degree of consistency between these factors. This hypothesis was tested by constructing econometric models on a sample of 154 countries. The output variable is the rate of GDP growth, and the ex-planatory factors are technology, institutions, and culture. To quantify the latter, the corresponding proxy variables were used: labor productivity, the Doing Business index, and the Corruption Perceptions Index. The constructed models are fixed-effect models, and the coefficients of the explanatory variables are determined by adjusting the variance-covariance matrices. Empirical evidence has con-firmed the validity of the principle of consistency for the group of "rich" countries with upper middle income, and have not been confirmed for the group of "poor" countries with lower middle income. The obtained result was inter-preted in terms of the concept of a narrow corridor called Acemoglu-Robinson, the concept of structural competi-tion and the theory of self-organization. It is shown that the consistency principle acts as a necessary condition for the appearance of the Red Queen effect in the Acemoglu- Robinson concept.

AB Despite the success in countering the online propaganda of terrorist organizations, such as ISIS, and a sharp decrease in the number of materials related to it in Russian social networks, Salafitization of the media space of Russian social networks remains at a high level. Many radical virtual communities that have retained their presence on social networks have managed to adapt to the strict rules of censorship and broadcast their ideological guidelines and communicative messages in a veiled form. An adequate assessment of current trends in the circulation of Salafi discourse online requires regular monitoring of social networks and the identification of new forms of representation of Salafi ideology. The article presents the results of a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the ideological discourse circulating in ten communities identified as Salafi in the VKontakte social network. The aim of the study is to thematize the textual content and media images that are produced and broadcast by the administrators of virtual communities, and to determine the reaction of the online audience to the published media materials. At the first stage of the study, a database of more than 2.5 thousand posts was created. These posts were retrieved with related statistical information using the API service of VKontakte. The posts were divided according to the relevance of the online audience (the main criterion is the number of likes) into three categories: low, medium, and high significance. A content analysis of posts of the three categories and a multimodal analysis of visual images (media images), the most popular and typical for the studied Salafi communities, were carried out. The main results of the study are as follows. It was found that, in the ratio of the segments of the various currents of Salafism (moderate, radical, and ultra-radical), a moderate form of Salafism plays a rather large role. Of the total number of subscribers of all communities, moderate Salafi groups cover 38% of the online audience. At the same time, regardless of the degree of radicalism of the broadcast discourse, the online audience sympathetic to the Salafi ideology is most interested in topics that are neutral in emotional tone and meaning. Posts with radical content do not rise above the segment of posts of low importance. The preferred type of images that accompany textual materials are neutral visual images, namely images (photographs) of nature. An analysis of the semantics of media images shows a shift in emphasis in the ideological discourse of Salafism from group mobilization to the intensification of individual religiosity.

DT Article
DE prediction of conflict; pre-cursor of conflict; socio-political tension;
   tension indicators; influence of immigrants on tensions; Arab spring
AB The method for predicting conflict events based on the assumption of an increase in socio-political tension in the last years before the event is applied in the article. The sum of murders and suicides was taaken as an indicator of socio-political tension. A linear regression built on the values of the tension indicator over the past six years was used to reduce the impact of random fluctuations. It has been hypothesized that an increase in tension of more than 5% over five years could be a precursor of serious conflicts. The method was tested in the Arab countries during the events of the Arab Spring. The study showed that the growing socio-political tension in the Arab countries in 2005-2010 was associated with the ratio of the immigrants' number to the permanent population. The share of immigrants less than 15% led to conflict, while that of over 15% reflected the tension of immigrants and, as a rule, did not lead to conflict. When using the suggested method for the Arab Spring events we are able to correctly predict the conflict in five out of six cases (probability of 83%) and a failed conflict was predicted in none of the cases. The accuracy of forecasts may be less for countries from other regions of the world while certain groups of countries may require additional indicators. It should be emphasized that the suggested method of forecasting might be used to predict unique conflicts.

AB The article presents the standpoint that naturalistic tendencies in modern science, which are especially expressed in neuroscience, push up social knowledge toward the need to revise its attitudes and norms, which consist in consistent sociocentrism and biopho-bia, and, hence, a simplified understanding of the phenomenon of "genetic reductionism". We show that the application of the methods of natural science to social disciplines often marked visi-ble progress and even conceptual breakthroughs in their develop-ment. Achievements of modern neuroscience affect a traditional area of social and humanitarian knowledge as political science, which leads to the formation of an independent area of re-search - political neuroscience. Through the optics of this re-search, cognitive styles characteristic of individuals and social groups with different value orientations imply the dominance of certain ideological sympathies and antipathies, which attributed to the opposite poles of the ideological scale - liberalism and conservatism. Considerable empirical material allows us to con-clude that these ideological positions are exist due to differences in their ontogenetic "foundations", which allows us to develop I. Kant's ideas about a priorism and transcendentalism in the con-text of the Kantian research program in contemporary neuro-science. The result of the implementation of this program to the political sphere was the discovery of the genesis of political views, and the demonstration of the peculiarities of their dynam-ics. They are based on the difference in the activity of certain neural sets, which in their turn are influenced by culture and soci-ety, forming an integral system "brain - culture - society", where each component of which affects other components. Features and changes in the socio-cultural context of the development of an individual or a group of people may have an effect upon the architectonics of the brain and shift, due to its plasticity, of the political views along the scale of ideologies "liberalism - conser-vatism". At the same time, carriers of different cognitive styles and, therefore, with a sufficient degree of probability of ideologi-cal views, percept the world in which they live in differently, and evaluate its past and possible future in diverse ways.

AB The presented research is devoted to the exploitation of the topic of anti-Semitism in pre-revolutionary Russia within the framework of constructing a negative image of the USSR by American filmmakers during the Cold War. The image of "Russian anti-Semites" has undergone significant evolution. Initially, the establishment, clergy and political leadership of the Russian Empire were identified as the driving force of repression and initiators of discriminatory practices. However, in the 1980s. "The image of the enemy" underwent primitivization, embodied in the image of a Cossack, corresponding to the archetypal ideas about "barbarians-destroyers".

DT Article
DE Sweden; total defense; strategic culture; Swedish Social Democratic
   Workers' Party; EU; NATO; pandemic; emergency; defense industry
AB The article deals with the 'total defense >> concept considering it to be part of Swe-den's strategic culture and provides an overview of how this concept defines Sweden's ap-proach towards the defense cooperation within the EU. 'Total defence >> remains staple in the Swedish defence planning and the perception of risks to national security, but has not yet received sufficient attention from Russian researchers. The announced restoration of the effective total defense system potentially comparable to that of the period of bipolar con-frontation is associated with significant difficulties due to the gradual reduction in defense spending after the end of the Cold War and the decentralization of the national crisis prepar-edness structures which was initiated in the early 2000s. The total defense itself also reveals tensions between the demands for consolidation and centralized decision-making and the liberal, open nature of the Swedish society and national economy, as well as the principles of responsibility, subsidiarity and similarity that underline the present Swedish emergency response system. The total defense, is, therefore, regarded as an attempt at creating an ef-fective crisis preparedness system that would function successfully in a democratic society, both under the conditions of peace and potential armed conflict, without the need to de-clare an emergency and endow individual bodies or a selected group of individuals with exclusive powers. The Swedish strategic culture, therefore, stipulates that it is important not only to resolve a crisis effectively, but also to do so in a way which would not endanger the regular functioning of political institutions and the rule of law. Within the EU Sweden has earned credit for developing civilian or non-military elements of crisis management, while 'more hardware >> defense cooperation within PESCO and the European Defense Fund is defined by the pragmatic economic interests of Swedish defense companies rather than by strategic considerations. The Swedish Experience with 'total defence >> will continue to face the same dilemma - the need to rebuild a robust and self-reliant national defence while preserving the liberal principles in politics as well as in economy.

AB The places of complex conjugation of the old and new nomenclatures of scientific specialties in law are determined. Based on the data on defenses for three calendar years (2019-2021), a forecast is made regarding the likely number of announcements on the defense of dissertations in the councils of the centralized system for awarding academic degrees in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the total number of announcements on legal specialties: "5.1.1. Theoretical and Historical Legal Sciences" (13.27%), "5.1.2. Public Law (State Law) Sciences" (24.57%), "5.1.3. Private Law (Civil Law) Sciences" (16.94%), "5.1.4. Criminal Law Sciences" (41.24%), "5.1.5. International Legal Sciences" (3.95%). The significant difference that will be observed in the number of dissertations defended in various legal specialties is emphasized. It is determined which merging of old legal specialties can give synergy and what dangers lurk in the past reform. The results of monitoring of the distribution between the system of centralized and autonomous awarding of academic degrees of defended dissertations in civil and criminal law are reported. A conclusion concerning the reasons for this distribution related to the field of cognitive psychology is proposed. According to the authors, the consolidation of scientific specialties, creating prerequisites for interdisciplinary research, can serve as a good basis for increasing the share of doctoral dissertations in law, taking into account the results of research in related fields (sociology, economics, political science and cognitive science). It is noted that the evolution of legal specialties should not be perceived by jurists in isolation, but in combination with other innovations in the nomenclature that affected the field of social and humanitarian sciences, and over time - the fields of natural, technical, medical sciences.

DE knowability; Fitch's paradox; epistemic logic; hybrid logic
AB Fitch's paradox shows that the concept of knowability is as problematic as the concept of knowledge. This is so because of the fact that the most natural logical representation of knowability as.K (in terms of bimodal logic containing alethic and epistemic modalities), taken together with some natural principles and assumptions, leads to contradiction. This paper is aimed at elaborating a formalization of the concept of knowability de re that should allow us to accept the principle of knowability de re without facing Fitch's paradox. (In my view, the concept of knowability de re and the concept of knowability de dicto should have different logical representations, and I leave the concept of knowability de dicto out of the scope of the paper.) I suggest a system of hybrid logic in terms of which knowability de re can be accurately represented; I call it HLK - hybrid logic of knowability de re. HLK is a modification of a system suggested by Kocurek in order to represent cross-world predication. Changes made by me affect definitions of term, model, and truth; I also add to Kocurek's logic the epistemic machinery. HLK includes two modalities - the alethic and epistemic ones - and its vocabulary contains hybrid items: possible world variables, two hybrid sentential operators, and a hybrid term operator. Thanks to the hybrid part of vocabulary together with relevant parts of syntax and semantics, HLK has a substantial advantage over standard bimodal systems in terms of expressive power. This makes it apt to express knowledge and knowability de re in a way that allows adopting the principle of knowability de re without facing Fitch's paradox. I describe the syntax and semantics of HLK, demonstrate its expressive power, define the HLK representation of epistemic concepts under consideration, and demonstrate on examples that the suggested representation meets their intuitive meaning.

AB In recent years, due to the digitalization of the economy, there has been a rapid development of online commerce around the world. China is a global leader in online trade; the country demonstrates the highest volumes of the online sales market. The Russian online sales market is the most dynamic, Russia ranks first in terms of the growth rate of online retail. Within the framework of this study, we analyze the current state of online retail trade in China and Russia over the recent years, assess the contribution of e-commerce to the retail turnover of the two countries, identify factors affecting the active and dynamic development of this sector and promising directions for further development of online consumption in the context of modern socio-economic transformations. In the course of the research, we have found that the successful development of online retail in China is the result of an effective system of political regulation and stimulation of this segment, constant expansion and improvement of Internet coverage, improvement of e-commerce infrastructure and people's financial situation. In Russia, the widespread use of the Internet, including on mobile devices, the transformation of consumer attitudes, requests and preferences, the increase in sales volumes of the largest marketplaces and online stores reflect large reserves and great potential for further growth and successful development of this sector. The main directions for further development of the e-commerce segment are as follows: improving the standard of living and quality of life, improving the infrastructure of online commerce, mainly in the direction of ensuring the security of online payments and other transactions, expanding the informatization of rural areas and their population, greening online consumption, improving the regulatory framework in the field of e-commerce.

AB Based on the works by English-speaking authors on the South Manchurian Railway published after 2000, the author explores the phenomenon of the Russian/Soviet presence in Manchuria and in East Asia. The object of study was under the jurisdiction of Russia for a short time, but remained a kind of barometer of the pre- and post-war regional order. This is due to the significant strengthening of Japan and the Japanese presence, so the "before - after" scheme is present in the reviewed studies, and the change in the disposition of the powers is one of the main narrative plots. A similar "before - after" scheme in a number of works reflects the transformation of the positions of individual Western scholars under the influence of the so-called "memory wars" against the background of changes in the system of international relations over the past 7-8 years. The works in question concentrate on those spheres of public life that were affected by the railway irrespective of its subordination. The conclusions of the article reveal that this topic is under-researched; that foreign scholars make little use of the Russian resources and the potential of Russian researchers; that some opportunistic studies seek to present Russia as an aggressor and an expansionist, and the imperial policy - as a failure and disaster for the region.

AB Global economic and political instability has highlighted the shortcomings of the current global economic system and reaffirmed the need for an alternative or complementary development paradigm. The Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) is a sustainable solution to rebalance economic, social, and environmental goals. The analysis of scientific literature demonstrates the actualization in the world academic discourse of the problem related to the social solidarity economy, part of which is the cooperative form of socio-economic organization.
   The article deals with an interdisciplinary study of the place and role of cooperatives in the structure of SSE (Social and Solidarity Economy), international experience of the functioning of cooperation as an organizational form that consistently implements the principles of a socially-oriented economy, its legal regulation, and the mechanism of updates in the socio-economic process. The differences between social cooperatives and other types of social enterprises in countries with successful economies are considered. The SSE essential features and their correlation with cooperative principles of activity are shown. Based on an analysis of world experience, various ways of providing and accessing financial resources to support the SSE organizations and their ecosystems growth have been defined.

DE youth; morality; political ideas; identification; "alien"; "own"
AB The article is based on the results of a study of the relationship between moral and political consciousness. The study was conducted to answer the questions of what factors determine the ideas of modern youth about the interaction of morality and politics, and how their ethical ideas affect the perception of political problems. The conceptual model of the study is based on the psychological understanding of young people's consciousness as a complex mental construct. Value orientations and ethical ideas existing in this construct's structure determine their attitude to politics. The empirical basis of the study was a questionnaire survey, focus group discussions, and expert interviews. The results of the survey show that, in the understanding of young people, moral norms should be the regulators of political relations. At the same time, the young generation's ethical ideas are abstract, poorly systematized, and largely dependent on a particular person's sociocultural or political orientations, which, in turn, are vague and fragmented. For the majority of the respondents, these orientations are based on very superficial knowledge about politics, political institutions, and specific political subjects. The perception of political events and processes, and the formation of their assessments from the standpoint of morality for young people occur on the basis of self-identification and categorization of socio-political subjects into "us" and "them". As a result, in assessing political events, the actions of politicians or citizens, the dichotomy "own" - "alien" or "we" - "others" comes to the fore. The declaration of any actions as moral/immoral depends on how a young person identifies oneself in relation to the subject of actions in social or political terms, whether this subject is perceived as conditionally "own" or conditionally "alien". For young people, "aliens" are often the authorities, their representatives, the state and its institutions, and "own" is an abstract image of the people, in a narrower sense, of people from their environment or politicians who declare support for the interests of the people (or society) against the state. The revealed tendencies in the formation of moral assessments of politics by representatives of the younger generation of Russians, together with the vagueness and fragmentation of their ethical ideas in general, can become the basis for active political manipulation, in which legal assessments are replaced by subjectively understood moral ones, and the arbitrarily understood significance of moral standards is used as arguments.

The socio- economic and political background that accompanied the census is characterized based on empirical material obtained by the authors during a series of focus groups on the key points of the censusist' work. A portrait of the census taker was compiled, an assessment was made of such conditions of his work as security, tools for providing. The key problem is highlighted - a low level of population loyalty to the census. The socio- demographic specificity of motives and the inequality of positions in relation to participation/ non-participation in the census of various groups of the population are presented. The adaptation strategies of census takers aimed at reducing mental and organizational difficulties, their occurrence in work were revealed. A general conclusion is made about censusists as a valuable object of research, a way of reflecting social problems.

DT Article
DE market of religions; state-confessional relations; religious monopoly;
   religious oligopoly; religious monopolistic competition
AB The article presents the attempt of using the marketing paradigm in the analysis of state-confessional relations. Considering such relations through the prism of market structures, the authors identify three main types: religious monopoly, religious oligopoly, and religious monopolistic competition. Religious monopoly implies the dominance of one religion, which enjoys the full support of the state that protects it from competition from other religions. In the modern world, religious monopoly exists in two forms - closed and open, with the differences between the two lying in the degree of monopolization of the market by one of the confessions. According to the authors' conclusion, the religious monopoly imposed from above (by the state) ultimately has a secular effect, reducing the level of participation of the population in religious activities and thereby weakening the monopoly of religion, which, in turn, can lead to the termination of state support for it. Religious oligopoly implies that several dominant religions or their branches that are equally supported by the state and have the same status compete in the market; the emergence of new ones is difficult (open oligopoly) or even seriously limited (closed oligopoly). Religious monopolistic competition is characterized by the inclusion in the process of competition not only of religions and their branches, but also religious denominations. Each of these "players" produces its own unique religious product and has relatively free access to the market of religions, which is almost not limited by the state. The proposed typology is historical in its nature, which makes it possible to predict the dynamics of state-confessional relations.

DE consumer society; aesthetic of consumption; neoliberalism; politics of
   time
AB The article analyzes consumer culture transformations in the works of Zygmunt Bauman. It examines the differences between social norms and the prevailing value systems of the 1960s welfare society and the 2000s neoliberalism - revision of social solidarity, the growth of hybrid identities and consumerist aesthetics, uncertainty and risk, as well as changes in temporal sensibility in contemporary society. Speaking about the culture of risks and insecurity, Bauman means not so much new local conflicts, the "shock doctrine" and the political "state of exception", but rather changes in self-identity, the boundaries of which are constantly revised, which provokes a feeling of precariousness, vulnerability, uncertainty. Consumerism has changed not only the cultural superstructure, but also the mechanisms of production of subjectivities and the entire system of space-time coordinates of our time. That is why radical neo-Marxist criticism of consumerism does not work today and even contributes to its adaptation at new markets - in Russia, China, Latin America. Consumerism of the 2000s increasingly transforms the legacy of the modern era (including the welfare society projects of the 1960s) into a popular rhetorical reference, a sought-after cultural commodity. The recognition that consumption has penetrated the very fabric of our everyday life, subjugated aesthetics and temporal representations, is important for understanding the situation of uncertainty, which is not only used by neoliberalism, but can also become the basis for other strategies of social and cultural development that are significantly different from the consumer ideal. Bauman speaks of this as a "future with a hope for change". On the other hand, the analysis of consumerism shows that the extremely wide spread of leisure practices requires in the future a rejection of the binary opposition of self and other, provoking segregation, conflicts, and violence, and not allowing to go beyond the culture of a consumer society.

   President; social sentiment; ruling circles
AB February 24, 2022, the President of the Russian Federation announced the beginning of a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine; this, in fact, became a Rubicon in the 30-year history of Russia's existence within the framework of the liberal-democratic development paradigm imposed by the Collective West. Six months have passed since the launch of the operation. During this period, Russian society has faced unprecedented sanctions pressure from the United States and NATO and the withdrawal of a significant number of large foreign companies from the Russian market; the situation in Ukraine continues to arouse significant concerns. Sociological surveys indicate that the majority of Russian citizens support the President and the goals of the special operation. However, representatives of different social strata react differently to the events taking place in internal and external political and economic life. The article analyzes trends in social sentiment and the level of approval of the President's work on the basis of long-term monitoring of public opinion conducted by VolRC RAS in the territory of the Vologda Oblast. We conclude that the broad strata of Russian society feel the effect of the measures taken by the RF President and the RF Government to mitigate the effects of sanctions pressure on the economy and the quality of life and improve the spiritual, moral and cultural atmosphere that corresponds to the goals of national development in the current geopolitical situation; the attitude toward the measures is reflected in the assessments of public opinion. Besides, relying on expert assessments and statistical data, we dwell upon the problem of whether the views of individual representatives of Russia's ruling circles and financial and cultural elites correspond to the RF President's goals to "build and strengthen Russia as a strong sovereign power", whose sovereignty "cannot be segmented or fragmented in the 21st century" as Vladimir Putin noted at the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum on June 17, 2022. That is, sovereignty must be complete, not only political, economic or military, but, first of all, spiritual, cultural and moral. To achieve the set goals of national development, it is necessary to change the elites in the system of public administration, economy and culture. It is necessary to move from the elite, which was formed during the period of the country's life in the framework of the liberalcapitalist paradigm before the special operation, to the elites that ensure the sovereign development of Russia based on traditional spiritual and moral values and social justice.

AB February 24, 2022, after the recognition of the independence of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic (February 22, 2022), Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine. The head of state noted in his address to Russians that the purpose of the operation was "to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kiev regime. To this end, we will seek to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation". The RF President's decision announced the beginning of a new stage in Russia's development in the 21st century and launched large-scale and irreversible changes concerning not only our country, but also the whole world. The global historical confrontation between Russia and the US-led NATO countries (between Russia and the Collective West) has entered an active phase, accompanied by a sharp aggravation of international political relations, sanctions policy, and armed clashes. We (relying, as usual, on expert opinions, official statistics and sociological surveys) express our own point of view on the events taking place in the world and in Russia, analyze their nature, causes, and implications.

DT Article
DE image of Japan; political caricature; newspaper "Soviet Siberia";

AB Political caricature is one of the most interesting historical sources for studying the formation of the image of an event or a nation. It is often in the caricature that one can trace the process of visualizing the "image of the enemy" in a particular state, which is deliberately constructed under the influence of various external and internal factors. A striking example is the Soviet political cartoon. The article is devoted to the study of the formation of the image of Japan in the political caricature of the Soviet Union on the example of the newspaper "Soviet Siberia" during the Manchurian crisis.
   The author insists that, in order to form the negative image of Japan by the means of caricature, old stereotypes about Japan which had emerged during the Russo-Japanese and the Russian Civil wars were used, including mass representations of the Japanese as carriers of such traits as belligerence, cruelty, cunning, and unpredictability.
   The study concludes that Japan was represented as an aggressor country, which, under the pretext of "self-defense", invaded the neighboring state in order to seize its territories, as well as an exploiter of the masses. Eventually, this formed the reader's image of Japan as an enemy state, conditioned a negative attitude towards the Far Eastern neighbor on the level of mass consciousness, and gave impetus to further anti-Japanese propaganda, which received special development in the USSR since 1933.

AB The article is devoted to the formation of the scientific path of academician paleontologist Dmitry Vasilyevich Nalivkin (1889-1982), whose youth was spent in the walls of the St. Petersburg (Petrograd) Mining Institute. The formation of his personality and the choice of profession was greatly influenced by his father, a mining engineer and his close friends, geologists, political views and the life position of his mother. The creation of the "image" of the geologist's profession was undoubtedly influenced by the socio-economic situation in the country at the end of the 19th century, the increased role and popularity of geological science, due to the need to study and search for minerals and years of study at the Mining Institute, the oldest technical university in Russia. The scientific activity of the young scientist begins in the 1910s with the study of brachiopods of the Middle Paleozoic, which is extremely important for understanding the origin and early evolution of almost all animal species.

AB The Asian countries, particularly Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar, have been witnessing impressive economic growth rates due to their trade performance in the international market. Although export-led growth assumption is functional in these economies, existing pieces of literature hardly considered them in their studies. Against this backdrop, the present study investigates the export-led growth hypothesis for four South Asian countries - Bangladesh, China, India, and Myanmar - covering country-specific different time ranges. This research employs the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach to co-integration and the MWALD Granger causality test to determine the causal relationship between variables. The results obtained from the autoregressive distributed lag method confirm the co-integration among the variables. In addition, the Granger causality test explores both the export-led and growth-led export hypotheses in Bangladesh and India as per the bidirectional causation between exports and economic development. Only the export-led growth theorem is relevant to China, and the growth-led export hypothesis is valid in the case of Myanmar based on the unidirectional causation between these variables. Therefore, any joint footstep of BCIM countries is critical to promoting exports by penetrating new destinations with diversified export goods and services. The obtained findings also indicate the potential for utilising these countries' unused resources to encourage exports to uplift the existing growth trajectory.

The idea of creating a Chorographic Commission became an important component in the complex of liberal transformations carried out in the country in the middle of the 19th century by a new generation of liberal figures who advocated the modernization of the socio-political and economic structure of post-colonial society.

TI TATARS OF THE JOCHID ULUS: THE FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN
   ETHNOPOLITICAL IDENTITY IN THE 13th-15th CENTURIES

   class; military aristocracy; nomads; Ulus of Jochi (Golden Horde);
   Chingisids
AB Research objectives: To analyze the processes behind the formation and development of the Tatar ethnopolitical community in the Ulus of Jochi in the XIII-XV centuries.
   Research materials: The author of the article examines a variety of sources that reflect the progressive development of the Tatar ethnopolitical community in the Ulus of Jochi during the XIII-XV centuries.
   Results and novelty of the research: The Tatars of the Jochid Ulus during the XIII-XV centuries were usually studied from a socio-political point of view, with little attention being paid to the study of mental structures. Nevertheless, the formation of the ethnopolitical community of the Tatars - something which determines the mental universe of the population of the Ulus of Jochi - deserves and receives here more intensive study.
   The Mongol invasion brought not only destruction to the countries of Eurasia, but also led to the formation of a new Mongol Empire, and at the end of the XIII century, the successor Chingisid states. In all these khanates, there was a process of formation of their statehood and ethnopolitical consolidation. In the Ulus of Jochi, this process was associated with the formation of the Tatar ethnopolitical community. It turns out that during the conquests of Chingis Khan and his heirs in different countries of Eurasia from the Near and Middle East to Central Asia and Eastern Europe, Tatars were present among the troops of the Khans, playing the role of a military aristocracy. Due to these objective and other subjective reasons, the Tatar identity became the leading one in the Jochid Ulus, manifesting itself in the ideas that the Jochid Ulus was a country of the Tatars, the term itself becoming synonymous with the military service aristocracy. Tatars were also understood as Turkic nomadic people with their own clan structure.

TI New trends in the activities of the periodical press of Tuva during the

SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE

LA English
DT Article
DE Tuva; periodical press; mass media; Perestroika; sociopolitical life
AB The article discusses new features of the activities of the periodical press in Tuva in the late 1980s - 1991. The main sources of the article are the records of the local authorities that were involved in the registration of the media, the materials of content analysis of the newspapers and survey of journalists and editors. The article shows that the transformation of the press in the second half of the 1980s began with an appeal to new topics the study and expansion of using of Tuvan language, national customs and traditions, increasing social problems. In the beginning of 1990, the Children newspaper in Tuvan language started to come out again after closing in 1959. That was initiated by the Tuvan national intellectuals and supported by the local authorities. After the 1990 release of the USSR law on the press and the adoption by the First Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR of the Declaration of Sovereignty, changes became more widespread and irreversible. Communist party and state control over the press of Tuva had been lost, and it began to acquire the character of a "fourth estate". Editors and local authorities became the founders of the former Soviet and new national newspapers, the content of publications became increasingly polemical and critical, themes of interethnic relations and national sovereignty of Tuva were raised and developed. New editions of universal and thematic content were emerging. However, many of them, having faced with material and financial difficulties during the crisis, stopped their publication. They remained in the history of the Tuvan press only as the separate scattered issues.The newspapers prioritized coverage of the work of the people's deputies councils and the draft laws which they developed, election campaigns at various levels, activities of new parties and socio-political movements, social and economic problems and ways to overcome them, issues of the Tuvan language and revival of traditional ethnic culture, topics of interethnic relations and repressions, and problematic appeals of citizens. A major determining factor in the development of the Tuvan press during this period was the interest of the readership in the ethno-cultural specificity of the region. Thanks to the active position of journalists, a number of important national draft laws were discussed in the press in the form of dialoguef, the status of Tuvan as the State language was legalized, and a national-regional component was included in the regional education system. During the aggravation of inter-ethnic relations in 1990-1991, the Tuvan press rebutted and criticized the biased coverage of events in the central and regional press, implementing the new function of the press to protect the national dignity and honor of the people of Tuva.

AB The article's aim is to consider Jakob Hacker's policy drift approach and present this promising and unrenowned approach to Russian social and political scientists and researchers. It explains institutional change in social politics with hidden efforts of obstructionist-policymakers to block adaptation of welfare state institutions to changing social and economic circumstances. Drift occurs when institutions or politics are deliberately held in place while their context shifts in ways that alter their effect. The very nature of American political institutions and political processes encourage drift and make obstructionist politics effective and favorable in terms of political costs. In such a political environment, opponents of popular and embedded welfare state institutions may find it prudent not to attack these institutions directly; instead they may impede their adaptation to shifting circumstances, remake those institutions ground-level operations or build new institutions on the top of them. The article carefully explains the policy drift approach: it investigates its historical and theoretical origins, analyze cases of U.S. welfare state retrenchment that gave rise to the idea of drift, enumerates the other ideal types of hidden welfare privatization politics besides the "drift" - "conversion" and "layering". Furthermore, it engages in critical discussions on perspectives of the policy drift approach's adaptation in empirical social and political studies. Since the policy drift approach emerged as special theory explaining only U.S. welfare state shrinking, it put to the fore a specific issue: could it be utilized as general theory for the same processes in another countries? The article argues that the answer is "yes" but that the approach is only reliable and valid for homological cases. Firstly, the article shows examples of extension of the drift theory's explorations in empirical studies. Secondly, the article demonstrates, that the drift theory could be extended beyond cases of bipartisan, pluralist democracies, since in the other regimes minoritarian lobby-coalition can opt for drift strategy and obstructionist politics against reformist efforts of the majoritarian one, or vice versa.

TI The Lenaian Festival at Classical Athens in Sociocultural Context
SO VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA
LA English
DT Article
DE Ancient Greece; Athens; Lenaia; theatre; religious festivals;
   Aristophanes
AB This article covers the Lenaia (Atjvata) which was an important part of social and political life in Classical Athens. Our understanding of how dramatic agones in Athens were organized primarily comes from the accounts of the Great (City) Dionysia, while other festivals have been studied less thoroughly. The unique nature of the Lenaia manifested itself both in the purely theatrical and in the social aspects of the event. Regarding the leading theatrical genre, tragedy, the Lenaia remained in the shadow of the City Dionysia, playing the role of the "small stage". The comic agones at the Lenaia, on the other hand, were staged to a very high standard, to which the social aspect further contributed since the audiences at the Lenaia were much more down-to-earth, animated and active that at the Dionysia. The Lenaia was held during the coldest part of the year. It was precisely in winter when peasants from different parts of Attica, who constituted the majority of the Lenaian audience, were less busy with farming; unlike the Great Dionysia, the Lenaia was not attended by foreigners. The Lenaian festivals were held on a less lavish scale, their organization was entrusted to less significant magistrates, and their performances were much less costly than the Dionysian ones. The Athenians must have considered the Lenaia a predominantly peasant festival, inaccessible to outsiders. Lenaian performances were but little affected by "political correctness", their earthy humour at times evolved into biting political satire. All of the above created a special atmosphere that became the background of Aristophanes' best comedies.

DT Article
DE tradition; values; modern Russia; intellectual elites; political elites;
   political use of tradition; mass consciousness
AB The author sees tradition as a special type of human interaction, typical of modern and changing societies rather than of traditional ones; for that reason, his focus is on its use as a category of political struggle and as an instrument of power. There are four strata of modern Russia, and tradition has its own modus operandi in each of them. These groups are the scientific community, the intellectual elites (reflexive and functional), the political elites, and the masses (the latter covering all groups not belonging to the listed above). The scientific community generally adheres to the ethos of professional neutrality. Intellectual elites produce more-or-less politically-biased interpretations of tradition, guided both by their moral pathos and by their contractual obligations to the political elites. The latter use tradition directly as a tool of political governance. Such use is (a) instrumental, (b) quite indifferent to the content of those policies and courses that are intended to serve, and (c), quite indifferent to the authenticity of the tradition as such. However, the effectiveness of these impetuses from the elite directed at the masses remains highly questionable. Until recently, no research has been conducted to find out what the Russian masses consider to be traditional, and how positively this tradition is perceived. The situation has only started to change in recent years, thanks to the work of the ZIRCON group. For the time being, however, it is not known to what extent resorting to tradition (that is, to the kind of substantivized speculation that is suggested to be seen as tradition) could play in the integrating and legitimizing role which the political elites expect from it.

ID DISCRIMINATION
AB In recent years, sport reflects the most painful trends in social development, economics, culture, and international politics.
   Major international sporting events of the summer 2021 reveal, according to authors, the crisis of Olympism and degradation of the ideological and philosophical basis of professional sport, which is an important element of international relations undergoing a noticeable transformation under the influence of the coronavirus pandemic and the exacerbation of racist traumas of the past.
   The study is based on social constructivism, it uses elements of critical discourse analysis and comparative analysis. European Football Championship and Olympic Games in Tokyo 2021, FIFA 2022 qualifiers show some politically motivated refereeing, as well as bursts of racism on the part of individual participants. The principle of "political correctness" widespread in the West makes it difficult to discuss and deal with historical and colonial traumas, as well as with the crisis in the values of "fair play" in professional sports, caused by its commercialization and politicization.
   The article concludes that the observed facts stem, among other things, from the revival of the Black Lives Matter movement in the spring of 2020, which spread beyond the borders of the United States, the formation and expansion of the"cancel culture; as well as the growing influence of social networks and media on world public opinion.The coronavirus pandemic, announced in the spring of 2020, has exacerbated old national problems, and brought to the fore new phenomena in world sports.

The article argues that theories of res publica give us a particular insight. Paradoxically, Lucretius rather than Cicero might be our best start - in particular, his notion of foedera naturae (laws or pacts of nature). A pact that natura gubernans concludes with atoms is formulated in the lan-guage of Roman politics of the republican era and it brings the issues of shared sover-eignty into the forefront of discussion.

It is stored in the National Archives of the Re-public of Tuva. As part of the fonds, 196 units have been systematized and grouped into four sections: "Personal documents", "Creative documents", "Documents on official activities", "Documents collected by the creator of the fonds".The personal documents consist of autobiographies, characteristics and educational records, creative documents, i.e. pub-lished books and drafts of works. The most extensive section includes documents concerning official activities. It reflects the longstanding work of D. K.-Kh. Oorzhak in Komsomol and party bodies of the Tuvan ASSR. Numerous texts of speeches, entries in work logs allow a researcher to deal with the atmosphere of Soviet construction. The section "Documents collected by the creator of the fonds" comprises photographs that help to visualize the age. One can see people, meetings with collectives, various objects on the territory of the Republic.

DT Article
DE Spain; European Union; post-industrial era; new forms of employment;
   precariat; party-political system; social protest
AB The post-industrial era that the modern world ushered in has radically changed the labor market structure. The share of population employed in primary (agriculture) and secondary (industry) economic sectors has noticeably decreased while the third (services) and fourth (education, science, and healthcare) sectors have gained significance and increased shares of employment. However, unlike the first sector and especially unlike the second sector, in which labor is almost always systemic, the third and fourth sectors possess a huge demand for unstable (flexible, unsustainable, atypical) forms of employment. Therefore, the social structure of the society has witnessed the emergence of a massive layer of population who is not permanently employed. This is the so-called precariat, deprived of stable social guaranties that the workers enjoyed in the industrial era. In this context the case of Spain is of interest, since it outpaces the majority of the European Union countries in terms of the share of atypical employment. The precarization in this country leaves a deep imprint on various spheres of the society, including the party-political system. Precariat demonstrates a whole gamut of reactions to the surrounding world - ranging from extreme apathy and alienation from the political system to different forms of activism. Nevertheless, the precariat is far from turning into the "class for itself", as it does not have a specific political consciousness. Without making political demands and lacking organizations that promote their interests, the politically active precariat frequently uses new types of social movements organized by social networks in order to express its discontent. The Spanish experience demonstrates that, in general, unstable employment becomes a source of societal risks. The reduction of the scale of such employment is the imperative for that part of the ruling class that is seriously concerned with the nefarious implications of mass precarization.

TI The police state as a symptom: German classical philosophy and modern

AB The article considers a little-known topic in the history of the social thought, which has regained relevance under the pandemic - the discussion between the outstanding philosophers of the German idealism on the conceptual interpretation of police as an early-modern form of biopolitical control. In the introductory part, the author argues that the critique of the science and practice of policing by the classics of the German idealism is paradigmatic for the present-day study of the new/old functions and powers of the sanitary-police state concerning the modern civil society's self-reflection. In the first part, the author describes the tension between the Enlightenment philosophy and the 'science of policing' developed by the Cameralists of the 17th-18th centuries, and emphasizes the significant intellectual contribution of the Enlightenment thinkers, primarily Kant's legal doctrine, to the radical innovations in the political semantics at the turn of the 18th-19th centuries. Such innovations became the philosophical basis for the rule of law which questioned the discourse of the absolutist state control over its subjects' welfare by means of police. In the second part, the article presents a brief reconstruction of Fichte's attempts to combine the old Cameralist ideas with the new modern principles of individual freedoms at the end of the 18th-century era of the science of police - after Kant's explicit criticism of the state care unauthorized from below. The third part of the article focuses on Hegel's critique: in the history of the political thought he was often considered an apologist of the authoritarian Prussian state, but questioned the very possibility of the police-scientific idea of the total biopolitical control over social and economic activities of free modern-type individuals. The author reconstructs Hegel's argumentation of the absurdity of the total sanitary-police regulation as suggested by Fichte, and insists on the relevance of these thinkers, concepts and thematic fields for reconsidering the failure of the Early-Modern biopolitical utopia under the current intersections of lockdowns and sovereignty.

TI ONTOLOGICAL PROBLEMATICS IN SOCIOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION: TO THE QUESTION
   STATEMENT
SO SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE sociology; science; ontology; epistemology; social cognition; social
   sciences
AB Is the ontological issue recognized in contemporary sociology? If it is denied and left "at the mercy" of social philosophers, then this state of affairs provides a serious argument for positivists and supporters of the "unscientific" sociology. At the same time, at best, sociology lowers its status to descriptive-phenomenological, extra-scientific and, possibly, everyday (routine) knowledge. In the worst case, we will talk about specialized techniques and technologies that are used for their specific purposes by pollsters, market experts and political strategists. If the problem of ontology is interpreted as the recognition of the special and independent existence of the studied reality, then the question of the relationship between epistemology and relativistic (multiple) ontology comes to the fore. At the same time, the reality becomes independent of the researcher and is represented by the aggregate consensus (professional) discourse in which the sociologist is "immersed". Thus, sociology confirms the status of modern scientific knowledge about society and about social processes in it. The article shows that in theoretical sociology, ontological problems necessarily smoothly pass into epistemology, and begin to "dissolve" in value-historical coordinate systems. For its part, epistemology constructs a new reality that acquires ontological foundations. In the mutual transitions of epistemology and ontology, a blurred border of "inhuman factuality" arises (P. Berger, T. Luckmann). A hypothesis is formulated that within these continuous transitions a variety of linguistic realities actively interacts among multiple phenomena of everyday life and a diversity of scientific - specialized (professional) sociological discourses.

DT Article

AB The article discusses the history of the communist memorial project, with Vladimir Lenin at its core. A theoretical framework is based on the concepts by Pierre Nora ('sites of memory') and Jan Assmann ('cultural memory' and 'communicative memory'). The data sources are public opinion polls, transcripts of state officials' speeches, media coverage, and expert interviews conducted by the authors themselves. The cult of Lenin, which was important for the formation of Soviet identity, was sometimes an outcome of conflicts and compromises, employed in the most unpredictable ways. Opponents and open adversaries of the communists indirectly participated in its construction. The authors offer their explanations for the fact that today the memory of both Lenin and the Revolution is not perceived as a viable resource by any prominent political actor in Russia. Contemporary Russian society is divided in assessing Lenin's historical role, but the majority of citizens oppose the dismantling of the Soviet memorial project. The memory of Lenin is associated not with historical events, but with the Soviet memorial project instead. The "anti-revolutionary consensus" also influences attitudes towards this memorial project: the majority of Russians reject the revolution as a country's prospect, they also reject symbolic politics regarded as revolutionary. This also blocks the radical dismantling of the Soviet memorial project. Lenin and the 100-year-old revolutionary events do not evoke vivid and strong emotions, unlike memories of repressions or the Great Patriotic War.

DT Article
DE John D. Caputo; weak theology; theo-poetics; sovereignty; justice;
   Kingdom of God; sacred anarchy; insistence; call
AB The paper is devoted to the political dimensions of John Caputo's "weak theology". We analyze his understanding of the weakness of God and trace the evolution of his theo-poetics as an adequate method of theological hermeneutics. We argue that in Caputo's early works, theo-poetics is based on the Kantian reading of Derrida; this means the opposition between faith and knowledge, and emphasizing the undecidability. The political implications of a theology which is focused on the "God to come" are linked to messianic hope, and the promise of an event of justice. At the same time, justice is not interpreted as a thing that exists in the present or foreseeable future. Caputo proclaims the non-programmable future of event: justice "to come", democracy "to come", or hospitality "to come". In later works, Caputo turns to Hegelian theo-poetics based on the concept of Vorstellung. It focuses on the world-life and the event of poieisis.The ontological aspects of the new mode of theological thinking are characterized through the transition from God's existence to insistence. We analyze the concept of the Kingdom of God as "sacred anarchy", and indicate that this Kingdom establishes the order that is opposed to hierarchical logic. The interpretation of the Kingdom of God based on the radical theology of the cross characterized as the deconstruction of the metaphysics of power, the mythology of the higher heavenly powers, and the politics of sovereignty. The ethical and political implications of the concept"Kingdom of God" are analyzed as a pragmatic and prophetic transformation of the world. We argue that the theo-poetics of the sacred anarchic Kingdom is a way of thinking on the hyper-reality of the impossible in the real world. The "politics of the cross" that is presented in the last works of Caputo can thus be characterized as a project of actualization and materialization, that is, the material embodiment of God in the world.

AB The article is devoted to the theme of the Soviet past in the 2021 Duma elections. The author shows that, in comparison with 2016, the relevance of this topic has not decreased, but has in fact increased. While in the previous Duma elections the confrontations on the issues of the Soviet past dissolved into broader cleavages, this time they manifested themselves very clearly.
   The author documents the change in the structure of the confrontations on the issues of the Soviet past. If a year earlier such confrontations ran along the lines of "Communists vs. Anti-Communists" and "Liberals vs. Statists", in 2021 they rather went along the lines of "Defenders of the Soviet period vs. its Critics" and "Reds vs. Whites", with communists surpassing liberals and assuming the leading role in such confrontations. The author explains this shift by the growing importance of the topic of the Soviet past in the interparty discussion, because it is the communists who are its main promoters and beneficiaries.
   The article reveals that the confrontation "Defenders of the Soviet period vs. its Critics" quite convincingly explains the second electoral cleavage. In one of the models, it even displaces the general confrontation between liberals and conservatives in the worldview issues.
   The use of an alternative methodology based on a double factor analysis allowed the author to detect the opposition "Communists vs. Liberals", as well as an additional one associated with the special position of the Liberal Democratic Party on the issues of the Soviet past. These confrontations colored a number of electoral cleavages, including some of those that otherwise would be impossible to interpret politically.
   The author interprets an increase in the importance of the Soviet past in the mass consciousness as the evidence that the process of "Left vs. Right" confrontation shifting from the socio-economic area to the socio-cultural one, which is typical for the European and North American democracies, has partially affected Russia.

DT Article
DE Hegel's philosophy; Phenomenology of Spirit; natural consciousness;
   experience of consciousness
AB The article examines the problem of the structure of the subject of "experience of consciousness" in Hegel's "Phenomenology of Spirit". The author analyzes the relationship between "natural consciousness" (the "living" consciousness of an individual) that performs random experiences and the transcendental subject. In the structure of the transcendental subject there is the fundamental difference between "observing consciousness", which Hegel designates as "we", and consciousness as the subject of consideration. Although in the experience of "Sense-certainty" natural consciousness discovers the universal, and not the individual, which it held on, as its truth, it continues to be a necessary participant of experience. At each step of experience, the phenomenologist is identified with "observing consciousness", while the changing content of natural consciousness acts as a subject of consideration. The movement of experience is guided by the "observing consciousness", which sees not only the content of natural consciousness, but also the process of the emergence of its objectivity. The natural consciousness perceives this path as the path of "losing oneself', although in reality it is also the path of its "cultural development". The life of natural consciousness forms the "texture of history" as a prerequisite for the formation of the self-consciousness of Spirit. The unity of natural consciousness and the transcendental subject is restored in Absolute knowledge. The historical existence of Spirit in time coincides with its comprehension in the "scientific process". The conceptually grasped history becomes the starting point of speculative philosophy, and the achievement of this outcome is possible only as a result of the interaction of natural consciousness and the transcendental subject. In "Preface" Hegel returns to this topic in the context of demonstration that concept is an adequate form of philosophical knowledge, since the rational and discursive nature of philosophy corresponds to the historical dynamics of phenomenological experience.

AB Since 2009, UNESCO has published Global Reports on Adult Learning and Education (GRALEs), integrating an analysis of member-states' reported national data, policies and best practices. These reports focus on five action areas adopted in the Bel & eacute;m Framework for Action (policy, governance, financing, participation and quality), constructing adult learning and education as a policy object on a global level and strengthening UNESCO's role in the field of adult learning and education policy, particularly in terms of conceptualisation and in setting political priorities. Using the policy analysis framework by Lima and Guimar & atilde;es (2011), this paper analyses the conceptual elements and political priorities of the four GRALEs and the latest national reports of Nigeria, Russia and Slovenia. Main findings indicate a discrepancy between conceptual elements and political priorities at both global and national levels, where GRALEs are observed to be closer to the democratic-emancipatory approach and national reports to the modernisation and state control approach.

Shchavelev, senior researcher of the Institute of world history at the Russian Academy of Sciences. Reviewer analyzes the heuristic potential of the analytical chronotopography and Shchavelev's model of the social and political genesis of the Rurikid Polity. Based on the comparative anthropology and critical source studies, A. S. Shchavelev proposed a fundamentally new approach to solving the key issues of Old Russian politogenesis: how was the Rus' formed in time and space? How did its borders change during the 10th century? How was its managed?How was its connectivity ensured in the vast and sparsely populated area between Kiev and Veliky Novgorod? Reviewed monograph makes a fundamental contribution to a new round of world discussion about the processes of political genesis on the medieval Europe's periphery, especially in Scandinavia, the Baltic region and Rus'.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA
AB The article "Political Parties in Search of the Youth" is devoted to the analysis of political parties' activity in social media during the 2021 election campaign to the State Duma. We have studied parties' actions in eight social media: Facebook, VK, OK, Instagram, Telegram, TikTok, YouTube, and Twitter. A total of more than 1.5 thousand accounts were analyzed. It was found that those parties that were most active in social media got the best results in the elections. There was a contradiction between the parties' efforts to build an audience in social media and the methods they used to disseminate information. Many used methods belonged to the "old school", or were associated with attempts to use the authority of the offline leaders, the discourse actively used clerical language, which led the youth to unfollow. To change this situation, parties are beginning to actively involve young people in their headquarters to work in social media. Election campaigns are becoming hybrid, mixing old and new forms, introducing gamification and politainment. Results of the research have led us to the conclusion that the role of young people in election campaigns has changed fundamentally: from passive statists they become trendsetters, and life- wise politicians turn out to be their followers, imitating and copying the behavior patterns of 20-year-olds.

DE Vladivostok; Japan; public opinion; Russo-Japanese relations
AB The article analyses the modern perception of Japan by Vladivostok citizens as well as their views of the current state and prospects of Russo-Japanese relations. The research is based on the materials of a survey conducted by the Public Opinion Research Laboratory of the Institute of History of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences in May-September 2021. Obtained data correlate with the results of similar studies of previous years, which the laboratory conducted in various parts of Pacific Russia. The citizens' perception of Japan is compared with their views of other countries that are significant for Vladivostok and Pacific Russia, namely, China, the USA, India, and the two Koreas.
   The authors note that, as the Japanese factor played an important role in the history of Vladivostok, this country attracts special attention of the city's residents. In their opinion, the high level of attractiveness of Japan in Pacific Russia and Vladivostok as well, which, over the past two decades, has been recorded by public opinion polls, is based, first of all, on the people's interest to its unique culture, their high assessment of the substantial level of economic and technological development of Japan and the welfare of the Japanese people. However, the historical experience of Russian-Japanese relations and political contradictions between the two countries force a large part of the respondents (about a third of their total number) to believe in the existence of threats to Russia from Japan, which are naturally identified with the territorial claims of the latter. Nevertheless, the residents of Vladivostok, for the most part, show a fairly high level of trust towards Japan, positively assess the quality of modern Russian-Japanese relations and their future, and advocate for their active development.

ID ECONOMIC SANCTIONS
AB The article addresses behavioral strategies of top Russian entrepreneurs operating in the export and resource sectors in the context of comprehensive sanctions imposed by Western countries. The choice of behavioral strategy is considered in the context of two types of networking that have developed in the post-Soviet period. The first type of networking implies the involvement into the inner economic chains supported by the ruling group. In the second type of networking, the participants are involved into global value chains (GVCs). Two framework strategies of behavior emerged after the first "wave" of sanctions imposed in 2014. The first strategy was adopted by top entrepreneurs who have deep friendly relations with the "ruler". The proponents of this strategy, being supported by the ruling group, transformed into the operators of quasi-public resources with the minimum dependence on GVCs. The second strategy was formed by the owners of Alfa Group who sought to emphasize their political neutrality. The imposition of sanctions in 2022 showed that the first strategy was productive. Meanwhile, the strategy of Alfa Group members turned out to be a failure - the entrepreneurs were not protected from the Western sanctions and devalued their position in the Russian power vertical. Since the amount of resources distributed by the ruling group is limited, the strategy of the Russian top entrepreneurs is based on finding the balance within the two types of networking

AB The article analyzes in detail the preparation, progress, results and consequences of A. I. Mikoyan's visit to Vienna on April 23-27, 1957 showing a wide palette of trade and economic relations between the USSR and Austria during that period of the Cold War. Based on the preparatory documents of the Soviet party-state apparatus stored in Russian archives and for the first time introduced by the author into scientific circulation, the article reveals the political ingredients that went into the preparation of the visit and the nuances of bilateral relations between the USSR and Austria in the period after the XX Congress of the CPSU and the Hungarian crisis of 1956. Also, a number of hypotheses were made as to the implicit topics of the negotiations in Vienna, which gave a political connotation to the decisions on trade turnover and related economic subjects. Finally, the chain of subsequent decisions of the Soviet party-state leadership, adopted in the wake of the agreements reached by A. I. Mikoyan in Vienna, already in the second half of 1957 and in 1958, is traced. The author comes to the conclusion that the history of A. I. Mikoyan's visit to Vienna in April 1957 can serve as a tool for analyzing the entire set of trade, economic, as well as political and diplomatic relations between the USSR and Austria, both at the bilateral and multilateral levels (the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, "world socialist system", etc.). For Austria, the visit was an important milestone in the normalization of relations with the Eastern superpower and the implementation of its neutral status in exchange for economic concessions from the USSR.

AB The article analyzes the epistolary collections of Late Antique authors of the IV-VI centuries: Ausonius, Sidonius Apollinaris, Ruricius of Limoges and others. These representatives of the Late Antique intellectual elite got a brilliant education, and were engaged in literary activities. The epistolary genre was popular among the highest aristocracy not only as a means of communication at a distance, but also as a field for manifesting its education and literary talent. Epistolary contacts connected various regions of the Mediterranean world into a unified network, the members of which supported their Roman identity ("Romanitas") using a set of rhetorical rules and techniques. The purpose of this study is to reveal the literary trope "captatio benevolentiae" expressing the writers' desire to belittle their merits. This rhetorical technique was used to win favor with the audience due to the authors' modesty and to motivate the addressee to continue the epistolary dialogue. Lowering the level of their talent and education, as well as the quality of the texts, the authors of the letters forced the interlocutors to refute unfair self-assessment, thereby, maintaining epistolary communication and social ties, as well as forming a closed, elite community of like-minded people distinguished by a refined culture and high level of education and, thus, differentiating themselves from the masses of common people and barbarians.

DT Article
DE Eastern question; Slavophilism; empire; Lamansky; civilization;

AB The article deals with the views of the largest Russian Slavist Vladimir Ivanovich Lamansky (1833-1914) on the Eastern Question. Both his published works and manuscripts are used as sources. It is noted that Lamansky, on the base of the ideas of Slavophiles, formulated an origi-nal civilizational and political-geographical doctrine, which was developed in the concept of Eurasians. It is pointed out that the specific feature of Lamansky's approach was a broad philosophical-historical and global-historical view at the Eastern Question. He showed that the significance of the Oriental Question was not limited to the rivalry with Turkey, liberation of the Southern Slavs, capture of Constantinople, and control over the Straits. According to Lamansky, the Eastern Question is an issue of civilizational rifts in Eastern Europe and Asia Minor that lead to the confrontation of two civilizational worlds: the Germanic-Romanic and the Greco-Slavic or the Middle World. The main boundaries of Greco-Slavic civilisation co-incide with the borders of the Russian Empire, but the western boundary of this distinctive world remains unstable. Its definition constitutes the main content of the Eastern Question. The political configuration of the Greco-Slavic civilisation corresponds best to the idea of a unified Christian Empire, allowing for different forms of government on different territories. However, the Russian state, as the largest representative of the Middle World, realized a differ-ent type of empire - a Europeanizing state, which does not correspond to its global-historical task. The Eastern Question, therefore, was aquestion issue of mutual relations between the Germanic-Romanic and the Middle Worlds. Lamansky argued that its solution could not be purely military. A favourable resolution of the Eastern Question for the Middle World would be a consequence of its successful internal development

Contradictions between security services on this question,objectivated by the experience of the Irish war of independence of 1919-1921 took for granted asreferenced, led to the articulation and promotion of different models of counterinsurgency instead ofthe unified "British way" of resolving that problem. In the light of this the research contains ananalysis of the "guerrilla warfare concept" evolution within the military thought in the second halfof the 1930s, reflecting different thoughts on interrelated problems of the "revolutionarymovements" and "sub-war" on the overseas territories, including Palestine. Particular attention ispaid for military and political incentives and constrains of the counterinsurgency doctrine, reflectedbureaucratic logic which stood behind the implementation of the guerrilla warfare concept at thelevels of doctrine and theory in the context of the systemic crisis of empire and the growth ofexternal pressure over the questions of the imperial defense and self-determination for the colonies.

AB The paper presents an agent-based model for dissemination of norms and values and the experience of its use for forecasting the dynamics of opinions in Russian society, taking into account the influence of digital media and deterioration of the economic situation in the country. The chosen modeling method helps to predict the dynamics of population, economy and political system, taking into account their mutual influence. Each agent is assigned an appropriate set of norms and values and a model is designed showing how they change under the influence of the agent's standard of living, communication with acquaintances and impact of the media. The model we present differs from its known analogues due to its connection with the model of artificial society, reflecting the population and economy of Russia on the basis of current data. The behavior of agents in the model is based on the concept of a social agent, which includes the principles of dividing agents into clusters of social activity, a way to represent the norms and values of the agent in the form of a set of options with varying frequency and the function of constructing subjective assessments of the standard of living based on the comparison of the agent with its environment. Information content of the model is based on the analysis of the results of the seventh wave of the World Values Survey concerning the relationship between the income level, assessment of the work of the political system and the norms of social responsibility, which showed a significant degree of correlation between incomes, political assessments and the norms of residents. On the basis of the developed model, we carried out scenario calculations so as to build a forecast of the likely dynamics of public sentiment in various economic conditions. The results obtained indicate a rather significant relationship between the economic situation and the satisfaction of residents with the actions of the government. In the developed model, the change in a person's beliefs is limited to their inner world; therefore, implementing new aspirations in attempts to change one's own life or society is an important direction for future research.

AB Border regions are significant geostrategic territories, which long-term sustainable development is one of the priorities of Russia's national security. The specificity of their economic-geographical position necessitates the development and implementation by the authorities of special governance approaches aimed at finding a balance between the openness and barrier function of the state border. One of the most common tools for the spatial development of border areas is the sustainable cross-border cooperation with the regions of neighboring countries using various froms of cross-border cooperation, incl. focused on the generation and diffusion of innovations. The covid-19 coronavirus pandemic, having become a truly global challenge of our time, has made significant changes not only in the policies of many countries regarding the border, but also in the functioning of already established cross-border regions. The impossibility of fully implementing the previous formats of interethnic and interregional interaction has necessitated the search for new forms of cooperation, primarily based on the use of rapidly developing digital technologies. This led to the growth of academic and practical interest in substantiating the mutual effects of digitalization, innovation and internationalization for the regions. This article is devoted to assessing the potential and prospects of cross-border digitalization of the Western borderland of Russia. The objectives of the study were to identify the gap between border regions in the level of accessibility and penetration of digital technologies, as a significant condition for the formation of cross-border digital connections. The object of study is 15 subjects of the Russian Federation and 17 regions of NUTS 2 neighboring states. Using geoinformation and statistical methods of analysis, a typology of regions by the value of the digitalization index is proposed, with the allocation of leaders, moderate and lagging regions, and an assessment of their spatial location relative to the state border. Possible reasons for the current digital inequality, primarily of a socio-economic nature, are discussed. The determining role of the institutional factor in realizing the potential of cross-border digitalization has been substantiated. It is concluded that political efforts for digital convergence in the western direction are being undertaken only between Russia and Belarus, although further intensification is required.

AB The subject of the study is historical method of interpretation in law, its capacities and types. Despite the recognition of historical interpretation by legal science, there are no specialized works and there is no consensus on the content of this method of interpretation. Historical interpretation is considered both as an interpretation based on a previous rule of law, as an interpretation considering the conditions for the adoption of the norm, and as an interpretation based on the practice of applying the interpreted norm.
   The purpose of the study is to substantiate the authors' hypothesis that historical interpretation in law is an intellectual activity that involves clarifying the content of a legal prescription, achieved based on identifying legal and non-legal factors that both precede the creation of the norm and accompany its adoption. In addition, the authors set the task to identify those factors that should be taken into account in historical interpretation, as well as to classify the types of historical interpretation.
   The analysis of historical interpretation is made using scientific methods: induction and deduction, formal legal, comparative legal synchronous and diachronic methods.
   The main results, scope of application. Historical interpretation considers political, economic, social, and legal factors. Legal factors include the rules of law that preceded the interpreted norm, repealed acts, official and unofficial documents of law- making entities, draft laws, acts and the norms contained therein that accompanied the interpreted regulation, i.e. were adopted simultaneously with the interpreted norm, as well as other factors, such as the level of development of legal science and legal technique.
   The authors suppose that historical interpretation cannot be considered as a homogeneous way of interpretation. In reality, the historical interpretation in law can be carried out using different techniques and methods, in relation to heterogeneous legal prescriptions, and carried out by subjects with different legal status. Therefore, several grounds for classifying historical interpretation are proposed. First, it is a classification that considers the connection of historical interpretation with the other ways of interpretation. According to this criterion, it is possible to divide it into a proper historical and a complex historical interpretation. Complex historical interpretation includes historical-systematic, historical-functional, historical-teleological, historical-legal, and historical-linguistic interpretation. Second, the basis may be the sources of law that contain the rules of law. On this basis, historical interpretation is divided into the interpretation of prescriptions of normative legal acts, legal customs, normative contracts, etc. Third, it is possible to classify the historical interpretation, depending on whether the rule of law is valid or not, into the historical interpretation of the rules that have lost their legal force and the historical interpretation of the rules of the current law. The latter, in its turn, is divided into the interpretation of the current legal norms of the current content and those legal norms that have not lost their force but are outdated in content. The fourth classification is based on subjects and includes historical official interpretation and historical unofficial interpretation.
   Conclusions. Correct approach to the concept and process of historical interpretation of the content of legal norms, as well as the choice of the type of historical interpretation helps in law enforcement, allows you to put forward scientific hypotheses, predict the further development of law based on historical knowledge of the interpreted norm, assess the possibility of reviving canceled acts in recurring socio-economic and political-legal situations.

DE postmetaphysics; antimetaphysics; metaphysics; phenomenology; Husserl
AB The article aims to establish the relationship of Husserl's phenomenology to three philosophizing strategies: metaphysics, antimetaphysics and postmetaphysics. The article is divided into three thematic blocks. In the first, the authors analyze the concept of metaphysics in opposition to antimetaphysics. The consideration of metaphysics takes place by referring to Aristotle's Metaphysics, in which the metaphysical way of philosophizing is concentrated and designated. Auguste Comte's positivism was chosen to consider antimetaphysics. The result of this analysis is the definition of metaphysics as a philosophical discipline engaged in the search for intelligible principles of the world. Antimetaphysics, on the contrary, does not have a clear definition, but its essence is expressed in the rejection of the metaphysical way of philosophizing. The speculative way of philosophizing is recognized as erroneous by antimetaphysics. In the second block, the authors analyze postmetaphysics based on the program essays of Jurgen Habermas, who is the author of this concept. Habermas identifies four metaphysical (identity thinking, idealism, philosophy of consciousness, a strong concept of theory) and postmetaphysical (procedural rationality, situational reason, the linguistic turn, deflating the extra-ordinary) characteristics that are in opposition to each other. The authors highlight the problem of the lack of postmetaphysical consensus and give a general description of postmetaphysics contrasting it with both metaphysics and antimetaphysics. In the third block, the authors reveal the relationship of Husserl's phenomenology to the previously established strategies of philosophical thinking. The authors begin by allocating Husserl's own opinion about metaphysics. This allocation turns out to be difficult, due to Husserl's rare use of this term. However, in Cartesian Meditations Husserl directly declares the metaphysical nature of phenomenology as the First Philosophy which is a reference to Aristotle. Through an appeal to Husserl's legacy, the authors prove Husserl's non-antimetaphysicity. Finally, the authors match Husserl's phenomenology with four postmetaphysical characteristics. The overall result of the research is the indication of phenomenology as a metaphysical project that includes elements of postmetaphysics.

LA English
DT Article
DE Poland; Lithuania; International Relations; ethnic minorities
AB This article tracks how relations between two neighbouring states of the Baltic region, Poland and Lithuania, developed over the last decades. These relations cannot be described in unambiguous terms. On the one hand, common aspirations for European integration created conditions for rapprochement and cooperation. On the other, the partnership has been complicated by disagreements and mutual claims. The main problem is the situation of the correspondent ethnic minorities in the two countries: Poles in Lithuania and Lithuanians in Poland. According to the Polish authorities, the interests of Lithuania's Polish residents are not safeguarded, and their rights are infringed. Similar complaints are voiced by Vilnius regarding the situation of ethnic Lithuanians in Poland. These contradictions are partly smoothed by common political interests: cooperation within the North Atlantic Alliance, defiance of the notorious 'threat from the East' and joint support for the pro- Western opposition in the neighbouring Belarus.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE power; domination; politics of emancipation; empowerment; conceptions of
   domination
AB This article examines the tensions between political power and domination in contemporary democratic societies. In doing so, it explores the ways to study power relations in the framework of modern conceptions of domination. Their analytically promising development was stimulated by the widespread and large-scale intensification of social relations of domination. Domination is defined as a form of structural and dispositional power that deprives the representative institutions of their democratic content and enhances non-political power interaction. The modern theory of domination claims emancipation and empowerment to be the highest political values and raison d'etre of democracy. Power and politics are evaluated on a scale which has for poles "non-political power/domination" and "political power/empowerment". The paper presents the most influential modern concepts of domination and reviews the major divisions in discussions of power and democratic politics in the scientific discourse of domination. The working hypothesis of the theory of domination was verified using the data of all-Russian representative surveys (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021) conducted by the Comparative Political Research Department of the Institute of Sociology of the Federal Center of Theoretical and Applied Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The article explores data analysis that was done in line with the approach of the Neo-republican conception of domination as arbitrary power, which is widely recognized as the most influential in the contemporary discourse of domination. The finding that there is a deep penetration of relations of domination in Russian society is reached by estimating their impact in several dimensions: processes of alienation and social disintegration, interiorization of political culture of servitude, promotion of strategies of "exit".

TI Ukrainian crisis in Japan's domestic political discourse
SO JAPANESE STUDIES IN RUSSIA

DT Article
DE Russia-Japan relations; Ukrainian crisis; foreign policy making process;
   Japan's foreign policy
AB The Ukrainian crisis, which came into its active phase in February 2022, led to the collapse of Russia's relations with many countries, and Japan was no exception. The Japanese government expressed strong criticism of Russia's actions and joined the anti-Russian sanctions with, probably, most vigor, compared to any other Asian nation. This makes the question about the reasons for such course pursued by Tokyo vis-a-vis Russia a particularly timely one. In Russia, there is a widespread opinion that such position held by Tokyo is caused mostly by pressure from the United States. Yet such view seems to be a gross simplification. This article attempts to analyze the positions of various participants of the Japanese foreign policy making process about the events unfolding in Ukraine. It shows that, even though all key parties, irrespective of their political orientation, take a critical stance towards the actions of the Russian Federation, their statements show some nuances reflecting their ideological priorities. For example, the ruling LDP emphasizes solidarity with the US; its junior coalition partner, Komeito, stresses humanitarian aspects and the role of the UN; the Japan Innovation Party criticizes the government for indecisiveness and calls for more active military policy, while the left-wing populist Reiwa Shinsengumi even refused to support the relevant Diet resolution to demonstrate its principled stance to the voters. There are indeed opinions which can arguably be called apologetic towards Russia. However, those holding such opinions are but a minority and are hardly able to alter the position of the government or the Japanese public as a whole. There is a virtual consensus about the issue, and nuances in the positions of major political forces are inconsequential. One would be justified to assume that, under any probable domestic political situation, Tokyo will not change its policy about the matter.

AB Problematics of the Tambov village development after suppression of the Antonov's mutiny remains little studied. Socio-economic, ideological, cultural, and educational struggle against the consequences of the Tambov economic and political conflict was an important aspect in state policy, the same as use of military and political measures in the "re-socialization" of anti-Soviet villages. To stabilize the situation on the ground, lengthy progressive steps were required on the part of authorities. The author attempts to study the period of "post-Antonovschina" as a separate period in the Tambov village development. Significance of the work is determined by the need to analyze the consequences of peasant uprising in order to develop means of resolving deep socio-political crisis. Systematic interdisciplinary approach has made it possible to analyze content and features of the Tambov village development in the "post-Antonovschina" period. It also provides an opportunity to apply interdisciplinary tools of historical, socio-humanitarian, and economic sciences, thus significantly expanding research potential and providing deeper conclusions. In preparation of the article, general scientific and special historical research methods have been used. A special place in is occupied by the theory of modernization. Mobilization of historical sources on this topic has been carried out for the first time. The article presents the historiography of the problem and characterization of documentary sources from regional archives of Tambov and Voronezh (State Archive of the Tambov Region, State Archive of the Socio-Political History of the Tambov Region, State Archive of the Socio-Political History of the Voronezh Region) that contain wide and comprehensive array of materials, some of which have not been introduced into scientific use or published. Documentary materials from regional archives permit to piece together complete picture of the events in the Tambov gubernia in the first years following the Antonov's mutiny. They also permit to draw conceptual conclusions on the historical fate of peasant generation that saw the Antonov's mutiny, to identify the reasons for restoration of "moral economy" in the Tambov gubernia in 1920-21, to determine features of peasant identity transformations under the influence of civilizational challenge, to explore the Bolsheviks' "appeasement" of peasantry in the zone of the Tambov uprising.

AB The paper examines public discussions on the political economy of socialism and the socialist project in general, which began after the death of I. Stalin and continued until 1973. The pragmatic and romantic lines of understanding socialism and attitudes towards communism are highlighted. The position of the "pragmatists" is presented in the first textbook of political economy published in 1954. Eventually it retained the possibility of transforming Soviet socialism into a market economy. Actually, this possibility was implemented in China in the late 1970s. However, in the USSR, it provoked dead resistance. At the level of the party system and related political economists, the goal was to interpret economic phenomena within the orthodox version of Marxism. On the contrary, the "romantics" such as E. Ilyenkov defended the most radical project of building a future communist society, which would make it possible to overcome the division of labor and the related alienation still seen under the actual socialism. It is a historical paradox that romantic projects imposed the evolution of the USSR along the "Chinese path".

AB The problem of identifying the dynamics of changes in the human potential of the Eurasian Economic Union is in the focus of attention of the EAEU member states; each of them takes its own measures against economic and political risks and threats on the way toward ensuring national demographic security. Russia has formulated and operates its own systems for assessing and monitoring demographic security. However, due to the complex nature of the problem of ensuring the demographic security of the EAEU countries, it must be considered and solved through the implementation of state programs not only within the country, but also within the framework of the Eurasian Economic Union as a whole. Our aim is to identify negative trends in demographic development in all post-Soviet countries during the collapse of the USSR, which led to a decrease in human potential in Russia and other EAEU countries, and to substantiate the system of indicators and indices of demographic security in the context of Eurasian integration. We consider the resource opportunities that the EAEU countries obtain due to the functioning of a single integration association, and provide the overview of trends, problems and contradictions of integration processes. Based on the comparative analysis of the demographic situation in the EAEU member states, we can talk about the general indicators of crisis changes: a decrease in the birth rate, an increase in mortality, increased mobility of the population, although each country in these years was characterized by its own special dominants reflecting the demographic situation. Our systematic measurements of the dynamics of changes in Russia's human potential in the context of integration processes, based on the idea of an empirical model of integration, planning and forecasting within the framework of the Eurasian Economic Union, allowed us to identify quantitative and qualitative signs of the functioning of the demographic development of the EAEU countries and develop a number of significant recommendations. The results of the study can be used in the development of the state policy of Russia and the EAEU countries in the field of ensuring the stability of demographic security in the conditions of integration.

   Autonomy Movement; Komi Voityr; triadic configuration

AB This article proposes a framework for classifying ethnic minority organisations based on a broad combination of discursive and non-discursive criteria rooted in their political opportunities profile. One diasporic and one non-diasporic organisation were chosen for Russia and Poland, respectively. Diasporicity is understood according to William Safran's criteria and Rogers Brubaker's triadic configuration. The Russian study cases are Komi Voityr and the Russian Polish Congress; the Polish, the Silesian Autonomy Movement and the Belarussian House. The analysis of their status, activities, domestic and external political impact, localisation and role in the 'triadic configuration' has shown that the four cases are ethnic minority associations, and their legal status and scope of activities differ significantly. Their domestic political opportunities are rather scarce. Out of the four cases, just one organisation is an active part in Brubaker's classical triadic configuration; its role is not traditional, ascribed to the respective 'angle'. Although both Russian associations enjoy an official status, their activities are limited to the cultural, memorial and linguistic domains, primarily at the national level. In Poland, both associations act internationally as advocacy groups, and their activities are not confined to culture and language. Far from being universally applicable, the proposed classification framework can still add to the comparative ethnic politics toolkit.

AB Introduction. The historical literature noted the active participation of the Novgorod nobility in the events of the Time of Troubles. The question of the fate of the Novgorod nobility during the reign of Mikhail Fedorovich has been much less studied. This article is devoted to the consideration of the question of the entry of representatives of the Novgorod nobility into the Sovereign's court of Tsar Mikhail Methods and materials. The article is based on the use and comprehensive analysis of the sources, which show the process of entry of the Novgorod nobility into the Sovereign's court. The article uses documentary sources, including new archival materials. The author of the article uses the methods of prosopographic and historical-genealogical research. Analysis. The author of the article showed a very wide scale of the entry of the Novgorod nobles into the various ranks of the sovereign's court. As a rule, those persons who deserted from Novgorod to the side of Moscow and faithfully served the Moscow authorities were granted to the court of Tsar Mikhail By granting these nobles to serve at the court, the government of Tsar Mikhail had the goal of strengthening its political support. Results. The author comes to the conclusion that the enrollment of a number of representatives of the Novgorod nobility in the sovereign's court led not to the strengthening, but to the weakening of the Novgorod service corporation as a whole, since it removed the most prominent and active nobles from its composition. Once in the sovereign's court, people from Novgorod families gradually lost ties with the Novgorod nobility and sought to establish themselves in the new court environment.

AB The pandemic of the COVID-19 coronavirus infection has formed a special biopolitical modality of life, that of vita COVIDa. Biopolitics, the tools of which the authorities turned to in a pandemic, re-assembled the social space, thus changing the flow of social time. In this accelerated mode, the path from isolation through quarantine to vaccination has been completed. Historically-proven tools to combat the pandemic have been consistently combined. What was new was the appeal to the arsenal of modern digital technologies which made it possible to create a unique flexible barrier environment and control the process of the immunization of the population. Vita COVIDa was a form of further restriction of active life (vita activa). During the pandemic, consumption increased as an aspect of the work managed by animal laborans; there is a lack of creative activity carried out by homo faber; and there is a collapse of public space, leading to a pseudo-political virtual polemic in which a person gets bogged down as a zoon politikon. In conditions when the contemplative life (vita contemplativa) is captured by the effect of stickiness in the interpassivity mode, vita COVIDa slides to routine work and hyper-consumption, increasingly assigning the priority role of animal laborans to a person. The special spaces of the stationary ("Red Zone" or"camp of life") and mobile (QR code) camps, formed in the mode of an undeclared state of emergency, produce a "naked life" (vita nuda). The increasing tension creates prerequisites for the invasion of the friend/enemy political-identifier proper into social relations, situationally assigning the status of homo sacer to persons whose modus operandi is perceived as risky. Foucault understood racism is actualized in the biopolitical space of the pandemic. The contradictory trends of the pandemic should be considered within the framework of the Esposito immunization paradigm, in which the pandemic with its threats of social collapse should be considered as something that requires an immune response in the form of a coordinated response of the authorities and the population to the threats of social collapse. The intense confrontations between humanity and disease and between the authorities and the population in the field of imposed restrictions and responsible adoption of the proposed measures lead to the need to develop co-vida vita (co-life) as a way of living and overcoming vita COVIDa during the return to the "old" new normality.

TI ALTERNATIVE FOR GERMANY: BETWEEN CONSERVATISM AND RIGHT-WING POPULISM

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Alternative for Germany; right-wing populism; nationalism; conservatism;
   euroscepticism
AB The rise of the right-wing populism has become a distinguishing feature of the political life of European countries at the beginning of the 21st century. Over the last 20-25 years, right-wing populist parties have turned from once marginal associations into an important component of the party-political system of the EU countries. The key components of the ideology of the parties of this type include ethno-cultural nationalism, anti-immigrant attitudes, anti-globalism, and euroscepticism. Similarly to other populists, their representatives claim to express the interests of the "true" people, which they understand as an organic unity that is opposed to the self-serving and morally degraded establishment.
   The German version of right-wing populism manifests itself in the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which stands somewhat apart from the European right-wing populist organizations and differs from most of them in its genesis. The AfD was founded in 2013 by the conservatives and national liberals and in the first few years of its existence it used to be in fact a national conservative eurosceptic party. Although later its right-wing component became stronger, the party still decisively dissociates itself from right-wing radicalism and denies any connection with the German right-wing tradition. The preservation of the national and cultural identity of Germany, the restriction of the influx of immigrants, the rejection of the euro and the transformation of the European Union into an association of sovereign states are among the most important AfD's principles set out in the party platform.
   The electoral base of the AfD consists of those Germans who lose out from globalization, do not accept multiculturalism and are concerned about the influx of migrants from other cultures into Germany. The party is most popular in the eastern lands of Germany. In addition to the extreme right movement, which gravitates towards right-wing radicalism, the party also retains a moderate conservative one. Nevertheless, the AfD remains a party that no one wants to "shake hands" with and has almost no chance of entering power.

ID PROPAGANDA MODEL; PART
AB The article focuses on the political cartoons about Russia and analyzes the potential of multimodal media texts as the tools of popular geopolitics. The author also employs S. Hall's concept of propaganda, considering the text of a caricature from semiotic perspective. The integration of the theoretical fields of popular geopolitics and propaganda is substantiated, since political cartoons not only form stereotypes about politics and international relations among media readers, but also perform propaganda functions, broadcasting the point of view of the information platform on Russian politics and Russia. The empirical base of the study embraces 242 political cartoons from Russian-language and English-language foreign media, posted in the public domain on the Internet in 2020-2021, the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Political cartoons are analyzed with the method of expert evaluation and interdisciplinary classifier for the analysis of political cartoons. The obtained empirical results were subjected to statistical processing, including the identification of correlations. The results demonstrate that in foreign media political cartoons about Russia and Russian politics create two different images of Russia. The first description is typical for English cartoons where Russia appears in the context of international relations, mostly its ties with the United States; and the target character in English cartoon is the Russian president. English-language cartoons are more often focused on harsh criticism and the use of schematized images. Moderate criticism dominates in Russian-language cartoons of foreign media; the target characters are not only the president, but also other representatives of Russian society. Thematically, Russian-language cartoons are constructed in the context of Russia's internal political problems; the field of education is usually the most intentionally "negative". According to the study, it is the Russian-language cartoons of foreign media that have the most complex and rich visual code and use Aesopian language. In conclusion, the author highlights the importance of further studies of the tools of popular geopolitics, as well as the need to improve the practice of creating multimodal media texts in the logic of the Russian understanding of geopolitics.

DT Article
DE collective memory; political repressions; monument; counter-monument;
   memory sites; politics of memory; chronotope; Perm-36
AB The authors propose a typology of sites of memory of political repressions that took place in different periods of Russian history, which emerged under the influence of a set of historical, social and cultural factors. The purpose of the study is to trace the logic of the formation of specific types of monuments, including those existing in the form of the so-called counter-monuments, in the process of implementing the politics of memory and formulating ideas about the traumatic past. The authors used the chronotopic method of examining sites of memory in a number of regions of Russia, such as the memorial complex Perm-36, multiple sites of commemoration at the Bolshoy Solovetsky Island, places of memory at the Rybinsk water reservoir, the Butovo polygon, memorial objects in the Saratov region, and the Republic of Mordovia, architectural constructions in the Russian Far East, etc. Theoretically, the research is rooted in the concept of "memory sites" proposed by Pierre Nora and understood as a combination of material and spiritual elements of culture that carry a symbolic load associated with understanding the social past. The authors demonstrate the presence of several types of memorial sites. It turned out that in the Russian domain of memory about the political repressions there are no sites that meet the criteria of a traditional monument. Conditionally traditional monuments can be territorially localized (solitary or complex) or dispersed (standard or heterogeneous). The second type of monuments is defined as hybrid, including vernacular, alternative and palimpsest varieties. Vernacular monuments are determined by their agents of construction, while the alternative ones are associated with specific interpretations of the past and can be supplemented with new constructive elements in the course of existence, palimpsests imply the explicit or hidden presence of many symbolically loaded layers. Counter-monuments constitute a special type represented by walking, landscape, ecological, and disappearing monuments. They are characterized as performative and participatory. The presence of different types of monuments proves not so much the absence of a unified strategy of commemoration in Russian society, but rather the fact that multiple social groups participate in the process of commemoration, producing heterogeneous and polyphonic monuments.

AB The development of science in the Soviet autonomous republics was the result of a consistent policy of the government, especially when the institutions have opened up. The Institute of History, Language and Literature (IHLL) occupies a worthy place among the scientific collectives of UFRC of RAS. It is one of the oldest research institutions of Bashkortostan (BASSR). Human factor, a specific personality, has always been playing an important role in the history of many crucial events of research institutions of the 20th century. IHLL started its activity by solving urgent issues of Bashkir writing, national literature, the accumulation of folklore, archaeological and ethnographic material, etc. Therefore, a lot depended on the personality of the leader. Being opened as The Society for the Study of Everyday life, Culture and History of Bashkiria with Nuriagzam Tagirov at its head in 1922, it was renamed The Bashkir Research Institute of National Culture, where Mikhail Arefyevich Solyanov became the first director. The development of Russian historical personalism in the twen-tieth century allowed us to restore many biographies of the Institute employees, also of the eminent personalities of our republic and Russia. It is significant that on this particular 100th anniversary of the institution these methods and methodology made possible to clarify many aspects of our first director workdays, to link the IHLL through his personality with such renowned organizations as The Russian State Library named after V. I. Lenin and MSLI. The role of M. A. Solyanov was bright but short-lived. After all historical personalism has its scientific and practical significance. The work will find its reader among historians, philosophers, teachers of the humanities.

DT Article
DE BRICS; Russia; Brazil; Global South; Relationship
AB Since 2006, when the foreign ministers of Brazil and Russia indicated their desire to turn BRICS what was previously only an acronym developed in 2001 by Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs into a political organization a lot has changed in terms of policy making, geopolitics, and international relations. Since the formation of BRICS 16 years ago, the basis for collaboration has been strengthened and the fields of cooperation have been broadened. It has evolved into an all-encompassing and multi-level framework, with the BRICS Summit leading the way, supported by BRICS Meetings of Foreign Ministers and Meetings of National Security Advisers, carrying out practical cooperation in dozens of areas such as economy and trade, finance, science and technology, industry, agriculture, culture, education, health, think tanks. Both Brazil and Russia are significant regional leaders and are leading members of important international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and the Group of 20 (G20), which places both at the center of the international arena. Although, Brazilian-Russian relations are not new; their participation in a South- South only forum such as BRICS might be noteworthy. That being said, and in order to better understand how both countries are interconnected, this paper proposes an analysis of Brazilian-Russian relations within the BRICS framework, with the goal to assess key aspects of their cooperation within it, and to argue that these relations within the framework of multilateral cooperation formats could bring both countries even closer, thus strengthening the Global South even further. The author highlights that the BRICS grouping can be viewed in two ways: a) as a new force seeking to overthrow the existing international system to create an alternative world order, to challenge the established Western powers, and to replace key financial institutions with new ones; and b) as a group of large emerging economies seeking to expand their currently limited ability to compete globally, concluding that the combined efforts of Brazil and Russia have provided some of the impetus needed to achieve this goal.

AB This article analyzes the outlooks and attitudes of youth in the so-called Finno-Ugric republics of Russia. It is based on a set of surveys we carried out in these republics in 2017-20 as well as on official statistical data and other sources. Our analysis demonstrates that the multifaceted crisis in these regions seriously impacts the attitudes and outlooks of youth, causing a rise in oppositional attitudes, a loss of trust in regional political institutions, and other negative consequences. On the other hand, ethnic traditions and ethnic identity do not represent a particular topic of concern for these young people. Therefore the majority of them are uninterested in ethnic organizations.

AB The article analyzes various aspects of the interpretation of the concepts of personification of thestate in modern political philosophy and political science. In particular, it is emphasized that, inpurely theoretical terms, the paradoxes associated with numerous theoretical attempts to identify a"political personality" with the state go back to the philosophy of the early modernity. In theiroriginal form, they were very clearly presented by Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan and his otherpolitical writings. The immediate source of much of the theoretical debates in modern scientific andphilosophical literature are the Hobbesian definitions of the personality and the state in chapters 16and 17 of Leviathan. The authors examine in detail the complex process of analytics of theHobbesian legacy in the works of M. Oakeshott, Q. Skinner, D. Runciman, F. Pettit, A. Abizadeh,D. Gauthier, B. Holland, S. Fleming and other scientists and political theorists, focusing especiallyon the continuity between Hobbesian political philosophy and ancient tradition (Plato, Aristotle,Thucydides, Roman Stoics). A number of complex issues related to the interpretation of thepersonification of the state in modern political philosophy and international political theory arestudied in detail. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of theoretical discussions betweensupporters of political realism and constructivism (N. G. Onuf A. Wendt, F. Kratochwil, R. Schuett,R. Pettman, R. Oprisko, K. Kaliher, etc.)

AB This article examines the itineraries of Margaret of Valois (1553-1615), Queen of Navarre, during her stay in the south of France between the late 1570s and early 1580s, which coincided with the crucial phase of the Religious Wars between Catholics and Huguenots. The main source for the study of these itineraries are the letters of Queen Margaret from the National Library of Russia, which make part of the collection of Peter Dubrovsky. The article traces the history of letters of the Queen of Navarre in St Petersburg, and it is suggested that the carton of the documents (Autograph 57) is part of the personal archive of State Secretary Villeroy. The author also analyses new data on the princess' itineraries during her childhood, based on the new electronic database, as well as the historiography of the question of her movement, which makes it possible to understand the place of the St Petersburg autographs in the reconstruction of Margaret's unknown itineraries in 1579-1582.
   Most of Margaret's letters were written in territories ruled by Henry of Navarre, in Guyenne and Gascony and Navarre and represent an array of 32 documents of great importance, which help determine exactly where the Queen went to, indicate the trajectory of her movement, specify the duration of her stays in particular localities, and respectively, suggest possible delivery times for letters to recipients, mainly to her brother Henry III and her mother, Catherine de' Medici. The study of Margaret's messages from the point of view of her itineraries also helps place them in the historical context of religious and political events of the Civil Wars period in France, identify the details of the peacemaking role of the Queen in the south of the country, as well as understand the mechanisms for the implementation of peace treaties and decisions by the opposing parties.

AB The emergence and development of digital civic participation is an inevitable consequence of Internet penetration into various spheres of life. Despite the novelty of the phenomenon itself, the practices of online activism have become engrained in public life; and they have a significant impact on certain events, and sometimes even act as the main trigger of subsequent changes, which is especially typical of the political system. At the same time, there are many concerns related to the spread of digital civics, so that it is very difficult to talk about the long-term implications of such transformations. In this regard, the purpose of our research is to summarize the experience of studying digital civic participation and highlight the features of its manifestation in a modern world. The research methodology is based on the principles of making a systematic scientific review. During the analysis, we identify essential foundations and distinctive features of online activism compared to the traditional offline format, which are reflected in the forms of manifestation, methods of attracting and composition of the participants themselves, as well as the conditions necessary for collective action. The scope of digital civic participation is largely ensured by the ease of entry into public affairs, and the variability of activities and types of networking. Despite the prevalence of the thesis about the purely external visibility of online activism and its destructive consequences, specific empirical studies do not confirm this conclusion. Nevertheless, the threats of the spread of ICT are quite real and go far beyond the virtual space. In conclusion, we formulate several polemic provisions on possible ways to overcome the contradictions in this area. Our research contributes to the development of scientific ideas about the specifics of digital civic participation and the disclosure of the potential of its application from the standpoint of modern challenges and threats.

DT Article
DE USSR; Austria; Germany; N. S. Khrushchev; J. Raab; K. Adenauer;
   compensation supplies; bilateral trade
AB The author of this article carries out a comparative analysis of the trade and economic relations of the Soviet Union with Austria and the FRG from 1955 to 1964 (focusing on features of formation and development, contractual foundations, driving forces, and problems). At the same time, the emphasis of the research is on identifying the influence of the political factor of interstate relations on the development of economic cooperation. A comparative analysis of the history of the USSR's trade and economic relations with Austria and Germany has not been carried out before. The history of the economic interaction of the Soviet Union with these contractors separately has not been sufficiently studied by historical science either. Regarding Austria, Russian and foreign historiography has traditionally focused on the State Treaty of 1955 and its economic component in the form of compensatory supplies. As for the FRG, this initial period has not been studied at all in national historical science, except for several essays. German historians have studied not so much the government's economic course as the initiatives and activities of industry representatives united in the eastern committee of the German economy. The author employs the comparative-historical method of research and methods of economic science (to a limited extent) and statistical analysis (indicators of foreign trade, bilateral trade). The article aims to contribute to a more complete reconstruction of the wide range of East-West interactions during the Cold War by exploring such a convergent component for both systems as bilateral trade. The Austrian phenomenon of the successful development of trade relations with the USSR is viewed through the prism of a compromise solution to the Austrian question and its economic consequences in the form of fulfilment and reduction of compensatory deliveries. The author highlights the role of the political factor in foreign economic planning and its implementation by both the Soviet Union and its Western capitalist counterparts, neutral Austria, and Germany, which is part of NATO, determining the differences between the latter. If for the trade and economic relations between the USSR and Austria the political factor played a constructive role which brought the two countries closer, for relations with the FRG it was quite destructive, mostly because of the fault of the West German leadership. The article refers to documents of the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History and the Russian State Archive of Economics introduced into scholarly circulation for the first time and egodocuments.

DE Melanchthon; Aristotle; methodology; Wittemberg; Reformation
AB In the beginning of the Reformation, Martin Luther opposed not only medieval scholasticism, but also Aristotelian philosophy as its foundation. Philip Melanchthon, his younger humanistically predisposed colleague at the Wittenberg University, at first appropriated such Luther's stance by offering a course grounded on Pauline theological accents as interpreted by Augustine. Such a program, however, could not encompass the needs of the students of various fields of study. Therefore, in the1530s Melanchthon reorganized the University's curriculum by basing it on Aristotle's natural and moral philosophy. According to Melanchthon, who regularly taught philosophy of Aristotle and published commentaries on his works (On the Soul, The Nicomachean Ethics), appropriation of the general philosophical method had to precede any specialization within a course of studies. Melanchthon chose Aristotle's philosophy to that end as it satisfied the criteria of intellectual and linguistic accuracy and at the same time accessibility. He preferred it to the philosophical systems of Stoics, Platonists, and Augustine. Aristotle's works on natural philosophy are needed to develop an appropriate mindset to be able to strictly ground one's arguments on facts rather than resort to speculative syllogisms of scholastic kind. In other words, philosophy is necessary to cultivate a certain habit () as a practice of relating all cognizable things to the right method mastered by way of study of Aristotelian philosophy as it pertains to the chosen field. Aristotle's moral philosophy was supposed to be instrumental in maintaining the established order, to avoid turmoil and rebellion. Melanchton's pedagogical reform, which earned him the title of Praeceptor Germaniae, determined the character of higher education at the German universities at the time. Lessons of this reform with its foundational place for philosophy as such may turn out to be useful in deciding on priorities for contemporary higher education.

AB The article is devoted to the qualitative changes in Russian-Japanese relations that occurred after Abe's resignation from the post of Prime Minister in 2020 in connection with the transformation of the international political environment and domestic political developments in both countries. Among the international factors that contributed to the deterioration of bilateral relations, the author emphasizes the confrontation between the Kremlin and America after the change of administration in Washington in 2021, as well as the new aggravation of the situation around Ukraine in 2022. Allied with the United States, found itself in the opposing camp.
   The author focuses on the change in the Russian position on the problem of a peace treaty with Japan. The course was taken to demonstrate to Japan the futility of its position on the issue of border demarcation with Russia. There has also been a transformation of Japan's place and role in Russia's internal ideological and propaganda discourse, in which interest in the "crimes of Japanese militarism" in East Asian countries is becoming increasingly apparent. At the same time, the author considers the strengthening of critical attitude towards Japan not the result of a conscious ideological campaign directed specifically against Japan, but rather a reflection of the general atmosphere in the socio-political life of the country.
   The author believes that the acquisition in the face of Japan of a new "unfriendly" state on the Far Eastern borders will become a factor of military and political risk for Russia and will inevitably damage its security. Meanwhile, Russia should think about the fact that geostrategically it is important for it to have a strong partnership with Japan.

AB The paper studies report of the Omsk regional department of the OGPU to the local party leadership on anti-Soviet organizations and groups in the Omsk region in 1927, reflecting the efforts of Omsk security officers to combat anti-communist opposition, which in terms of the era was "anti-Soviet." Source analysis of the OGPU information statement shows its high reliability and informative value in relation to presence and nature of opposition in the Omsk region. Thus, diachronic research has become key method for analyzing data of the source. It has helped to analyze the state of opposition in the Omsk district in 1927 and to conclude that there was no real anti-communist opposition that could have been the basis for creation of counter-revolutionary organizations allegedly exposed by Omsk Chekists in the 1930s. Statistical method has made it possible to compare the Cheka data on the number of ex-White officers groups in the Omsk district with information on the number of lishenets officers (those deprived of voting rights) and thus to assess social and political activity of this category of Soviet citizens. Biographical method has permitted to study the document in connection with life and activities of the OGPU employee D.A. Bulatov who prepared it. The author comes to the conclusion that the document objectively testifies of absence of any significant organized anti-communist activity in Omsk in the first half of 1927. The focus of the work of the secret operational unit of the Omsk District Department of the OGPU in relation to anti-Soviet groups was surveyance of ex-White officers, mostly apolitical. This also confirms assessments of contemporary historians, courts, and prosecutors concerning fabricated cases of counter-revolutionary officer organizations in Omsk in the 1930s. The work may be of interest to researchers studying Russian society and activities of Soviet special services in the Stalin era.

AB The objective of the study is to determine one of the regulatory mechanisms of literary practices in the early 1930s USSR. The paper aims to analyze the methods of discussion; to identify the main requirements for literary texts; to review the changes made in reprints. In the course of the present research, we studied archival documents which had previously not been introduced into academic study (materials from two oral discussions of A. M. Dmitriev's novel "Aye to Steer the Ship" (1931), correspondence), as well as reviews published in periodicals. The novel was perceived as an achievement of the Literary Associ-ation of the Red Army and Navy, which "tutored" its author. The article pres-ents key points of the extensive discussion that reflected the ramifications of the RAPP's leaders' confrontation with the "Litfront" group. Political accusa-tions, rhetorical techniques based on logical fallacies, contradictory reproach-es all characterize the discourse of the era, while indicating that presumption of guilt was applied even to a writer loyal to the new regime. They also allow us to talk about the significant influence of critics and political workers on ed-itorial amendments made to the text. The article highlights recurrent demands placed on the text, which reflected the shift of early 1930s Soviet literature towards the sole Socialist Realism approach. It was assumed that the writer would plausibly depict the preferred constructed image of reality in accor-dance with the current policy of the party, offering the reader a role model-a Bolshevik hero. The same period saw the onset of the requirement to write in a simple literary language.

DE Fedor Dostoevsky; Yuly Aykhenvald; historiosophy; Russia; Europe;
   eurasian-ism; revolution
AB The paper discusses the perception of Fyodor Dostoevsky's work by Yuly Aykhenvald (1872-1928), a famous literary critic of the first quarter of the twentieth century. It shows that Aykhenvald's attitude toward Dostoevsky had undergone a certain evolution from a rejection via demands to "overcome" him to his recognition as one of the "spiritual leaders" of the thinking Russia alongside Pushkin and Leo Tolstoy. Yet Aykhenvald still had some controversy with Dostoevsky, above all over philosophy of history. The ques-tion of Russia's destiny and its relation to the West is addressed by Aykhenvald following the same algorithm that is used in the article by Thomas G. Masaryk (to which Aykhen-vald was reacting), namely through the prism of and in dispute with Dostoevsky. The pa-per proves that Aykhenvald focuses not on interpreting or analyzing Masaryk's ideas, but on refuting the views of the Eurasianists and that Eurasian ideas are the very philosophi-cal context that serves as a background for his argument with Dostoevsky. In refuting Dostoevsky's views on Europe and justifying his own historiosophic view of the entire world as a unified Europe, Aykhenvald eventually comes to the paradox that Dostoevsky, being the "denier of Europe", is the "intercultural cross-link" that ties Europe and Russia even more closely together. In this way, Dostoevsky's work turns out to be a starting point for Aykhenvald's own historiosophic framework, which brings him closer to both Russian interpreters of the Silver Age (Vikentii V. Veresaev) and the European philosoph-ical and political tradition (Thomas G. Masaryk).

DE Leviathan; Sovereign; Thomas Hobbes; idea of devil
AB There is a shift of research focus to theological problems in the works of Thomas Hobbes: eschatology, hell, the concept of the miracle, etc. Of particular interest is the figure of the devil. It occupied an important place in medieval consciousness and defined social life. The last third of the 17th century is marked by an active discussion among intellectuals about the status of the supernatural, especially the devil and his influence on social life. One of the initiators of this discussion was the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, the developer of the idea of the modern state. The devil is examined in terms of his role in Thomas Hobbes' political philosophy in Leviathan, or the Matter, Form, and Power of the Ecclesiastical and Civil State. First, Hobbes argues that the source of demonology was the worldview of the ancient Greeks, which influenced Jewish culture. Second, Hobbes' materialistic worldview rejects any argument about the immateriality of spirits and the devil. These definitions of the devil lead us to see the devil as a danger in terms of language: an ambiguous concept that can strip language of its performative properties, endanger the stability of the political order for fear of the devil but not of the Sovereign. Therefore, the Sovereign gets a monopoly on interpreting the devil through scripture. Third, the devil, according to Hobbes, does not designate a particular person, but only "an office, or quality". In other words, it is not a proper name, but an appellative. The devil as a proper name is a consequence of a mistranslation of the Bible. Fourth, Hobbes views the devil as the "earthly enemy of the church". This definition means that the figure is undergoing complete secularization and temporalization. It is now a nominal name used to refer to enemies of the state. If the kingdom of God is an extension of the earthly kingdom and all interpretations of sacred scripture are carried out by the state, the devil is any force that attacks the church and sacred scripture, challenging the state. As a result, Hobbes secularizes Early Modern period political discourse by trying to stop all the ambiguities of the Bible by securing the power of the Sovereign. The devil turns out to be a symbol of the expression of state disobedience and of the individual who has surrendered inalienable rights to a "man-made" god.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the most promising and popular strategies for the development of modern political science and the theory of international relations. In conditions of strategic instability, effective institutions of both national and global governance, designed to establish norms of collective action, are in demand. However, many of them, need to improve their efficiency. The author argues that the UN remains an key institution for international law, providing representativeness, regulation, and carrying out a political mission and a functional role. New structures are being created along with traditional international organizations, and rising powers are gaining influence. Contrary to popular belief, the rise of international institutions is not associated with a reduction in the role of the nation-state. The author believes that the idea that the threat is primarily posed by the so-called excessively 'rigid' states is flawed: at present, a kind of 'conceptual rehabilitation' of the effective states with a stable central government is overdue. In the context of global turbulence, the greatest danger is not 'tough', strong states, but 'weak' and 'fragile' - insolvent ones. The consideration of the regional dimension of modern political processes in the article reveals some evidence of the erosion of the vector of globalization during the massively increasing regionalization in its various manifestations, including macro-regionalization and glocalization. Within the study of methodological perspectives of regionalism, regional diversity and regional cooperation, both qualitative methods and quantitative strategies are used. Political governance and international relations, which represent a separate challenge and at the same time a new horizon of opportunities for political science, are the processes of comprehensive digitalization, including the use of big data (Big Data), artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies in political analytics. Big Data, artificial intelligence and other new technologies in political analytics is a new challenge and at the same time a popular prospect for political science and IR theories. This contributes to Russia's efforts to form a digital sovereignty-related agenda in this area. In order to stimulate interdisciplinary synthesis and empirical processing of large amounts of data on the subject areas of political science and international relations in Russia, it is necessary to form an integral scientific infrastructure, which MGIMO participates in developing with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia. Strengthening the value sovereignty of the Russian Federation in the face of external danger involves improving its axiological framework, within which it is difficult to overestimate the role of historical consciousness: it is historical experience that forms the coordinate system for assessing current events and justifying a reliable forecast of long-term development. The natural driver of this process is universities, which, in cooperation with local and regional communities, form vectors of socio-cultural activity and responsibility.

DT Article
DE second-order cybernetics; epistemology; knowledge; constructivism
AB The article discusses the emergence of second-order cybernetics based on work in experimental epistemology and the study of the nervous system, as well as the emergence of a new understanding of the cognitive process. Studies have shown that it is necessary to include a scientist-observer in the description of a system, since his or her specific characteristics and subjective world-view can influence the result of observation. The authors give examples of neurophysiological experiments that served as the basis for the conclusion that knowledge is a biological phenomenon, that each individual constructs his own "reality", which is consistent with the world of sensory experience, but is not identical to it. There are two ways of understanding cybernetics of higher orders. The first approach emphasizes that higher orders of cybernetics can be based on the introduction of additional dimensions (for example, second-order cybernetics relies on neurophysiology, third-order cybernetics takes into account data from sociology and political science, fourth-order cybernetics uses data related to the environment and social responsibility). The second approach is based on the opinion that there is no need for cybernetics of higher orders beyond second order cybernetics, since the observer himself can determine any system of interest to him (for example, a group within an organization, a society or the environment) and create any number of additional descriptions (H. von Forster). The authors of the article come to the conclusion that second-order cybernetics offers a higher conceptual level, drawing attention to the scientist (observer). Second order cybernetics leads to second order science. It points to a suitable epistemology for an information society. The inclusion of the scientist (observer) in observations changes the epistemological foundation of science.

AB The problem of stability and demographic success of a certain part of Russian rural settlements has been the focus of attention of the general public and representatives of various social sciences and humanities for many decades. Historical science finds its place in the study of the deep roots and causes of such stability and success. Even the major works of regional authors, as a rule, cover several decades of the initial history of the first settlements. Only in a few studies, the southern Russian fron -tier of the 18th - the first half of the 19th centuries is considered in a long historical retrospective. The aim of this research is to compare the paths to the current state of large settlements in the southernmost territories - the so-called second South Russian frontier. The current state of the studied large settlements in the South of European Russia shows that the decisive role in their stability was played by the initial favorable factors including comfortable natural conditions, support from the state, and the high level of socio-economic activity of people. The article provides additional concrete evidence of the positive result achieved by the state and the Russian population in the devel-opment of frontier territories through the skillful use of favorable conditions.The paper is intended for the specialists in history and social sciences, students and all those inter-ested in the fate of the South Russian frontier.

AB This article reviews Y.M. Plyusnin's monograph "The social structure of provincial society". The monograph is the result of more than 30 years of field research on provincial Russia. Plyusnin defines "provincial society" as the totality of "local communities" of small towns and adjacent villages, located between "the Russia of large and medium-sized cities" and "rural Russia". "Local communities" comprise smaller communes, i.e., mutual aid unions tied together by kinship and neighbor relations, spanning one or more villages, smaller towns, and their districts. The monograph analyzes the economic development of such communities, as well as their relationships with official state structures (seen through the prism of the theory of S.G. Kordonskiy). The work opens up new perspectives for understanding the social, political, economic, and cultural reality of Russia.

LA English
DT Article
DE normal science; post-normality; scientific ethos; history of science
AB The article questions the concept of post-normal science and emphasizes that despite the declarative detachment from social practice and freedom from politics, de facto science has always been social. On the one hand, the scientific community has always been aristocratic. The "classical ethos" of science presupposes openness and equality on conditions that require enormous efforts and self-sacrifice, this equality is beyond the norm, because a "normal" scientist is, as K. Popper noted, mediocrity. On the other hand, scientists at all times have taken an active social position, and the development of science has always been closely intertwined with social practices and the political process, as is well shown by T. Porter, L. Pinto, S. Shapin and S. Schaffer. From this point of view, science has always been post-normal - the "solutions" are always "urgent", and the corracy of the scientific ethos and the declarative isolation of the scientific community from policy and politics are of fundamental importance for the reproduction of science, which practically cannot, but is morally obliged to remain outside of them. To help practice, the scientist must be impractical; to create a norm, a scientist must be abnormal.

AB The aim of this work is to characterize the educational needs of Chinese students in Russian universities. A comprehensive sociological study was conducted to ensure the reliability of the results of scientific research. The analysis of the statistics on foreign students' total number in Russian higher education institutions for 2018-2020 shows that Russia is among the eight countries that are most attractive to foreign applicants and trainees of the states which import educational programs. At present, there are about 48,000 students from China in Russian universities, which is one of the largest shares of foreign students in Russian universities as a whole. The secondary analysis of sociological research materials covered more than 10 Russian and Chinese studies focused on motivation of Chinese students to choose a Russian higher educational institution and their adaptation to new social and cultural conditions. As a result, it was found that any research in this field is generally limited to one university or cluster of higher education institutions located in the same region or constituent entities of the Russian Federation. Moreover, the initial reasons why students decided to get higher education abroad, or specifically in Russia were not considered. The COVID-19 pandemic's effect on studying at Russian universities was not an issue in these works as well. In this regard, in 2020, the authors of this article conducted a series of indepth interviews and surveys of Chinese students studying at universities in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Rostov-on-Don, Nizhny Novgorod, Ufa, Ryazan, Perm, Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Tomsk, Bamaul, Irkutsk, Yakutsk, and Vladivostok. As a result of the consolidation of the data, the differences in the educational needs of students from China in Russian universities were analyzed depending upon geographical and social factors. The authors formulate proposals and recommendations for improving the organization of the educational process in the Russian higher education system. They also outline the advantages that a Russian university should have in order to attract foreign students from China. Empirical results can be applied to the development of management decisions in Russian higher education institutions regarding the recruitment of Chinese students, as well as the development of an international strategy of higher education institutions regarding student mobility from China.

DT Article
DE sustainable development; ecology; environmental consciousness;
   ecological crisis; national projects; social practices; ecological
   modernization
AB The article examines changes in environmental consciousness, which depend on how environmental threats are presented and perceived in public opinion and public discourse in Russia. Using the theory of socio-cultural risks and threats, we consider the formation of the so-called environmental paradigm, which interprets environmental consciousness as part of public consciousness. Analyzing the inclusion of the environmental agenda in the domestic public and political discourse, we show show that since the 1990s Russian legislation has been guided by international documents in this area, and the Russian Federation has actively participated in all significant international environmental forums. The attack on the non-profit sector initiated by the state authorities in the 2010s significantly reduced the number of non-governmental organizations in the environmental sphere and affected the content of public discourse. The low level of awareness of the progress and content of the national project "Ecology" indicates insufficient interaction of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation with civil society institutions and representatives of local environmental initiatives. As a result, poor involvement of the population in environmental processes can potentially lead to the emergence of occasional environmental protests. The data of sociological studies show that public awareness of environmental threats is growing rather slowly and unevenly. In the overall rating of threats, environmental threats usually rank 3rd-4th, but this has a small effect on environmental behavior and on the formation of nature-saving social practices. We consider promoting environmental consciousness as a process of helping people to become more aware of anthropogenic risks and strive for a healthy ecological environment. The typological group of "responsible" individuals identified on the basis of this approach differs from the group of "indifferent" ones according to a number of socio- demographic and sociopolitical features and demonstrates weak positive dynamics.

AB This publication is the first Russian translation of Max Weber's keynote address at the First Conference of the German Sociological Association (DGS) held at the Academy of Social and Commercial Sciences in Frankfurt, Germany, from October 19-22,1910. At the first session on the morning of October 20, he delivered the business report of the German Sociological Association that had been founded in Berlin the year before. Weber was given the floor as a chairman of the auditing board immediately after the opening speech The Pathways and Objectives of Sociology by the Association's president, Ferdinand TOnnies. In the conference transcript, Weber's presentation is referred to as the DGS"Business Report", though it is essentially the classic's attempt to delineate a framework research program for the then-institutionalizing German sociology. At the outset, Weber talks about the principles of the Association's activity as exemplified in its charter. First of all, he refers to the imperative of value neutrality, a central tenet to all Weberian sociology implying a purely scientific focus, i.e., free from political, ethical and other evaluations of scholarly interest in the subject. Additionally, he emphasizes the pragmatic nature of the DGS, since it is not a purely status-based association of academic"nobility". In the main part of the paper, Weber discusses the specific clusters of topics that the Association has chosen to study as its priorities, including the sociology of the media, the sociology of unions and public associations, and the sociology of key professions in modern society. The scholar concludes by speaking about the DGS financial situation, and its general dependence on promoting a culture of scholarly sponsorship patterned after the American model.

AB The purpose of this article is to reconstruct the roots, historical circumstances, and context of the transformation into a unique political symbol of one of the icons-the fresco of Saint Nicholas from the Moscow Kremlin Tower of St. Nicholas. The research is based on the materials of the media, diaries of contemporaries of the events, religious and historical-memorial literature of the 19th - early 20th centuries, as well as on the exhibits of state museums and private collections. The article describes the circumstances that influenced the manufacture of the icon presented to Admiral Alexander Kolchak by Bishop Boris Shipulin in Perm on February 19, 1919. The origin and symbolic meaning of the iconographic version of St. Nicholas of Mozhaisk are restored, and the changes in its status, associated with the memorialization of the events of the War of 1812, are traced. The history of the iconographic version of the Savior of Maloyaroslavets is analyzed, this being the first case when the damages from artillery and rifle fire were used as the most important part of the icon. nts at the Moscow Kremlin in late October - early November 1917 and the public reaction to them are further traced, in particular, the preparation and publication of a popular brochure by Bishop Nestor Anisimov. The creation of a revolutionary necropolis on Red Square, the move of the Lenin's government to Moscow, and the official demonstrations of May 1, 1918, transformed the symbolism of the Kremlin. The reaction to this was the "miracle on Red Square" - the release of the icon of St. Nicholas from the red banner covering it, and the public veneration of this icon. This event was reinforced in public opinion by the grandiose Orthodox religious processions led by Patriarch Tikhon on May 22, 1918. The conclusion is made that the conflict of the two sacred systems (traditional and revolutionary) made the Moscow Kremlin a space of special symbolic tension. The confrontation on Red Square between the demonstration on May 1 and the "miracle of the cloth" became a kind of "symbolic rehearsal" of the full-scale civil war. These events placed the icon of St. Nicholas in an exceptional position among other secular and ecclesiastical objects damaged during the October Revolution. The damage to this fresco was interpreted by the leaders of the Orthodox Church as a self-sufficient symbol of the whole damage caused by the revolution, and the release of the icon from the red cloth was interpreted as a prophesy of the fall of Bolshevik power. As a consequence, the idea of making a copy-icon depicting the marks of rifle fire was born.

DT Article
DE economic sanctions; political economy; Russia; economic interests;
   political interests; world politics
AB Aspects of the political economy of the policy of economic sanctions are addressed. Given the fact that decisions taken in both sender and target countries depend on the interaction of numerous groups of political and economic agents, sanctions research can be productive only if such behavior is explicitly modelled given the objective functions and institutional context they face. It is shown that the political economy approach can help resolve a number of paradoxes common in sanctions research, i.e., paradoxes related to the inefficiency of sanctions, a pro-conflict reaction to sanctions by target countries, escalation of inefficient sanctions by sender countries, and retaliatory measures. Analysis shows that escalation of economic sanctions against the Russian Federation cannot shift the country's foreign policy in the direction preferred by the sender countries. On the contrary, higher sanction costs for the Russian economy fuel domestic political support for current foreign policy decisions. Consequently, conflict resolution should rely upon multilateral political dialogue rather than economic sanctions.

DT Article
DE Italy; right-wing populism; discourse; Brothers of Italy; League;

AB The paper considers the transformation of the discourse of right- wing populist parties in Italy from 2018 to 2022. Based on the discourse analysis of the programs and electoral rhetoric of the " Brothers of Italy", " League" and "Forward Italy!", the author comes to the conclusion that Italian right-wing populism is becoming more moderate, replacing the concepts of " sovereignism" with "patriotism and conservatism" and rejecting euroscepticism. Nationalism is still characteristic of the right-wing parties in Italy, however, it is changing: the legalist approach towards migrants is gradually replacing the ethno-cultural and socio-economic approaches. Populism remains the basic strategy of right-wing parties, but the role of the main "enemy" of the Italian people is shifting from the European bureaucracy to the domestic mainstream center-left (i.e. Democratic Party). The authoritarianism of the right populists has seen the least change in terms of ideological content between 2018 and 2022, but its importance has increased with the growing public demand for political stability and the increasing personalization of politics. The research contributes to the study of the phenomenon of right-wing populism.

AB The article analyzes the official and political biographies of prominent dignitaries and military leaders of Poland, including K.F. Drutsky-Lyubetsky, S.F. Grabovsky, V.I. Krasinsky, S.A. Zamoysky, A.A. Rozhnetsky, and I.L. Turkul, who became members of the Imperial Council of State after the Polish Uprising of 1830-1831, and studies domestic and foreign policy aspects of the problem of incorporation of representatives of the Polish administrative elite into supreme legislative institutions of the Russian Empire. The purpose of the article is to study the transformation of the policy towards the Kingdom of Poland from constitutionalism and autonomy under Alexander I to the system of absolute monarchical government and bureaucratic centralization in the reign of Nicholas I in the context of the participation of Poles in the activities of the Council of State and of its departments and committees. In this regard, special attention is paid to the study of the mechanisms for formalizing the Russification program of autocratic power aimed at establishing a new status of the Kingdom of Poland and a new model of its administration developed by the Committee of Affairs for the Kingdom of Poland and by the Department for Affairs of the Kingdom under the Polish Council of State, determined the role of these Polish statesmen in their activities, primarily in the creation of the Organic Statute on February 14, 1832, and of specific legislative acts that determined the administrative, socio-economic, and financial integration of Polish lands into the empire. The article identifies the socio-political reasons for the failure of Nicholas I to use the "Polish potential" for solving imperial problems. It is demonstrated that the contradictions that existed between the government program aimed at abolishing the state-legal and financial autonomy of the Kingdom of Poland and the ideological setting of the dignitaries who considered it most important to preserve the Polish national identity and independence that underlaid their unwillingness to participate in the legislative activities of the imperial Council of State.

DT Article
DE South Caucasus; European Union; Nagorno-Karabakh; Armenia; Azerbaijan
AB The author applies the conflict transformation concept to analyse the policy of the European Union concerning the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict settlement. The practical significance of the work lies in the possibility to assess the demand for such an approach and its limitations. The research supplements the works of the authors dedicated to the settlement of ethno-political conflicts, referring to the specific stage in the development of the post-war settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The author argues that the steps taken by the EU are largely aimed at supporting the mediation process itself but not at reaching concrete results. To this end, the European Union concentrates its efforts on consultations with the conflict parties and the development of the local potential. The EU is not able to fully compensate for the deficit of the peace-building institutions. However, Brussels is successfully increasing its influence in the region. While not fully containing the outbreaks of military confrontation between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the participation of the EU in the negotiation process suggests the conflicting parties a direction for future peaceful development of the South Caucasus region. The significance of such conflict mediation cannot be overestimated, as the political leadership of both countries are not inclined towards reaching consensus, despite numerous public claims about peaceful intentions. Progress is hardly possible without international observers during the negotiations on peace agreement and at the stage of its implementation. A demand for further international support in opening borders between the countries, building new communication, and transport channels, still exists.

AB International development aid in the format of economic assistance is a significant component of the global political and economic strategy of the United States, which has been and remains the world leader in terms of providing economic development aid. This aid is used, first and foremost, to achieve the country's national interests; however, with the advent of each new president, an adjustment takes place that changes the volumes, directions, and formats of assistance. This work is dedicated to examining US policies in the field of international cooperation for development. The issues of participation in this system and the evolution of the philosophy, goals and directions of assistance provided by the United States are considered. General issues of the development of the assistance system are touched upon. The period of Donald Trump's presidency is considered in detail, including the interaction of his administration with legislators, as well as the transformation that took place in the field of development assistance with the advent of Joseph Biden. Based on a comparison of data on budget requests and decisions made on financing international assistance, the main conclusions about the inertia of the American development assistance system are formulated.

AB The author examines the role of the European Social Dialogue (ESD) in decision-making on social policy and labour relations at supranational level in the EU. She looks into the history and distinctive features of the ESD, its formats, procedures and legal framework. Based on a review of the institutionalization of social dialogue at the national level in the EU-27, two conclusions are drawn. The first is that the development of social dialogue is uneven across the Union because of the particularities of the members states social models and their political and socio-economic development. The second is that, despite national differences, the coverage of workers by collective agreements in the EU as a whole and the entrenchment of social dialogue at the supranational level make it an integral and distinctive feature of the European social model. An analysis of the evolution of the ESD suggests that there has been a continual move towards more autonomous status for the social partners. However, as a consequence of the 2008-2010 crisis, the ESD's role has been significantly weakened. "A New Start for Social Dialogue" announced by the Juncker's Commission and a number of further initiatives are largely declarative. The Court of Justice's 2021 decision limiting the scope for implementing autonomous agreements at the communitarian level can have a negative impact on the further development of the ESD. The author positively assesses the potential role of the ESD in overcoming the social consequences of internal and external challenges and the negative effects of the labour markets transformation.

   unions; wage regulation; tariff system; wage equalization; labor
   incentives; measurement of inequality; OGPU information department
AB During the NEP years, the task of regulating wages of industrial workers was one of the priorities of Soviet social policy. Wages at state-owned enterprises during the NEP period were regulated by the state, which was supposed, on the one hand, to implement the new principles of social policy (a policy towards equalizing wages), and on the other hand, to ensure production efficiency. The main tools for regulating wages were the tariff scale and terms of collective agreements. The policy pursued by the state regarding wages of industrial workers during the NEP years and the practice of its implementation are considered in this article, as is the reaction of workers to the ongoing processes of regulating the differentiation of wages among both skilled and unskilled workers. It is shown that no consistent equalizing (leveling) of workers' wages was achieved. The workers' attitude to the policy pursued in this area is analyzed on the basis of declassified materials from a multivolume publication of documents-information reviews and summaries of the Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU). Various forms of protest and discontent of workers regarding the regulation of wages are identified, which manifested themselves in different groups of workers, in different regions of the country, at enterprises of different industries, and for different reasons. The most characteristic ones were conflict situations generated by the policy of equalizing wages, which meant a decrease in labor motivation for skilled workers and caused their dissatisfaction.

AB The sanctions introduced by the United States and other Western countries after the beginning of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine were intended, along with the military assistance to Ukraine, as the major instrument in countering Russia's actions. These measures were aimed not only against the Russian state and its military potential and encompassed not only targeted individual and sectoral sanctions, but affected the population at large. The article covers the period from February till the end of 2022 and is focused on the industries most closely related to this country's military-political stance: the finance sector, the oil and gas exports, the metallurgy, transportation, defense production, and high tech. Special attention is given to secondary sanctions which had the goal to prevent Russia from bypassing restrictions and creating alternative schemes to sell its sanctioned goods, accomplish financial transactions and receive the components and technologies it needed. Various viewpoints on the consequences of the sanctions for the Russian economy and policy are described, as well as for the European and global market and international relations at large.

AB This article examines various aspects of identities conveyed by urban populations, factors of transformation and development of urban spaces, and historical memory as tools for the socialization, stratification, and integration of a polyethnic society in the Repub-lic of Sakha (Yakutia). The empirical base of the study is a variety of material, including a questionnaire survey of the urban popula-tion of Yakutia, spontaneous polls, and in-depth expert interviews. The novelty is the research strategy itself, aimed at identifying all the listed actors through the prism of symbolic representations. The study of the symbolic value of the northern cities of Yakutia as infor-mational and cultural spaces, understanding the heritage as a certain mediative mental-material cultural layer with symbolic codes and texts, provides key registers for considering the fundamental prob-lems of the spatial and socio-cultural development of territories in general. The results of the study show that the political identity of the population of Yakutia has been formed according to the historical memory of the Soviet past. A trend towards positioning the region as "northern" or "arctic" has emerged in recent years, which also depends on government policy in the Arctic.

   processes among young people
SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-PRAVO-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF LAW
LA Russian
DT Article
DE mass culture; digitalization; hybrid information warfare; escapism;
   morality
AB The article analyses the socio-cultural preconditions of the cult of aggression and destructive processes in the modern youth environment. The authors point out that the ongoing global hybrid war of information is using the levers of mass culture for its own purposes. The Internet has become one of its main spokespeople and its main advantage - the high speed of spontaneous dissemination of information. In essence, it is about the purposeful formation of a new type of terrorist by the ideologists of terrorist organizations through the distortion of consciousness and worldview. Further the authors specify the marked chronological sequence of application to Russian youth of technologies of management of masses from 2014 to 2021.
   Such technologies have been organically incorporated into mass Internet culture, not least because of the new ideal of young people - the anti-hero who challenges the system and destroys their enemies exclusively by force. In society today there is a desire for individualism, for isolation.
   Instead of critical analysis, cliched thinking, born and bred by a crisis of ideals, dominates today. An example is the now booming genre of superhero cinema. Bright heroes in equally bright and grotesque costumes battle some alien evil, destroying half of their own world along the way. It's a dumbing down of sensuality, a domination of form over content, a cliched shell that hides a reverse morality of permissiveness. And this is one of the tenets of terrorist movements and destructive ideologies.
   In order to confirm these theses, the authors conducted criminological research aimed at identifying the causes of the distortion of the moral image of modern society and moral categories in mass culture. The relationship between the moral values of individuals and their impact on the crime situation in society was studied.
   The study was conducted among teachers and students of the College of Altai State University. The respondents were also teachers from the Department of Criminal Law and Criminology at the Law Institute and the Department of Social Philosophy, Ontology and Theory of Knowledge at the Institute of Mass Communication, Philosophy and Political Science. A total of 330 respondents, aged 18-25 (students), 30-45 (teachers) were randomly sampled.
   The results confirmed the authors' hypothesis that the cult of power propagated by the mass media provoked a spontaneous social contamination, which was met by a surge of violent acts of a terrorist nature. Hybrid confrontation between states and uncontrolled, and often encouraged, terrorist activities in the digital sphere have given rise to an aggressive ideal of the hero of our time. Combating this triad requires a solid ideological basis in the anti-terrorist sphere, created through the joint efforts of the state and civil society institutions.

DT Article
DE US policy; Turkey; Ukraine; Black Sea region; energy security
AB The article identifies Washington's priorities in the process of implementing its policy towards Turkey in the context of the Ukrainian crisis. It analyzes the ways and means for the increased interest in Ukraine coming from both the United States and Turkey. In the last two decades, Turkey has gained its foreign policy independence, allowing to assert itself as a leading country in Eurasia. A new political alignment on the international arena, caused by the current weakening of the US positions, contributed to Turkish search for new allies on the post-Soviet space in order to strengthen its influence both in this area and throughout the world. Thus, Ukraine which has become of great importance both for Western countries in general and the United States in particular turned into one of these allies. In the situation of the severe competition for global influence Ukraine has become one of the key priorities of the post-Soviet countries, capable of providing desirable access to the Black Sea with its importance growing from day to day in the current situation and building suitable logistics there in order to establish a closer link for connecting Europe with Asia. Meanwhile, Turkey's intention to become one of the world's key powers will depend not only on the implementation of Ankara's ambitious policy in Ukraine, but also on the US position, which can be adjusted to Turkey's rapidly growing independence.

AB Proceeding from the book "Riddle, Mystery, and Enigma Two Hundred Years of British-Russian Relations" by former UK Foreign Secretary D. Owen (1977.1979), the article outlines the nature of Russia-UK relations, the ways they evolved in the course of the history, and the major contradictions that lay the foundation for the strategic thinking of the UK establishment towards Russia. Using the conventional methodology of realism and neo-realism, as well as the concepts of "national interest", "security", "geopolitical" and "personal factor", the author addresses the crisis both countries are going through. The article highlights the UK's special historical role in the European landscape, that now claims to fill a special place in the Euro-Atlantic security. The competitive nature of UK-Russia relations, the lack of trust and the declining significance of the Russian direction for Britain at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries have led today to a systemic lack of mutual understanding and the deep crisis brought about by the different interpretations of the world's political landscape and the place of both countries in it.

AB The article deals with German policy toward Uranian refugees. In 2022, European Union encounter a flow of refugees from Ukraine. The author analyses how European and German immigration policies have changed in comparison with refugee crisis in 2015. 2016. According to public opinion polls, political speeches, and legislative measures the majority of population and elites of EU und Germany support reception of refugees from Ukraine. The solidarity of the EU member states in support of Ukrainian refugees allowed them to develop a policy toward refugees. Temporary Protection Directives and Guidelines for border checks - in unprecedentedly short time. With Germany combining humanitarian policy and economic goals, Berlin seeks to alleviate the shortage of qualified labor force. In order to reveal impact of the reception of Ukrainian refugees on German political field the author explores Ukrainian diaspora, their representation in political elites, and electoral preferences. The analysis of Bundestag and Government data identifies that Ukrainian diaspora is not represented in these branches of power. Ukrainian NGO and associations do not influence German society and decision-making process. Thus, the influence of Ukrainian refugees on German politics could be insignificant. However, the problem of refugees will encourage a critical discourse towards Russia.

AB The paper comes up with a synchronous-diachronic analysis of the linguistic situation in one of the isolated cultural and linguistic enclaves of the Balkan Peninsula: the district of Xanthi in the region of Thrace in Northern Greece, on the Bulgarian-Greek border. Here, in a remote mountainous area, live Muslim Slavs, ethnic Bulgarians, representing a minority ethnolinguistic and cultural-confessional group that has existed for a long time in a foreign language and other religious environment among Orthodox Greeks. In the historical past, this community formed a single whole with the Muslim Bulgarians who now live within the boundaries of the Republic of Bulgaria. This minority is the object of the language and cultural policy of three states: Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria. Note that the Greek authorities for a long time 1920s-1990s (excluding the period of Bulgarian rule in 1941-1944) pursued a policy of de-Bulgarization of this population. As a result, today the degree of its Turkicization (due to the influence of Islam, the study of the Koran in Turkish and the active position of Turkey) is quite high. It should be noted that the Bulgarian-speaking communities in Northern Greece are not the object of the Bulgarian language policy, which is carried out by disinterested officials and politicians who ignore the opinions and assessments of Bulgarian dialectologists and sociolinguists. The study focuses on ethnonyms and exonyms as important factors in the formation of the Pomaks' linguistic identity: the self-name of the speakers of these dialects is Pomaks, Ahryans. The ethnonym Pomaks was introduced and continues to be actively used to discuss the new Greek policy towards the Bulgarian-speaking population of Greece; the linguonym Pomaks was also formed from it. Earlier in Greece, the term Slavophones ('speakers of the Slavic language') was used, cf. new pomakophones. In the 90s of the 20th century and early 21th century a number of scientists (V. Friedman, A. D. Dulichenko, A. Ioannidou, K. Voss, M. Nomati, M. Henzelmann, K. Steinke) considered Pomak to be one of the literary microlanguages of the southern Slavia, noting that it is characterized by the diversity of the script used and poor functionality. There were appropriate grounds for this (codification, publication of dictionaries and grammar, textbooks, etc.). But the impetus for the "creation" of the literary language of the Pomaks was the political task of the country's leadership. At present, Pomak (Southern Rodhopian, Bulgarian) dialects in Greece have an unwritten character (they are used exclusively for oral communication in the family and village, microsociety). Despite the presence of certain signs of the formation of the literary language among the Pomaks, the modern language situation and language policy do not contribute to its existence and functioning. We rely on both published sources and our own field materials collected during two ethnolinguistic expeditions carried out in 2018 and 2019, as well as online in 2021, and will try to present preliminary results of the study of the current state of the language and language policy. Let us note the importance of modern interdisciplinary approaches to the study of the phenomenon of intercultural communication, which are based on the dialogue of languages and cultures, and which necessitated the description of new linguistic conditions and consideration of the importance of not so much Greek as Turkish as a means of intra - and interethnic communication in the specific geopolitical conditions prevailing in this region.

AB The main vectors of the US foreign policy strategy regarding the countries of Central Asia (CA) after the collapse of the Soviet Union are analyzed. It is noted that there are three main vectors in the US strategy in Central Asia: geopolitical, economic, and political-ideological, and humanitarian, which in many cases are closely intertwined with each other. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are of the main interest to the United States there. The authors draw attention to the fact that the US strategy in this region has an obvious anti-Russian and anti-Chinese orientation, which has intensified during the crisis of 2021-2022, caused by the refusal of the United States and its allies to meet the legitimate claims of the Russian Federation adequately to ensure its security.

AB The "Operational Plan of the Baltic Sea Naval Forces in the event of the European War " dated 1912, with which the Russian Navy entered the First World War, is reviewed; the concept, operational structure, and tasks to the fleet units are analyzed. Strengths of the document include the principle of concentrating forces in a crucial line of action and complex use of heterogeneous forces; weaknesses are single-optionness, passive-expectant nature of actions, not quite rational operational formation of the fleet, lack of operational perspective, and poor coordination with ground forces and allies. The conclusion is made that the plan became a certain stage in the development of naval art and evidence of the creative approach to the search of forms and methods of "asymmetric " counteraction to a superior adversary. However, from the military and political point of view the document turned out to be untenable, as it was based on the only and, moreover, the least probable international political combination.

AB The political and economic decoupling of the United States and China is an integral part of the new reality in international relations, forming and defining the contours of the future world order. In the context of the aggravation of international tensions associated with the start of Russia's special military operation in Ukraine, it is necessary to consider the trajectories of further separation of the two largest superpowers. This study focuses on what potential changes may occur because of the current phase of transformation of the system of international relations. This article analyzes how far China is ready to go in its support of Russia in its confrontation with the West. This confrontation has an unprecedented character affecting US-Chinese relations.

AB The US Missile Defense Review (MDR) draws attention as a central document in this area. The two reviews published so far (2010 and 2019) within a year of the Nuclear Posture Review were an important addition to the National Defense Strategy. The latter is devoted to clarifying Washington's political-military course, and the Nuclear Posture Review, the MDR, and the Space Posture Review deal with the most important elements of the military policy of the United States. Taking into account the positions expressed by the Biden administration officials, conclusions are drawn about the content of the 2022 MDR. In addition, the prospects for the implementation of certain areas of the US missile defense policy are assessed, taking into account the practices of 2002-2021. If the current document is made the same way as previous ones, then it covers five main topics-missile threats, homeland missile defense, regional missile defense, program organization, and cooperation with allies. The Biden administration's two budget requests for missile defense (FY2022 and FY2023) suggest a course of action. In general, the new approach to the development of missile defense being applied can provide tangible results in the face of a possible reduction in funding. The role of allies in regional missile defense architectures may increase as a result of the interpretation of the experience of the use of missiles and air and missile defense systems.

DE departmental contradictions; sectionalism; economic regionalization;
   Leningrad; late Stalinism; Fourth Five-Year Plan
AB The attitudes, intentions, and actions of the Leningrad Communist Party organization, aimed at preserving Leningrad's economic exclusivity and raising the status of the city within the Soviet command economy of the second half of the 1940s, are analyzed. Some cases of conflicts of interest between the Leningrad Oblast Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks (AUCP(B), VKPB) and the central government, all-Union departments, and other industrial regions of the Soviet Union are considered. The published material shows the presence of certain trends in the economic development of the Northwest that were gaining strength even under the command economy of the Soviet Union. The postwar development trend chosen (or perhaps simply understood) by the Leningrad Oblast Committee managed to withstand the political repressions of 1949, the numerous subsequent changes in the personal composition of the regional elites, the transformation of the political power system after 1953, and the economic reforms of the late 1950s. The events under description are an example of a little-studied phenomenon, Soviet regionalism. By the example of Leningrad, we see how the leaders of the Soviet industrial center formed a "pressure group " to uphold the economic exclusivity of their city within the all-Union planned economy. Further study of such phenomena in relation to both Leningrad and other industrial centers of the Soviet Union (the Urals, Donbass, central regions, Far East, etc.), comparing them with each other, and analyzing the conflicts of interest that accompanied them at various levels create some prospects for the study of the history of Soviet regional policy and the late Stalinist Soviet Union from new-territorial and economic-positions.

Three definite periods can be distinguished in the NEP historiography: the Soviet stage, the Perestroika period, and the post-Soviet phase. At the same time, each period is characterized by a specific political situation, which left an imprint both on the degree of relevance and the priority of certain subjects in the study of NEP and on the methodological approaches to the study of these subjects. The author believes that, in the future, the most promising NEP studies will focus on the interface of areas: economic history and social history, economic history and the history of state institutions, military history and social history, etc.

AB The article examines the size and political and legal status of the Russian diaspora in China on the eve of the First World War, the features of the relationship of Russian subjects-ordinary citizens (peasants, employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER), other Russian and joint Sino-Russian enterprises in China) and Russian diplomats-with local residents and authorities. Sino-Russian interstate relations, problems, and achievements of Russian foreign policy in the Far East and Central Asia are analyzed. Particular attention is paid to clarifying the balance of colonialism and equality in the policy of the Russian Empire towards China. The author introduces the concept of "parallel colonizations, " which consists, on the one hand, of the implementation of the strategic goals of Russian policy by traditional means and methods of state diplomacy and, on the other hand, the spontaneous penetration of Russian peasants and merchants into China, which intensified on the eve of the First World War, creating settlements and trading posts practically autonomous from the Russian authorities.

DE narrative analysis; narrative structure; literary text
AB Narrative analysis of literary works enables to interpret present-day narrative texts in all their multi-level depth making use of the tools accumulated in science especially if those texts concern current and topical political events, which are usually spoken about in the language of media discourse. Change in the state (inner and outer) and presence of a narrator having his/her personal viewpoint and, consequently, the specific language of his/her message are signs of a narrative structure. The subject for consideration in this article based on Zakhkhok by Vladimir Medvedev and To Live On by Narine Abgaryan is key levels of the narrative text organization needed for such analysis. The texts chosen for the research are similar in subject matter (military conflicts in the post-Soviet space caused by the collapse of the USSR) and in the author's strategy - to include characters' personal destinies into the social history of the country and further to try and conceive them as part of the cultural code of the nation. The peculiarity of the author's view is the awareness of war not as a completed event but as a still lasting state, which permeates, deforms and destroys people's destinies as well as destinies of whole nations. In Medvedev's novel those are mainly voices of young men, immediate participants of the turbulence, that are heard; in Abgaryan's book those are voices of Armenian women, mothers, wives, and widows. Medvedev's style is tougher and more dynamic, collision unfolding before our eyes. In Abgaryan's story the plot is not that important: all key events were in the past, and characters are just recalling them. The code of the narrative discourse specified by the narrator's type determines the stylistics of the text, the nature of action, the interpretation of events: they rapidly change one another by means of the efforts of the narrators who were placed in the centre of military and domestic conflicts in Medvedev's novel. Abgaryan's characters are slow and quiet, their long and difficult life gives them hardwon wisdom to accept reality as it is in its bitter completeness. Personal dramas of the characters are involved in the overall tragedy of the whole nation which goes beyond a specific era; this enables the author to reveal the ethno-cultural determinants of the narrative identity. Common grief can be overcome by means of love, work, patience and the cultural capital which manifests itself in people's mentality and way of life and makes it possible for them to survive and gain a new cultural identity. Collective tragedy (social history), which opens to a reader through the characters' destinies (personal narrative), becomes part of epic history (meta-narrative). This author's strategy gives the stories told a timeless scale and ontological depth.

AB The reasons for the creation of the Japanese-American Military-Political Alliance and the factors that were conductive for its existence after the conclusion in 1951 of the first Treaty on Security Guarantees between Japan and the Unites States are analyzed. The present successor of this treaty, the Treaty on Mutual Cooperation and Security between Japan and the Unites States, which was concluded in 1960, constitutes the foundation of alliance relations between Tokyo and Washington. The content of these treaties, the obligations of the participants according the articles of the treaties, and the evolution of the interpretations of these mutual obligations in accordance with changes in the international situation and in relations in the Asia-Pacific region are considered. Finally, the growing possibilities for Japan to play a more independent role in this bilateral alliance and the reasons why Tokyo has not taken steps to explore them are evaluated.

AB This article addresses the discussions in the European Union that broke out in the frames of the Conference on the future of Europe and after its closing. The author consistently analyzes the positions of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, while identifying differences between both EU institutions and Member States. The stumbling block is the prospects for the EU institutional reform, which can be carried out both by changing the Treaty on the European Union and without convening the Convention, but only by applying the "passerelle" clause, which provides an opportunity to move from unanimity to voting by qualified majority in the Council on a number of important issues. The author emphasizes that an additional motivation for the European Parliament to call for cancelling of unanimity was the threat of blocking sanctions against Russia by certain countries. The second part of the article examines the development of the idea of the European Political Community (EPC), put forward by French President Macron at the end of the Conference. The author argues that the plans to create the EPC as a "light legal structure with decision-making powers" are directly related to implementation of institutional reform, namely, unanimity cancelling. Thus, scientific and political discussions are conducted around fundamental directions-the relationof deepening and expanding European integration.

AB The results of the presidential and parliamentary elections in France in 2022, which took place in specific conditions caused by the increase in energy and socio-economic problems in the country against the background of military operations in Ukraine, are analyzed. Despite the re-election of President E. Macron for a second term, the loss of an absolute pro-government majority in the National Assembly (the lower house of the French Parliament) following the parliamentary elections significantly complicated the implementation of his election program. In particular, the inability, as before, constantly to use article 49-3 of the Constitution of the country to adopt laws, in fact contrary to the opinion of deputies, required the President and the government to start searching for compromises and possible allies, as well as to adjust the political course. However, the significant strengthening of nonsystemic political forces in the lower house of Parliament, both the far-left Unconquered France and, especially, the far-right National Rally, coupled with the reluctance of The Republicans to enter into a coalition with the presidential majority, complicates the plans of the Head of State. The prospects of further evolution of the country's party-political system, as well as the preparation of the main political forces of the country for the next electoral cycle of 2027, are considered.

   industrial organizations; civil law; powers of attorney; loans;
   nationalization
AB The legal mechanisms of business regulation in the Urals, Siberia, and the Far East under anti-Bolshevist governments are considered. The political and economic context of events of the Civil War in the eastern part of Russia is analyzed. The policy of the government towards restoring the rights of owners and the relative freedom of entrepreneurship, the provision of a network of commercial and industrial organizations, and the presence of a large number of lawyers in the supreme and central governing bodies of the anti-Bolshevist governments became major prerequisites for strengthening the role of legal regulators of business activity. In the eastern part of Russia, legal grounds were developed to continue the functioning of commercial and industrial institutions, which had lost contact with their legal owners or parent institutions. State power was expended and prolonged by the authorities, replacing the proxy and creating a temporary entity with the rights to enter transactions on behalf of the owner, including making financial commitments. The demands of government bodies for the full payment of debts by the owners, including the period when they had not managed their enterprises under the Soviet regime, were perceived as an injustice and an obstacle to the revival of industry, as was the desire not to subsidize the restoration of production activities, crediting them on commercial terms instead. However, the Civil War forced the authorities to restrict the rights of owners and their representatives to dispose of their property freely. It is crucially important that such restrictions were reversible and could be lifted upon exiting the emergency circumstances. Cases are also presented when anti-Bolshevist governments nationalized the property of private and cooperative enterprises, and the reasons for such decisions are analyzed.

AB Recent developments in expert discourse regarding transformations of the welfare state and its future are discussed. The research field embraces international organizations' visions and national strategic program documents of members of the Wellbeing Economy Governments partnership (New Zealand, Scotland, Iceland, Wales, and Finland), international rankings data, expert discussion papers, and research literature. The wellbeing economy model-the key focus in this discussion-is part of the sustainable development framework, and its advocates and supporters seek to contribute to the mainstream discourse on development. These models are now facing severe systemic limitations, due to emerging challenges in the context of resource scarcity and growing international and political tensions. Promoting universal models appears to be an unsustainable challenge; in an international environment of "unsustainable development, " a reference framework for development relies on a diversity of approaches to progress in wellbeing and on principles encompassing a dialogue culture and on responsible commitment.

DT Article
DE European Union; Eastern Partnership; European Neighborhood Policy;
   financing; Ukraine; Georgia; Moldova; Poland
AB The Eastern Partnership as one the European Union's external activities is rarely analyzed through the prism of financing. At the same time, the analysis of instruments, volumes, dynamics and structure of financing allows not only to assess the efficiency of the funds spent in partner countries, but also to identify the real place of the Eastern Partnership in the structure of the EU foreign policy priorities. The aim of the study is to define the true role of partnership in the foreign policy of the Union. Analyzing the main directions and instruments of financing has resulted in a number of conclusions. Firstly, in terms of funding, the Eastern Partnership is inferior in importance not only to other countries and regions, which receive financial aid within the framework of the EU official development assistance, but also to the Southern Neighborhood. Secondly, the evolution of instruments has led to a further decrease in this role and the actual dissolution of financing the Eastern Partnership in the system of the EU official development assistance. Hence, we can conclude that the political component prevails over the economic one in case of the Eastern Partnership. Thirdly, the recipient countries within the framework of the program are clearly divided into two groups, based on the intensity of funding, and a larger amount of funds correlates not so much with the fulfillment of economic conditions, but with political loyalty and a demonstration of a pro-European foreign policy vector. Fourthly, even in the main beneficiary countries, the effectiveness of financing is very limited, since it does not lead to implementation of the stated goals. All this allows us to draw the key conclusion that the EU, within the framework of the Eastern Partnership, continues to build global regimes, the neighborhood being one of them. That is why the financing is aimed rather at stabilizing this neighborhood than at its active development.

DT Article
DE Visegrad Group; military conflict in Ukraine; refugees; humanitarian
   aid; military aid
AB An attempt is made to analyze the origins of the attitude of Central European countries to the current military conflict in Ukraine, as well as their historical fears and concerns that broke out against the background of Moscow's proposals to return the European security system to the contours of 1997, which preceded the armed invasion on February 24, 2022. It was historical memory that largely formed the knowingly predictable position of these countries in the conflict and their unconditional support of the Ukrainian side. According to the author, the conflict overall contributed to the pro-Atlantic consolidation of the Central European region, deepened the gap in relations with Russia, and produced new nuances in relations within the Visegrad region. Nevertheless, the understanding of the importance of regional solidarity, strengthened over 30 years of democratic development, keeps the Visegrad Group countries together, preventing them from falling victim one by one to any of the modern geopolitical poles. In defining the events, particularly the essence of the military conflict in Ukraine, the author adheres to the terminology used in the political space of the region under analysis, which allows her to remain objective in describing what is happening.

DE Russian Civil War; NEP; social policy of the Bolsheviks; populist
   slogans based on the ideas of social justice; discrimination and class
   approach; revolutionary legal consciousness
AB A series of 100th anniversaries of recent years (the First World War, the Revolution of 1917, the Russian Civil War, the introduction of the NEP) has stimulated historians and representatives of related sciences (sociologists, philosophers, political scientists, culturologists, economic historians, etc.) to summarize the study of this turning point for the national history of the period, which is increasingly often regarded as homogeneous ( "the time of wars and revolutions "), as well as its immediate consequences, stretching back to the 1920s and 1930s. The works published within the framework of the anniversaries and the discussions that flared up around them more clearly exposed the least studied and controversial aspects of the problems and made it possible to identify urgent tasks for the future. Quite expectedly, the focus was on subjects such as rethinking the causes of the revolutionary events and the role of various social groups in them; comparison of the events of February and October 1917, the degree of discontinuity and continuity of processes and the existence of alternative ways of Russia's development; characteristics of the armed forces and political movements opposed to the Bolsheviks; the relation of "red " and "white " terror; problems of social stratification in postrevolutionary Russia and the relationship between the concepts of former people, the socially alien, economically dangerous elements, NEPmen; etc. In addition, summarizing the results of studying the revolution and its consequences has contributed to the revival of conceptual discussions about totalitarianism, the social base of the Soviet regime of the 1920s-1930s, and the features of the formation of civil society in Russia, as well as about the conditions for the formation and specifics of the "welfare state " of the Soviet type. At the same time, one should admit that the problem of the social policy of the Bolsheviks, which directly relates to many of the above conceptual or debatable issues, remained practically outside the framework of scientific, historical, and political discussions. Meanwhile, for example, the outcome of the Civil War and the further fate of Russia were largely determined by the nature and priorities of the social policy of the warring parties, the degree of the attractiveness of their slogans for ordinary people in the rear and at the front, as well as the ability to bring these slogans to life. The problems of continuity with the pre-Soviet past of the country, the novelty and relevance for society of the Bolsheviks' transformations in the social sphere, and their compliance with the global trends of the era also seem key to understanding many debatable issues of early Soviet history. In particular, it is impossible to answer the question about the presence or absence of elements of civil society and the so-called "welfare state " in Soviet Russia without an objective assessment of the social slogans declared by the state and the methods of their implementation, as well as the nature of the interaction between the authorities and society in solving certain topical tasks.

Particular attention is paid to the emperor, his inner circle, representatives of the highest bureaucracy, and deputies of the State Duma involved in the political decision-making process. The question of the forms of interaction, everyday practices of cooperation between deputies and officials is considered. However, these forms of cooperation coexisted with the ineradicable conflicts characteristic of the lawmaking system of the early 20th century. The emperor and his inner circle did not become part of the emerging political class. This was a "fault line " that provoked crises both before and after 1914.

AB Against the backdrop of the modern Cold War, the instability threats the sources of which are located in the conflict-prone countries of Asia and Africa have not disappeared. One of the key tendencies is the structures of international terrorism in Western Africa, Horn of Africa, Near and partly Middle East being still in force. The article explores Germany's attempts to keep the strategic presence in Afghanistan and Mali in the context of previous efforts to resolve armed conflicts here. The choice is due to the FRG being in a position of moving towards the role of a full-fledged global player in political and military spheres. The "rising" power becomes especially susceptible both to the risks of instability projected on it and its partners, and to the loss of strategic influence in various regions of the world. The author explores in a comparative way different aspects of German participation in the missions in Afghanistan (ISAF, then "Resolute Support") and Mali (EUTM Mali and MINUSMA in parallel). The paper highlights political and military factors which determine the scale and forms of the Bundeswehr usage in the peacekeeping sphere during different stages of the resolution process. In Mali, Germany has tried to take into account and correct the mistakes in security sector reform conducted in Afghanistan. But at the same time, there were quite a few "narrow places" of EUTM Mali activity with FRG's role as a framework nation. The first factor of German positions' strategic vulnerability is dependence on a partner fully engaged in anti-terrorist combat operations. The second one is the critical perception of German efforts by the forces which have come to power in Afghanistan (Taliban) and Mali (local military officers) and have preferred the nationalization of armed conflict resolution. In this regard, the article concludes about German "anti-withdrawal" strategy.

AB The article analyzes Imperial Russia's policy towards the Kalmyk Khanate in the early-to-mid 1760s. The period witnessed a transfer of power, and the new ruler was to traditionally face the shaping of an opposing party. The latter was founded by noyons (landlords) of the Dorbet Ulus to be further joined by quite a number of smaller groups.
   The critical and persisting 'Dorbet' question had arisen from the years-long dynastic feuds of the 1720s-1730s, which led not only to a power shift but also to an increase in mutual annexations of commoners. The Collegium of Foreign Affairs approached the tie of reciprocal claims with a proposal that households (yurts) to have left their landlords after Donduk-Dashi ascended to the throne be duly returned.
   In the face of new conditions, Khoshut landlord Zamyan started requesting a permission to adopt sedentary life. The Collegium examined consequences of sedentarization and - though did meet that very request - tended to disapprove it for the whole Kalmyk people since that would result in decreased defensive capacities across southern frontiers of the country.

AB This article is focused on the "civilizational state" phenomenon, using India as a case study. The basic characteristics of the "civilizational state" are outlined, and the reasons behind the interest in societies such as India, China, Iran, etc., are given. Nowadays, the political self-assertion of "civilizational states" is a natural reaction to the "conceptual" crisis of globalism and to emerging trends towards the formation of a new, polycentric world order. The arising of India as a viable "civilizational state" is scrutinized. In this pivotal process, the role of the precolonial, colonial, and independence periods in the formation of modern Indian polity is assessed. The grounds for sustainability of the socio-economic and cultural dualism of Indian society are estimated. In conclusion, the operating of the "Indian political model" combining elements of representative governance and "competitive authoritarianism" is evaluated. The "axial" role of the state, both in domestic development and in the transition to a polycentric world order, is noted.

The creation of conditions for political and economic recovery in the Kingdom of Poland in 1815-1830 and the prospects for a general constitutional political reorganization meant that the illusions of national reconciliation and unification of the two peoples within common political borders after a long military confrontation were harbored by both sides, were very great, and affected public life.

DT Article
DE Regionalism; international relations; influence; conflicts;
   normalization; challenges; values; interests; Middle East
ID ARAB
AB The concept of regionalism is based on identity, i.e., the cultural, historical, political association of individuals, peoples, states, and leaders with a certain region. Regionalization is associated with institution building or the conclusion of formal agreements, which are sometimes substituted by informal ties. Regionalization in the Middle East is affected by quite contradictory trends since the region has always been considered a highly conflict-prone zone and not much amenable to change. The conflicts themselves have become the system-forming elements, which in their own way tightened this space and ensured the building of coalitions and alliances. Modern conflicts, most of which have become rapidly internationalizing intrastate confrontations, and the general increase in militarization are still eminent characteristics of the Middle East. At the same time, the trends towards the rapprochement of individual opponents and normalization are becoming clearer, and their further development could possibly play an integration role in the future. The involvement of both states and nonstate or quasi-state actors in these processes is noteworthy. There is a growing independence of the leading regional states, as well as an activation of small countries, driven by their national interests. The fragmentation of the Middle East does not mean the absence of internal ties and of interdependence of states, of common challenges, and of attempts to work out group strategies on certain issues. There is an ad hoc cohesion of individual organizations, new logistical and transport routes are being built, and trade and economic relations between individual countries are expanding.

The article highlights the situation in the Conservative Party, the course and results of the elections of its leaders, which demonstrated deep differences in the party, which deepened the systemic crisis in the party and in the country. The new government will have to act in the face of the negative consequences of Brexit for the country and the growing economic crisis with a decrease in the standards of living of the population. Labor's ratings have risen sharply amid the crisis in the ruling party. The transition of the throne to Charles III may cause a decline in the popularity of the institution of the monarchy in the UK.

DT Article
DE public diplomacy; hybrid warfare; information warfare; psychological
   operations; strategic communication; American-Russian relations; U.S.A.;
   soft power; POLWAR; ideological warfare; world order; Ukraine
AB In 2022, the tension between Russia and the U.S. has reached a new high. This trend has been especially noticeable in the information space: influencing public opinion of each other's populations as well as of global community. Focusing on the concept of "political warfare" (P01WAR), the author analyzes the circumstances of its last notable emergence in the discourse among the American expert community and political elites - the start of the Cold War. The article discovers that American approach to the POLWAR in the first decades of confrontation with the USSR was reactive and even defensive, since the USSR did already have a successful experience of projecting influence on the global public opinion, effectively winning hearts and minds of foreign populations and thus presenting a threat to the newly constructed liberal world order. Hence, the U.S. governments proceeded to a gradual establishment of what later will be called the American "public diplomacy" (PD), including the development of relative legislation, institutes, etc. Thus, the article concludes that PD as a political practice may be considered a product of the Cold War in general and POLWAR in particular, which explains why the American PD has been in systemic crisis since the end of the Cold War. Moreover, studying the latest changes in the U.S. legislation and institutes related to public diplomacy, the author suggests that those events were once again the reaction of the U.S. to the Russian policies which were considered a challenge to the "rule-based world order". Those steps, however, have been too inconsequent to bring the American PD into the most effective mode. That is why in the POLWAR that started in 2022, the American side fluctuates towards reactive and defensive tactic, mostly focusing on stopping Russian information campaigns influencing the population of the U.S., whereas control over the global public opinion remains second priority and public opinion of Russians is not being considered at all within the framework of this new approach of the U.S. Aside from that the creation of Disinformation Board and introduction of the concept of "domestic PD" likely indicate the desire to boost the public diplomacy resources that are not currently adequate for POLWAR offensive via discovering new talents and ideas among motivated Americans.

TI The university's new identity: The optics of the responsibility ethic
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE university; responsibility; technoscience; research; education; society
AB The central problem of the article is the issue of the essential characteristics of a contemporary responsible university. The fundamental justification for the existence of the university is to ensure the continuity of academic communication within its walls. Over the past decades, universities around the world have been undergoing significant transformations related, among other things, to the commodification of knowledge. In their hands is considerable power, which can be used both for good and for harm. Therefore, a university responsibility agenda aimed at ensuring that universities resist the temptation to abuse this power, to use their privileged position for private interests, is more relevant than ever. The article analyzes the problem of the responsibility of a modern university: to whom and for what is the university responsible today, and can it be considered as an agent of responsibility? For this purpose, ontological, scientific and technological, ethical and political components of the responsibility structure are identified and analyzed in the problematics of a responsible university. The ontological or existential responsibility of the university is associated with the embodiment of its key mission as a social institution that implements the "universalization of knowledge as a public good" (Steve Fuller); it, first of all, consists in ensuring the existence of the future for humankind. The scientific and technological aspect of the university's responsibility at the present stage is conditioned by the challenges of technoscience and by the transition to a new level of interaction between man and nature. Risks, the constantly growing uncertainty and unpredictability turn responsibility itself into a specific moral and socio-political task of organizing the life of a person and society. Under these conditions, the university does not just give the world what it wants; rather, it is a critical institution that takes an active expert position, it systematically explores the world, takes responsibility for the opening prospects. The ethical responsibility of the university, which transforms knowledge into a public good accessible to many, is implemented prima facie through educational activities. Attention is drawn to the particularly important role of social sciences and the humanities, which they should perform in the educational activities of the university, and which forms a position of a responsible attitude towards the future. The political component of the university's responsibility is closely related to the issues of university autonomy and academic freedom. Providing institutional autonomy and the possibility of free intellectual activity is a necessary condition for the preservation of the university as a space for critical thinking, vital for civilizational development.

AB Central Asia (CA) is one of the most important points of contention between US, Russia and China The article analyses a number of main directions of the US foreign policy strategy towards the countries of the region since the break-up of the Soviet Union. Contemporary conflict in Afghanistan and the spread of Islamic extremism significantly contribute to the growing interest of major nations in the stability of the adjacent countries. It is noted that there are three main aspects - geopolitical, economic, political-ideological and humanitarian, which in many cases closely overlap with each other. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are of the main interest to the United States. Rich natural resources of Kazakhstan (oil, gas, uranium) attract a lot of attention of the US, Russia and China Another direction is the promotion of democratic values and securing political influence, which is carried out by NGOs and US embassies. The authors draw attention to the fact that the US strategy in this region has an obvious anti-Russian and anti-Chinese orientation, which has intensified during the crisis of 2021-2022 caused by the refusal of the United States and its allies to adequately meet the legitimate demands of the Russian Federation to ensure its security.

DT Article
DE Feliks Volkhovsky; Ranunculus; Sibirskaya gazeta; essay; story
AB The article reveals the features of content and style of essays by Feliks Volkhovsky, who published them in Sibirskaya gazeta under the pseudonym Ranunculus. The thematic variety of the materials is analyzed; the images of "outback" and "little man", key to the essays, are considered. The first private Sibirskaya gazeta, published in Tomsk in 1881-1888, was the leading regional publication. It had a socio-political program, but at the same time was characterized by researchers as a "literature-centric" periodical. Over the eight years of existence, 355 literary and literary-journalistic materials were published in Sibirskaya gazeta. More than 100 of them were written by Volkhovsky, a Narodnik [populist] poet exiled to Siberia and the "secret editor" of the newspaper. During the period of cooperation with Sibirskaya gazeta, Volkhovsky most often wrote feuilletons - 76 pieces were published. His fictionalized materials were essays thematically and stylistically close to feuilletons - six texts. The aim of the study is to identify the features of content and style of the essays Volkhovsky published under the pseudonym Ranunculus. The "provincial essays" were published in 1882-1884 and are the only fully literary prosaic works by Volkhovsky in the newspaper. Essays pablished under the pseudonym Ranunculus in Sibirskaya gazeta are represented by two key thematic layers: the image of a "little man" and the description of human indifference, and the satirical image of the "outback" as a collective image of Siberia, a demonstration of the customs of the local people. In the framework of the holistic perception of Volkhovsky's essays, these layers are conflicting: a contrast is created between the tragedies of local "predators" and "little men", small squabbles and series of events leading characters to death. In Ranunculus' essays, the key image is that of the Siberian "outback", consisting of grotesque and realistic plans. Initially, Volkhovsky constructs the image of an "outback" as a village and province with fairy-tale motifs and characters, referring the reader to the city Glupov and the "urban" stories by Gogol. The second key motif for publicist is the existence of a "little man" in the "outback". Volkhovsky contrasts images of "mastodons" that personify their inner emptiness with images of people that have not completely lost their humanity, whose life circumstances, in the end, lead to death.

TI Security of Elections in European Parliament
SO CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE elections; European parliament; election security; interference in
   domestic political affairs
AB The article explores the European Union approaches to the problem of election security in the context of European Parliament elections. The topic is specifically relevant because in recent years Western democracies have made a lot of effort to counter foreign interferences, especially following turbulence around US presidential elections in 2016. In the European Union this topic was put on the top of the agenda in 2019 election cycle due to a number of external and internal factors and its importance is growing due to a number of reasons. The first reason is the growing role and status of EP among other European Union institutions. European Parliament is one of the key EU legislative bodies, and the only one elected directly by the citizens. The second reason is the rise of political activity in Europe, mostly because of younger generation and the use of information technologies in political processes. The turnout numbers during the recent elections in 2014 and 2019 demonstrate that this trend is most likely dominate in the 2024 elections as well. The third reason is the rise of European Union as an international relations actor. The EU becomes a stronger partner in relations with United States, and engages more in international affairs. The article aims to explain the threat perception in the European Union and investigate the measures taken in the EU against foreign interference in the elections to the European Parliament. Unfortunately, Russia is indicated as one of the most common sources of election security threats, and thus brings additional tensions to relations between Russia and European Union.

DT Article
DE Gabon; Central Africa; statehood; national unity; decolonization; rental
   economy; neocolonialism
AB The article deals with the Gabonese history in the years of postcolonial development. The author also examines the current socio-political situation in Gabon, a former French colony and France's stronghold in Central Africa. The Gabonese Republic celebrated sixty years of independence in 2020, as 1960 was proclaimed the "Year of Africa". Given the controversial regional and international context, attention is drawn to Gabon's peripheral and unequal status in the global economy and politics. Being rich in oil, gas, manganese, uranium, forests, water, other natural resources Gabon demonstrates deep economic and social imbalances. The country's economy is showing symptoms of the "Dutch disease": the discovery of significant reserves of natural resources has led to the outpacing development of the extractive industry to the detriment of other sectors, especially agriculture. Gabon occupies a relatively high position in the list of countries by the HDI though about a third of the Gabonese population is below the national poverty line. The article analyzes the problems of decolonization, regional integration, sovereignity, tribalism, nation-building, and the choice of the course towards capitalism, with almost no socialist ideas in Gabonese public discourse and, at the same time, flourishing concepts of "national unity" and "troisieme voie". The text also addresses the issues of statehood, ideology and institutions of power in independent Gabon while the France's presence in the African and Gabonese economy and politics seems purely neo-colonial. The article examines the process of establishment and functioning of the Bongo family political regime as well as the phenomenon of dynastic rule in a system with formal democracy.

DT Article

ID PARTY; JUSTICE
AB Since their formation, the parties of political Islam that exist today in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia were traditionally seen as the "voice of people" in authoritarian states, the means and the vanguard of social movement for a better life. In an attempt to enter political arena, while adapting to different challenges posed by their regimes as well as jihadi Islamism both domestically and regionally, these Islamist parties have undergone a number of transformations both in their ideology and relations with the regime. However, the crucial point of these transformations was becoming a part of the state that they had been aiming to change. After their short-lived electoral success, they find themselves in crisis. First, they are no longer perceived as a sociopolitical force that strives to voice concerns of the oppressed and to fight for their interests against the unjust regimes. Instead, they are now deeply associated with the "old guard", no less corrupt than the governments and the political elites, against whom people protest. Second, while they were trying to adapt democratic ideas to their narratives, they were moving further away from their Islamist identity. Third, they have learnt the constraints of their political capabilities: in order to preserve their legal status, they have to coopt with the regimes, but when they do they lose their public support, and when they resent this cooptation, the regimes force them to weakness and internal divisions, yet again causing loss of social base.

AB This article, the main theses of which were presented in the reports of the authors at the meeting of the RAS Presidium on February 9, 2022, is dedicated to a new configuration of the world order and the place of Russia and Africa in the changing world. The authors hold that it is time for Russia, which over the past 30 years has unsuccessfully sought to become part of the West, to abandon illusions and reconsider its foreign economic and foreign policy strategy, reorienting itself to states that are turning from outsiders into significant players in the international political and economic space and are willing to interact with our country on a mutually beneficial and equal basis. Certainly African countries are among such states. The strategies of old and new players on the African continent are analyzed, and the current areas of Russian-African cooperation in the short, medium, and long term are identified. The main mechanisms and tools necessary to intensify our interaction are revealed, including informational and financial-economic levers. According to the authors, the key area of our relations that could become attractive for African countries and contribute to the successful economic development of Russia may be the development of bilateral opportunities for technological partnerships.

AB The purpose of the article is a historiographic review of archaeological research of the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic of the Crimean Peninsula, published on the pages of the Bulletin of the Commission for the Study of the Quaternary Period for the period from the creation of the journal (1929) to the modern stage. In order to achieve the goal, it was envisaged to solve the tasks: to separate articles on primitive archaeology of Crimea from the whole array of scientific publications on collections, their subsequent chronological and nomination systematization; analytical characteristics of publications written on Crimean materials and related to the theme of the Stone Age; identification of general and specific in research and concretization of their importance for domestic archaeological science. The methodology of the study was based on the integrated application of scientific principles: historicism, objectivity, comparativehistorical approach, retroreflection. The problematic field of research included the following components: establishing continuity in the history of study of the Stone Age of the Crimean Peninsula, formulating priority problems of primitive archaeology of the region. The source base for the study was the work of scientists on the history of the Stone Age of Crimea, published on the pages of the Bulletin.
   During the study, the authors found that out of 77 issues of the Bulletin for the period from 1929 to 2019 only 20 numbers, chronologically falling during the period of the region's stay in Ukraine (1992 - 2014), objectively do not contain materials on primitive archaeology of Crimea. At the same time, the nomination groups of research of the Stone Age of Crimea represented almost all topical directions of modern primitive archaeology: general methodological and methodological issues; publishing data on known and new archaeological cultures of Crimea; works on the open and explored monuments of the primitive history of the peninsula; historical reviews and memoirs. Moreover, in the constantly changing socio-political and scientific-organizational conditions of the XX - the beginning of the XXI centuries, all publications remained characterized by an objective approach to the consideration of the problem, combined with a dynamic transition from the accumulative stage to the stage of material systematization and synthesis.
   Thus, the systematic and constant presence of "Crimean primitive topics" on the pages of the academic publication allows to trace and summarize the ideas about the complex ways of forming research on the Paleolithic, the Mesolithic and Neolithic Peninsula states; the stability of interest in the issues of primitive history of the region, containing important reference monuments of the Stone Age of Eastern Europe, the South of Russia and the Azov-Black Sea coast; to outline the prospects for a comprehensive study by the scientific community of the problems of anthropogenesis and sociogenesis of the oldest population of our country.

DT Article
DE Yemelyan Vershinin; family ties; service in Siberia; ambassadorial
   affairs
AB The aim of this study is to clarify the origin and ambassadorial activities of the little-known Tomsk equestrian Cossack Emelyan Vershinin, who made long trips to the rulers of the eastern states and Siberian nomadic formations. The study is based on published materials on the history of Russian-Mongolian and Russian-Chinese relations and on archival sources (tribute books) from the Siberian Prikaz of the Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts. In the early days of Siberian exploration it was important to establish ambassadorial and trade relations with neighbouring eastern countries. One of the active participants of Russian missions to "unpeaceful lands" and eastern countries was the Tomsk Cossack Yemelyan Vershinin, who came from a hereditary military environment. The purpose of his journeys was to bring the warlike nomads into Russian citizenship and to settle disputes with the rulers of independent states. Vershinin made his first trip to the Mongol ruler Altyn Khan in 1634 as part of the diplomatic mission of the boyar's son S. Grechaninov. In the autumn of 1638 he was sent to the "Kyrgyz land" to the Yenisei princes Ishey and Koyan to persuade the nomadic owners to "obey" and take sherti (oath of allegiance to the Russian sovereign). In 1640 Vershinin headed a diplomatic mission to the first Kalmyk khan Daichin (Taichi-Taishi), son of the famous Oirat taisha Urlyuk, who roamed the upper reaches of the Irtysh and the Yaik. Demonstrating his independence from the Russian tsar, Daichin kept the Tomsk envoys in his dominion for three years. Having found themselves in "captivity", the Russian ambassadors were forced to travel with Daichin's caravan to Trukhmenkala (a city in Turkmenistan), then visited the Bukhara cities of Samarqand and Tashkent, and the Chinese border town Xining. While in Xinin, Vershinin met with Chinese officials and received a letter to the Russian authorities, which due to the lack of interpreters in the Siberian Prikaz was not read. Upon his return to Tomsk, Vershinin presented a report on the results of his stay in the Oirats' land, Central Asia and China. Vershinin's further service was marked by a trip to the Teleut prince K. Abakov with a statement of peace initiatives coming from the Russian authorities. The study concludes that the establishment of political and commercial relations with "foreign" rulers at an early stage of Siberian development allowed the Russian authorities to avoid major military conflicts, typical of Western states in the era of colonial conquests, and to form policies contributing to strengthening Russia's influence on its eastern borders and transforming it into a powerful Eurasian state.

In a solid publication, an international team of authors presented their vision of the causes of Brexit and its impact on the future of London's relations with the outside world, individual regions within the country (including the overseas territory of Gibraltar) and the search for a new foreign policy identity, still defined through the imperial component. Analyzing this monograph, the author of the article turns to the little-known concept of "Greater Britain" in Russian historiography and the reasons for the actualization and forms of manifestation of the imperial syndrome in the format of the new foreign policy setting "Global Britain". The text focuses on the relationship between the two concepts, including through the migration factor and the concept of the "British World". The resuscitation of old ideas and the emergence of new terms in modern scientific discourse in relation to British realities is explained by the complex and contradictory search for an adequate response of the country to the challenges of recent years (Brexit, pandemic, populism, political crises within the country) and the changing configuration of the balance of forces on the world stage in a transitional era. London is trying to find its place in a changed world by trial and error, using both old proven approaches (for example, playing the anti-Russian card) and modeling new alliances for it in priority regions of the world. Unfortunately, there is no special section or any serious mention of Russia in the monograph (but there is a chapter devoted to relations with China). Although Brexit has had an impact on Russian-British relations in the direction of their deterioration. London has been actively playing and continues to play the anti-Russian card to increase the rating of the Conservative Party and individual politicians. At the same time, it is in the imperial plane between Britain and Russia, as a kind of alter ego of each other, that certain patterns can be seen, similar difficulties in parting with empires and building relationships with former territories.

AB The article analyzes the activities of the youth environmental movement "Fridays for Future" initiated in 2018 by the Swedish student Greta Thunberg. The features of its network structure, positive and negative factors for the development of the community that arise from this structure are emphasized. The novelty of the presented work consists in the analysis of the distinguishing factors of this initiative from the youth units of traditional public associations. Firstly, officially the "Fridays" were not created by any of the previously operating "adult" organizations. Secondly, this movement of teenagers has gained mass character in many countries of the world. Thirdly, it has become a symbol of a real, almost breakthrough and widespread promotion of the climate agenda. The purpose of the article is, on the one hand, to show which features of the movement strengthen it and can sometimes serve as an example for "adult" organizations. On the other hand, it is to outline the circle of threats to its participants and to the agenda for which they are fighting with all the force of youthful maximalism. The network structure, the availability of the necessary technologies, the absence of formalism and hierarchy creates all the prerequisites for the rapid numerical growth and popularity of the "Fridays". However, the same traits form a breeding ground for various kinds of manipulations and provocations. In order to successfully promote teenage protests, it is necessary to maintain a strict balance, which can be disrupted by manifestations of radicalism. The author emphasizes the fact that the "baggage" of social activity accumulated at such a young age will be taken by the participants of the "Fridays" into the future. Currently, they are building connections and gaining experience unthinkable for previous generations, which will affect not only the political situation down the road. The type of society formed of such elements in the future may differ significantly from the usual, traditional one.

DE Great French Revolution; conservative movement; black hundred;
   journalism
AB The purpose of the study is to identify the possibility of continuity of the views of Russian conservative leaders of the era of Alexander II and conservative publicists of the period of social and political upheavals of the early 20th century on the history of the Great French Revolution. This choice is explained by the fact that turning to its history was an important part of their views and active journalistic activity, but at the same time, the experience of understanding the revolutionary events in France by representatives of the conservative camp of the second half of the 19th - early 20th centuries has not been sufficiently studied in historiography.
   The sources of the article were the works of conservative publicists of the era of "Great Reforms" and the representatives of the conservative part of the social and political movement of the early XX century. Among the first are the works of V.I. Gerrier, E.M. Feoktistov and N.A. Lyubimov; among the second - the works of T.I. Butkevich, holy righteous Ioann Kronstadtski and N.D. Zhevakhov. The authors were selected for their publications, in which they devoted considerable attention to the analysis and evaluation of the events of the French Revolution.
   The article discusses in detail the main problems related to the history of the Great French Revolution that the conservative leaders of the second half of the 19th - early 20th centuries were concerned about. The article considers what was particularly important for them in connection with this event, and analyses the conclusions they reached. In the process of research, the authors came to the conclusion that for all of them, one way or another, the appeal to the history of the revolution in France was only practical. First of all, they were interested in the experience of the Great French Revolution. What is more, they were treated mostly extremely negative about this experience in relation to Russian reality of that period. They tried in every way to prevent its implementation.
   However, in the presence of common points, there are important differences in the works of conservatives from different periods of Russian history. The conservative leaders of the Alexander II era were firstly interested in the political aspect of the history of the French Revolution, so they focused on the issues of power and, making their generalizations, tried to warn against the reiteration of such scenarios of political development in Russian reality. In turn, the conservative publicists of the early 20th century, mainly of the "chernosotentsy", in addition to political issues, paid great attention to the issues of a religious part. For many of them, the revolution was associated with eschatological sentiments that made it not only a socio-political evil for them, but also a crime against God and his covenants. The authors consider the main difference between Russian conservatives of the early 20th century and conservatives of the middle and second half of the 19th century in their understanding of the history of the French Revolution.

AB The article deals with the specifics of the coverage of the historical and local history topic in online publications using the materials of Tomskiy Obzor as an example. The thematic diversity of materials, historical periods covered, genre picture, work with information sources are analyzed. The media are one of the main channels for broadcasting historical knowledge to a mass audience. Historical materials on the federal agenda often take on a journalistic tinge and serve to express a position within the framework of socio-political speeches. In the regions, local history materials are also gaining more and more popularity - many online publications start special sections, and publications covering the historical past often become the most read. The aim of this study is to identify the specifics of the coverage of historical and local history topics in online publications. The material for the study is 178 local history texts of Tomskiy Obzor published in 2018-2020. The work uses methods of genre research, genre analysis, and content analysis. The study concludes that in 2018-2020 Tomskiy Obzor's local history materials focused mainly on pre-revolutionary history. Despite the prevalence of a neutral position in relation to historical events, the materials created a certain stable and contradictory image of the historical past. The materials of the publication covered both the tourist side of history, characteristic of the media, with architecture, industrial development, enterprises, patrons and merchants, and the secret life of the city, showing robberies, everyday life with pubs, prostitution, and domestic violence. Another conclusion is that local history materials are often full-fledged historical studies with many welldeveloped historical sources, which ensures their exclusivity. It is through the study of a large number of documentary sources that the functions of local history materials are formed: most of the texts are aimed at the audience's cognitive interest. Despite the prevalence of information journalism genres, a large number of photojournalism genres appear in online publications. There are also analytical and literary journalistic materials on historical and local history topics. The key difference between online publications is the emergence of modern multimedia genre forms, in particular longreads, which are characterized by a deep study of the covered topic, as well as experimental formats.

DE Kalmyk steppe; legal proceedings; Zargo; ulus guardian; law enforcement

AB The article aims to study the stages of the trial in the Kalmyk steppe in the second half of the 19th century and to identify special law enforcement practices. The study is based on the analysis of the imperial legislation and documentary materials from the funds of the National Archive of the Republic of Kalmykia. The legal norms of Section II, On Judicial Proceedings in Ulus Zargo, of the Provisions on the Administration of the Kalmyk People (1847) can be grouped according to the thematic principle: the purpose and sources of legal proceedings in the ulus courts; participants in the trial; punishment; execution of punishment. Unfortunately, the legislator in this normative act did not consider in detail the procedure of the proceedings, which determined the relevance of the article. The study is based on the principles of scientificity and objectivity. The research methods were: reconstructive, which restored the stages of judicial proceedings; comparative historical, which revealed the general patterns and features in the functioning of judicial proceedings in the Kalmyk steppe; and historical genetic, which established the cause-andeffect relationship in the judicial proceedings' development. In the course of the study, the authors emphasize the analysis of the case management practice of the ulus directorates in the field of judicial proceedings, thus highlighting their three main stages in the Kalmyk steppe in the specified period. The first stage is the preliminary investigation; the second is the trial itself; the third is the execution of the verdict. The authors note that the Provisions of 1847, for the first time in the imperial legislative practice on regulating the vital activity of the Kalmyk people, took into account the level of their well-being in the punishment. The authors conclude that the legal proceedings in the Kalmyk steppe during the analysed period were characterised by the following features: (1) the incompetence of judges, who had a low level of education, not to mention legal literacy, was typical for this period; (2) the judicial system was not independent from the administrative power, because ulus guardians and their assistants played an essential role in the work of ulus Zargo, and since 1892 they started managing the courts; (3) despite the fact that, after the judicial reforms of Alexander II, openness, adversariality, equality of the parties were declared as the basic principles of justice, the ulus Zargo did not implement these principles, since these reforms did not apply to foreign societies of the Russian Empire.

TI Comparative historical analysis in the prediction of revolutions
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE revolutions; theory of revolution; forecasting of revolutions; basic
   revolutions; correcting revolutions; contemporary revolutions
AB The article considers the problem of forecasting revolutions - one of the main issues raised in social sciences whose solution meets objective and subjective difficulties. Researchers radically diverge in the possibility of predicting revolutions, as well as in the question of whether revolutions have a future or the era of revolutions has passed. An opportunity to predict revolution is important, but most often in forecasts this socio-political phenomenon is substituted for attempts of predicting explosions of social protest in its mass and radical forms which can lead to a change of power. The analysis of revolutions allows, with a huge share of probability, concluding that revolutions have a chance to occur where they never occurred, except for specific cases when certain countries already avoided revolutions. To reach the aim, the author offers a combination of two approaches: (1) a comparative-historical analysis of revolutions as a socio-political phenomenon of the modern era and (2) a method of analogies - if a phenomenon occurs under certain conditions in one country or group of the countries, then this phenomenon, most likely, will also happen in other countries with similar conditions. To solve the problem, the author considers exclusively demonstrations of the phenomenon of revolutions for the period of modern and contemporary history, since forecasting is based on methods of comparative historical analysis and analogies and the article does not set historical and philosophical problems about the possibility in the future of revolutionary phenomena similar to those that took place in antiquity, or to communist revolutions. In the author's opinion, the revolution as a process consists of three components: (1) social protest in mass and radical forms; (2) coup d'etat (change of political power); (3) reforms in the state (significant changes in the system). In the absence of one of the components, the term "revolution" is not applicable. Violation of this rule leads to the blurring of the boundaries of the phenomenon and the dragging into it of other political and socio-political phenomena (coups, reforms, mass protests, etc.). A comparative analysis of more than sixty revolutions identifies two types by external characteristics (algorithm and consequences): basic and corrective (including six models of the revolution algorithm, three in each form). Then the author analyzes options for a norevolution path for various states. This approach allowed the following conclusions. (1) For the majority of the countries, the era of revolutions has come to an end. (2) A large number of the countries of Africa and some countries of Asia have a forthcoming long civilization period before conditions for the revolutions of the modern era mature. (3) In the short and medium terms, a number of countries have prospects of revolutions. At the same time, in connection with globalization and internationalization of the ideas and technologies, these countries can undergo necessary transitions in the evolutionary way through reforms, avoiding revolutionary explosions.

AB The objective of the research is to determine the features of educational cooperation between Russia and Laos with a focus on the period since 2010, when the intensification of bilateral political, military and economic ties between Moscow and Vientiane within the framework of a bilateral "strategic partnership" occurred. While preparing the paper, the authors used bilateral agreements concluded between Russia and Laos, materials from official websites of state bodies and universities, publications of Russian ambassadors in Laos, statistical data from the Russian Ministry of Science and Higher Education, and materials from news agencies. The paper discusses the legal basis for cooperation, as well as the factors and dynamics of the allocation of scholarships by Rossotrudnichestvo for Lao citizens; analyzes the open statistics of the Russian Ministry of Science and Higher Education regarding the education of students from Laos; cites the cases of interuniversity cooperation between Russia and Laos.
   The research reached the following conclusions. The legal basis of Russian-Lao relations in the field of education are the 1994 agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation and the protocol on the equivalence of documents on education and academic degrees, signed by the USSR and Laos in 1978. Due to lack of demand in the 2000s the Rossotrudnichestvo's quota for Laos was the minimum. Since 2010, against the background of the deepening of bilateral ties and the growth of the study of the Russian language in Laos, the number of Rossotrudnichestvo scholarships for citizens of Laos has gradually increased, from 15 to 93 for 2022.
   The statistics of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science based on the reports of universities "VPO-1" shows that, firstly, the vast majority of Lao citizens study at the expense of the Rossotrudnichestvo scholarships. Secondly, a significant increase in the enrollment of students from Laos to Russian universities has been taking place since 2015. Thirdly, in Tomsk, mainly due to admission to Tomsk State University, the largest student diaspora of Laotians in Russia has formed. Fourth, despite the covid pandemic, in 2020 enrollment remained at the same level, but dropped noticeably in 2021. Fifth, there is the problem of successful completion of studies by the students from Laos. For example, in 2017 47 citizens of Laos received Rossotrudnichestvo scholarships for undergraduate programs of Russian universities, and in 2021 only 25 students graduated. The students from Laos require additional support from Russian universities. The most active in interuniversity cooperation between Russia and Laos are regional universities from Vladivostok, Tomsk, Kaluga.

AB Similar to the Russian historical avant-garde of the 1910s, which predicted the war and the social revolution of 1917, the late avant-garde of the 1920s anticipated the advent of the totalitarian terror and the Stalinist repressions of the 1930s. In figurative painting, this manifested itself in a specific visual "lexicon" and modality (bodily violence and the fragmented body, frustration, motifs of loss, death and general catastrophe), as well as in the expressive style (that inherited but not duplicated the models of European expressionism). In addition to proposing an analytical classification of semantics and poetics of the painting of the 1920s, the present article discusses the issue of the representation of political power in visual art and the presence of archaic roots in the corpus patiens (lat.) motifs. It examines artefacts made by eminent as well as little-known painters of the late avant-garde, including Kazimir Malevich, Alexander Tyshler, Kliment Redko, Georgy Rublev, Aleksandr Drevin, Boris Golopolosov and others.

TI Dynastic Sacredness: Islam and the Arab Spring in Morocco
SO MIDDLE EAST POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB The ruling dynasty of Morocco is one of very few that tracks its royal bloodline back to the Prophet Muhammad himself. Did this lineage contribute to the fact that the North African monarchy was barely touched by the tumultuous Arab Spring of 2011-12? This article challenges such assertions. Despite its divine inception, Moroccan royal power survived the era of modernity solely thanks to the French, who invested in their colony during the protectorate (1912-56). It was France that elevated the royals and allowed for the throne to become the pillar of Moroccan nationalism. This venerable lineage would have been futile had the royal family not learned the sophisticated methods of political struggle against its competitors. The dynasty established a unique system of holding the opposition back in such a way that it simultaneously becomes a bulwark of the state's stability. In addition, the bureaucratization of Islam became a key tool in the Moroccan state-building arsenal: Religious practice can be conducted only in accordance with the government rulebook. In other words, Morocco's present-day stability has nothing to do with religion itself, but rather with politics-and the last North African monarchy might still see an Arab Spring awakening.

TI On the Problem of Developing a Theory of Russian Bureaucracy

DT Article
DE Soviet bureaucracy; approaches to studying it; methods of reproduction
   in contemporary Russia
AB This article raises the issue of using Russia's transformations over the last three hundred years as material for creating a theory of bureaucracy that differs from Max Weber's understanding of it. This issue is addressed using the understandings developed at the Rostov School of Political Sciences of the Southern Federal University (Russia), which is working out a conceptual apparatus for studying the Russian, Soviet, and post-Soviet bureaucracy in relation to the process of forming an opposition free from stereotypes of bureaucratic action, behavior, and thought. This kind of opposition could not have arisen in monarchical, Soviet, or post-Soviet Russia. The reasons for this are explained by a theory of bureaucracy that contains a reconstruction of Marx's definition of bureaucracy as a social parasitic organism, a reflection of numerous social contradictions and the embodiment of political alienation. The article discusses the cognitive situation in contemporary Russia, ways for researchers to avoid the choice imposed by post-Soviet authorities, and the specific features of the genesis and structure of the assertion of police society in Russia.

AB The article explores the pan-European tendency for foreign states to turn European Muslim associations, consisting of people from these states, into their agents of influence. This problem is illustrated by the case of the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs (DITIB) association in Germany which a de facto and de jure instrument of Turkish influence. The peculiarity of "DITIB" is that this association is under the constant leadership, control and supervision of the State Bureau of Religious Affairs of Turkey "Diyanet", which was previously associated with the Prime Minister of Turkey, and today reports directly to President R Erdogan. DITIB includes 950 of the 2600 mosques in Germany. The imams of these mosques are Turkish civil servants who are paid by Ankara and are usually posted for five years from Turkey to Germany. The article concludes that DITIB on the one hand is an instrument of influence of Turkey, and, on the other hand, expresses the tendency of the Turkish community in Germany to increase affiliation with Turkey and weaken affiliation with Germany. The shift in affiliation in favor of Turkey occurred primarily among the more religious representatives of the second and third generations. For many years, the German authorities have considered DITIB an important contact point for matters of faith and integration, and the association has benefited from state funding. The importance of internal structures of DITIB for domestic political events in Turkey also became evident after the failed coup attempt in Turkey in the summer of 2016 and the subsequent series of scandals related to espionage in favor of Turkey.

AB The results of an investigation into the process of creating the Russian national state in the second half of the fifteenth century are given. The main directions of eliminating the political fragmentation of the Russian lands in the areas of the treasury, organization of public service, and the court of law are shown. Moscow's fiscal policy is characterized by a desire to rely on Pomorye's tenant communities and reduce the granting of immunities to landowners. The important role of innovations introduced into the land description system after the incorporation of Novgorod is noted. The variety in forms of service relations practiced in the united state made it possible to use in the service both traditionally organized detachments of service princes, small landowning members of the zemstvo, and cohorts of landowners. The institutions of central and local government, for all their imperfections, ensured the collection of taxes and the observance of law and order. The conflict potential of society was mitigated by the practice of filing collective petitions and judicial practices. In conclusion, the conventional ideas formed in the historiography about the type of state in Russia are revised and its characterization as a judicial monarchy is substantiated.

   Red Brigades; mafia; separatism; Islamist terrorism; migration; Italian
   Terrorism Legislation
AB European security today faces new challenges that are not directly related to military force. Among them, first of all, is the threat of terrorism, which has both internal and external dimensions. The article is devoted to the study of the phenomenon of terrorism in the European Union on the example of Italy. The author analyses four types of this threat posed by terrorists according to their political motivation: separatism, left- and right-wing domestic political terrorism, and Islamist terrorism. Italian law distinguishes between the concepts of terrorism, radicalism and subversion. According to the 2015 law, terrorism is defined as conduct that, by its nature or context, may cause serious harm to a country or an international organization. It is aimed at intimidating the population or forcing the State or international organizations to commit or refuse to commit any action. The evolution of the phenomenon of terrorism in Italy is of particular interest because it reflects both general and specific features of the terrorist threat in Europe. From the late 1960s to the 1970s and until the beginning of the 1980s, Italian society had been facing the most brutal manifestations of terrorism. During this period, terrorism evolved from ideological far-right extremism to ultra-left revolutionary extremism, which turns to violence against the State and its servants, calling for a communist transformation of society. By the end of the 1980s, the terrorist threat in Italy had been significantly reduced. The decline in terrorist activity in the 1980s is explained, in addition to the increased effectiveness of the intelligence services and the police, by the decline in political activity in Italy after the upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s. The author draws attention to one of the paradoxes of Islamist terrorism in Italy. Despite the fact that Italy bears the main flow of migration waves that can carry the threat of terrorism to Europe, the country has so far been spared from the large-scale threat of such kind. The example of Italy is also important because today the country's leadership is the most effective in counterterrorism in comparison with other EU states.

AB The article focuses on the unrealized plans of Hetman Pavel Skoropadsky to convene the parliament of the Ukrainian state - the Sejm, which was to be opened in early 1919. The problem is considered in a number of works by Ukrainian researchers (first of all, the article by Ruslan Pyrih), but they are uninformative and contain a number of erroneous statements. The preparation for the elections to the Sejm - the parliament of an independent Ukraine - began in October 1918, but already in November, the political situation changed, and the Sejm began to be understood as a representative body of a subject in the future federative Russian state. In late November and early December 1918, a special commission, consisting mainly of members of the Constitutional Democratic Party, developed an electoral law on elections to the Sejm. The elections were to be held according to the majority system of a relative majority in 251 single-member constituencies. Though women had no right to vote, the age limit was raised and the residence requirement was introduced, the electoral law was generally consistent with similar laws of the leading European states. Since the uprising headed by the Directory began and Hetman abdicated, the elections never took place. Drawing on materials from the Kiev press and archival sources, the author shows the historical roots of the Ukrainian Sejm, the process of developing the electoral law and its final version, as well as the attitude towards the Sejm on the part of various Ukrainian and Russian political forces.

AB The system-dynamic model elaborates processes for recruiting political elites across Russia's regions from 1985 to 2019. The authors consider several counterfactual sce-narios through computational simulations. The first series includes the radical disinte-gration of Soviet recruitment mechanisms. The second series elaborates the opposite scenario: the gradual evolution/preservation of Soviet continuity. The third series simulates a unique situation where Vladimir Putin abandons his policy for strengthen-ing the "vertical of power." A key finding is that the fight against new threats (crime, corruption, separatism) did not allow the center to realize the impact of traditional existing institutions that had corrosive and destructive power.

DT Article
DE political science; international relations; theory of international
   relations; system of international relations; foreign policy; bilateral
   relations; political space
AB The article presents an approach to assessment of how independent an international actor can be from the political point of view. The author formulates a coordinate system composed of four spaces (fields) of social communication. The first one is the space of ideological interaction. In this space, governments have a possibility to manipulate the policies of their counteragents via exploiting psychological sentiments in the short term or fortifying specific worldview attitudes in the long run among the peoples in foreign countries. The second is the space of international norms. Unlike on the national level, the international relations system does not imply an existence of a common decision-making mechanism that serves as a generator of communication norms. Therefore, states use their national might to establish a normative order, which they are trying to fortify by consequently repeating specific actions in the international arena. In the third space, international actors try to integrate their counteragents into a specific type of economic relations that would serve as a determinant of their behavior. Finally, in the security space, the relations of states are defined by their internal understanding of what specific international trends and policies could threaten their own interests of national survival and development. The author concludes that the state of affairs in these four spaces determines the nature of subjectivity (sovereignty) of international actors on the global political stage. Through this lens, their bilateral relations could be classified into one of three types: subject-subject (interdependent), subject-object (unilaterally dependent) or object-object (independent). Therefore, the assessment of the nature of interstate bilateral relations could serve as a good starting point to characterize the whole structure of the international relations system: whether it is functioning in a unipolar, bipolar or multipolar manner. Moreover, the presented methodology could help to evaluate a degree of effectiveness of the foreign policy strategies implementation, since it presents a measurable coordinate system of the state and the structure of international affairs.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE sovereignty; spatial world; globalization; macroregions; post-space
AB Sovereignty issues are a complex set of problems of an interdisciplinary nature. The meaning of the term "sovereignty" has not changed but its content is constantly evolving. The Peace of Westphalia has been a recognized milestone in the understanding of sovereignty. However, at the turn of 2021-2022 we witnessed another milestone in understanding of sovereignty. The triumph of re-sovereignty is obvious both to those who advocate the preservation of the former model of globalization and to those who see its natural collapse. The new approach to sovereignty means not only control over territory, but also over information, and this dimension of sovereignty is becoming particularly important. Sovereignty is a historically concrete phenomenon. The legal norms of the post-war era assumed that States were legally equal, and their political independence was not openly disputed. This approach is outdated. Today, the competition of sovereignties in the world of post-globalization is extremely complex and contradictory since not only economies compete, but also models of sovereignty. The central level of the "competition of sovereignties" is the sovereignty of space versus the sovereignty of supraspace systems. National sovereignty can be implemented only if it is operationally secured. Formal national sovereignty, "default sovereignty", defined in the discourse of classical international law, is unlikely to remain in the political practice of the post-global world, as well as international law perse. Sovereignty should be protected, using a wide range of political, managerial, social and power tools, otherwise it would be fundamentally impossible to provide any form of protection of society and the state.

AB The article focuses on the issues of the Soviet Ukrainian periodicals Pravda Ukrainy (Kyiv) and Rabochaya gazeta (Kyiv), timed to the most popular Soviet public celebrations: New Year, May Day, and October Revolution Day. The author analyses the graphics of about 180 newspapers of 1953-1984 to determine the approaches to selecting visual elements (front page drawings, caricatures, cartoons and other decorative sketches). The chronology of newspaper images and symbols clearly shows the evolution of key political categories, their relevance, diversity, and interrelation, depending on the regional specificity of the newspaper. The visualization scheme naturally differed for each celebration. For example, the May Day or, especially, October Revolution Day newspaper issues invariably published portraits of Vladimir Lenin, while the political symbolism of New Year holiday referred to the Kremlin towers. In different years, the background that formed the plot of holday illustrations was industry or space exploration, international workers' parade or family life. The repetition of compositional and semantic elements not only emphasized their significance, but, in time, began to indicate the lack of new ideas. Meanwhile, the political satire, represented by foreign policy caricatures, gradually gave way to humorous cartoons related to domestic casual topics. The national specificity of visual symbolism could be found only in some types of visual images, as well as in accompanying texts in Ukrainian.

ID MUSCOVY; DESPOTISM; TRUTH
AB Historiography of the study of Ivan the Terrible's times contains many examples of demystification attempts: E. Keenan declared the correspondence between Ivan the Terrible and Andrey Kurbsky to be apocrypha, Anthony Grobovsky exposed the 'Chosen Rada', Mikhail Krom unmasked the time of 'boyar rule'. Cornelia Soldat suggests revising the history of the 'massacre of Novgorod' in 1570. She believes it to be a product of a 'literary game'. The story of the destruction of Novgorod first appeared in the German Flying Leaf in 1570 and Alexander Guagnini's Chronicle in 1578. It was a product of European political discourse. The Novgorod Chronicles borrowed that story from Guagnini's Chronicle in the late 17th century. However, this hypothesis lacks sufficient proof. Independent evidence exists: The Solovetsky Chronicle of the 16th century. According to Soldat, the reports from The Novgorod Uvarov Chronicle date back to the late 16t-early 17th (about 1606) centuries, rather than to the 17th century. The main argument against her concept is the confirmation in independent sources and documents of the death of many people, while the circumstances of the repression or death point to Novgorod and 1570. The Novgorod chronicles contain no evidence of text borrowings from German or Polish sources. There is no proven textual similarity between them. The story of the 'massacre of Novgorod' evolved in the Novgorod's urban legends. This would have been hardly possible, if this story had been of a purely bookish, literary origin. Therefore, Cornelia Soldat's attempt to demystify the history of the 'massacre of Novgorod' in 1570 cannot be considered convincing.

AB China's direct overseas investment policy shows a significant shift from the "going global" strategy to the "One Belt, One Road" initiative. The active promotion of the government and the breakthrough initiative of state-owned enterprises became the hallmark of China's direct investments abroad. The main advantage of direct investments of Chinese companies is the government guidance and service. The Chinese government provides political guidance and certain services to companies that implement their needs for investments abroad, helping them to go out into the outside world and securing their interests abroad. This is where the special advantages of the country come out. This article analyses legal documents, policies and regulations adopted by the Chinese government since 2000 in order to provide the protection for overseas investment of the national state and private enterprises. Only through the combination of the four components of the system, such as the adoption of laws and regulations, the implementation of regulatory policies, the adoption of preventive measures, and the use of crisis response mechanisms, it is possible to ensure the situation when the overseas investment of Chinese companies will continue to grow, and it will be possible to prevent or even avoid the adverse effects of perceived political risks in the country of investment and achieve the goal of ensuring "safe and sustainable" foreign investment. The author formulates political recommendations for the nowadays implementation of the specific advantages of the state in order to fulfill a better protection for the overseas investment interests of Chinese enterprises.

AB The Australian component of UK foreign policy in the context of the changing world order is outlined. It is highlighted that, in a value and ideological sense and due to the common Anglo-Saxon identity, London assigns Canberra a key role in the coalition of like-minded countries ("network of liberty"); in geostrategic terms, it perceives Australia as a platform to expand the UK influence in the Indo-Pacific. At present, the "special" partnership between the two countries is underpinned by a number of new agreements, including a "historical" trade deal aimed at strengthening economic ties and in-depth political, diplomatic, and defense cooperation, based on a new military alliance, AUKUS. At the same time, the traditional pragmatism inherent in the foreign policy of Australia, which positions itself as a reliable international actor, is being replaced by increasing military-political and economic dependence, which plays into the hands of London. Coming closer with Australia also allows Britain to present itself as the key extraregional player in the system of anti-Chinese alliances in the Indo-Pacific, with Washington and Canberra in the forefront.

AB The expansion of foreign correspondent networks in the late Soviet period reflected the importance that international news and reporting had for readers of the Soviet press. This article traces the development of one such foreign correspondent network, that of the Soviet newspaper Sel'skaia zhizn' (Rural Life), one of the most popular and widespread newspapers in the Soviet Union. Although historiographically overlooked in favor of major political newspapers like Pravda (Truth) and Izvestiia (News), Sel'skaia zhizn' was an important source of foreign news for the rural population of the Soviet Union. The article examines the role of the editorial office of Sel'skaia zhizn' in creating a correspondent network, tracing the geographical reach of the newspaper's correspondents (sobkors) and analyzing their activities and different types of publications. While some materials were similar to those published in other Soviet newspapers, the specifically rural audience of Sel'skaia zhizn' influenced the topics chosen for articles as well as the style of the authors. The newspaper became a practical guide for readers because foreign correspondents provided them with unique information about the development of agriculture abroad. The article provides research into how readers perceived international news and information in Sel'skaia zhizn', finding that readers expected the newspaper to fulfill their needs and to reflect their own interests, even in the international section.

AB The problem of missile defense is considered by Russian researchers, first of all, as part of the strategic stability problem in relations between Russia and the United States. At the same time, the impact of regional missile defense (theater missile defense) on regional security remains largely unexplored. The US and NATO leadership continue to claim that Russia has deployed intermediate-range missiles in the European part of the country. As a response to this step, in addition to other measures of regional deterrence towards Russia, it is planned to strengthen NATO's regional missile defense system. The purpose of this article is to determine the potential impact of enhancing NATO's theater missile defense on regional security. The answer to this question is important for understanding the prospects for European security. This article provides a critical analysis of Western experts' scenarios of actions of Russia and NATO around the Baltic countries the place and role of theater missile defense in these scenarios and compares the doctrinal guidelines of the United States and Russia regarding regional nonnuclear deterrence. There are situations in which NATO's enhanced regional missile defense could strengthen regional deterrence, and there are situations where this is less likely. Taking into account the doctrinal guidelines of both sides, conclusions are drawn about the destabilizing potential of NATO's regional missile defense enhancement and that, in strengthening regional stability, there is no alternative to arms control and transparency regimes.

DE Forced migrants; political system; political actor; Siberia; World War I
AB Forced migration during the First World War has become a powerful factor affecting both international relations and the situation within involved countries. In the Russian Empire this phenomenon appeared to be a new factor in the political space. Researchers believe that in the European part, the refugee component of this migration flow has had a noticeable impact on the collapse of state power in provinces. At the same time, there is a common opinion that the deported part of the immigrants, once in the Siberian provinces, joined the composition of organizations and movements dissatisfied with the authorities and, accordingly, contributed to the further shattering of state structures in these regions. The purpose of this article is to analyze the mentioned influence on the materials of the main recipient territory of all types of forced migrants - Siberia. The work is based on the historical-genetic method, the application of which made it possible to reconstruct the features of the interaction of various political actors within the region. The orientation of their political activity, its degree was determined on the basis of the historical-psychological method. As a result of the study, there was formulated the statement about the vector of the impact of forced migrants on the political forces of Siberian society, from the perspective of the actor-network theory of Bruno Latour, John Law and Michel Callon. This methodological approach refuted the classical historiographic position that there was no political influence on the part of the group of forced migrants, with the exception of the active position of the deported ones. Also, during the analysis, it was confirmed that the left political powers were not interested in migrants.

DT Article
DE Islamic vector; politics; Russia; Organization of Islamic Cooperation;
   extremism
AB The Islamic vector is a part of Russian foreign policies. Its importance should not be exaggerated, yet it may hardly be ignored. This vector is underpinned by Russia's striving to establish close relations with the Muslim world and to emphasize the closeness of their interests, as well as to contain the Western domination in the global politics by means of cultivating and promoting common contribution of Russia and Muslim countries to the creation of a new world order based on the principle of multipolarity. The Russian official ideology emphasizes the similarity of traditions and civilizational identities of Russia and the Islamic Ummah. In 2015, Russian president Vladimir Putin said that Russia is a Muslim country. Undoubtedly, it may be considered a propagandist declaration, however it was highly appreciated in the Muslim world. This idea of closeness of Russia and the Islamic Ummah is supported by the Russian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow has stressed that the Russian Orthodoxy is more similar to the Islamic tradition than to the Western Christianity. Nonetheless, it is impossible to establish close relations with the Muslim world as different interests of dozens of Muslim countries have to be taken into consideration. Consequently, the Islamic vector in the foreign policy of Russia plays an instrumental role and is deeply linked to its pragmatic - political and economic - goals. The Ukrainian crisis and the deterioration of the Russian-Western relations stimulate Russia's increased interest in deepening relations with Muslim countries. Yet, there are several obstacles on this path. The first consists in Russia's inability to provide the much needed economic and financial assistance to Muslim countries on a regular basis and in the required amounts. Russia cannot compete with the Western economies, with which Muslim countries have established long-term relations. Another problem is the pressure that the West, and first and foremost the United States, exerts on the Muslim states in an attempt to make them join the anti-Russian sanctions. In some cases, these attempts may be fruitful, in others - they fail, but they continue, leaving a negative impact on the Russian relations with the Muslim world.

AB This article is devoted to the study of the influence of government data performance on knowledge capabilities. Knowledge capabilities play a key role in open innovation and creation of citizen-oriented products and services. However, it is necessary to assess the role of the information environment in the development of knowledge capabilities, including government data as a product and a component of the information environment. Government data performance is expressed through the statistical capacity score and its three dimensions: periodicity assessment of statistical capacity, methodology assessment of statistical capacity, and source data assessment of statistical capacity. Knowledge capabilities are expressed through economic complexity, which reflects the diversity and uniqueness of the production capabilities inherent in each country's exports. Econometric analysis is based on dynamic panel data models that quantify the effect of government data performance on economic complexity. The final dataset includes 94 countries and their indicators for the selected variables for 2004-2019. The models show that government data performance and its various dimensions influence economic complexity because government data provide a detailed and publicly available description of the economic space, including available resources and potential tasks. Based on these data, agents can produce dissimilar and unique products. This logic may be true in general for the influence of government data performance on knowledge capabilities: structured and complete government data reduces the cost of information analysis and provides information support for decisions. The results of the study contribute to the ideas of a data-oriented political economy. Government participation in value creation includes various forms of indirect influence. The provision of government data is one of these forms. The development of collective data governance and collaborative data projects makes it possible to create more complete datasets and stimulates citizen involvement and deliberation.

AB The transition to nomadic animal husbandry, associated with the development of horse riding, began in Eurasia in the 1st millennium B.C. This led not only to economic, cultural and socio-political ties between the nomads of Eurasia and the peoples of the Ancient East, Eastern Mediterranean, Near and Middle Asia, but also to the need to protect cattle as "easily alienated wealth" (F. Engels). As a result, a complex technology of nomadic economy was developed, the value of which was represented by the art of the "animal style" - a special sign system expressing the ideology of the nomads. The sign system is most fully preserved in the barrows of the Pazyryk culture: the "royal" barrows of Tuekta, Bashadar and Pazyryk, the elite barrows of the Ukok and the barrows of ordinary nomads of Sailugem, Ulandryk and Yustyd. Since the funerary ritual on a symbolic level ensures subsequent rebirth, it is relevant to investigate the archaeological sources of the Altai Mountains as a text embodying socially significant information. The ensemble of signifying means located on the surface of the artefacts, connected with the whole sphere of nomadic activity, is represented by such concepts as "mound", "sarcophagus deck", "weapon", "costume", "body tattoo", "horse harness". In accordance with the accumulated experience of social interaction in the axiosphere of the Pazyryk culture two basic semantic systems were formed: "life" and "death", on the basis of which a man understood the possibilities of his activity in the system of nomadic society. The theme of life and death emerged from observations of natural and climatic conditions, where destruction, extinction is a benign state after which the cycle of life is renewed. In the course of semiotic analysis of the system of status marking of a rider, his weapons and horse, referred to as the Scythian "animal style", a relationship with the key concept in all Indo-European and Indo-Iranian ritualism "farn" was determined. This notion symbolises military fortune, share, destiny and is the value-motivational core of the Pazyryk culture.

AB A seventeenth-century tradition of British political arithmetic merged the empiricism of Sir Francis Bacon with an early version of statisti-cal science. William Petty, John Graunt, and Gregory King were leaders in this work. They used no higher mathematics but only what English-speaking people called shop arithmetic, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They debated how far statistical data should inform the decisions of statesmen, and that debate prepared the British political elite for their acceptance of state financial reform under King William III. We now draw your attention to the parallel suppression of the same tradition of early statistical science in seven-teenth-century France. Using shop arithmetic, Marshal Vauban pro-posed a reform of taxation, but King Louis XIV rejected the proposal. Not only that. The king dismissed Vauban from all his offices, and the king suppressed Vauban's book, The Royal Tenth, thus preventing any wide discussion of Vauban's suggestions. As a result, no one ever pre-pared the French public to understand simple statistical data or to accept financial reforms under the old regime. When John Law tried to implement other reforms during the regency which followed King Louis XIV's death, the reforms failed because of this absence of public understanding.

AB The problem of reducing corruption in the system of public service in the regional management structures in situations of citizens' appeals to the authorities of any level, when the employees have the desire to solve public issues, through the adoption of regulations. Under these conditions, increasing public control of public servants is becoming increasingly important, which affects the factor of moral control of officials through various channels of communication in society. The subject of the study is the opinion of the residents of the Kemerovo region (Russia) in their attitude to corruption in the government. The aim of the study is to prepare recommendations for reducing the level of corruption in the system of regional public service. The study uses two ways of knowledge - comparative and institutional, as well as empirical methods - the method of sampling, the method of observation, the method of questionnaire survey. The article analyzes the conclusions obtained by studying the problems of corruption in other regions, primarily in Moscow and the Novosibirsk region, where civil servants assess manifestations of corruption in public service in their regions. With the increasing openness of the authorities, the decisions of the top leadership of the country and regions are aimed at increasing the prestige of the public servant, which is becoming an increasingly important aspect of public control. Thus, the successes achieved in the formation of the prestige of the public servant, largely due to the reaction of the population to the practice of administrative activity of the public servant. This article analyzes the activities of the top leadership of the Kemerovo region to prevent corruption in the civil service.

DT Article
DE Revolution of 1917; Civil War; state formations
AB The article analyzes the collapsing of the Russian Empire and the formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The process is presented as a chronicle of the creation and liquidation of state formations from 28 February 1917 to 30 December 1922 on the territory of the country, including Poland, Finland and the territories of Turkey and Austria, where Russian troops were stationed. The chronicle records the formation of 150 different authorities that claimed to be all-Russian or regional power, organized by Russian political forces or interventionist troops. The chronicle is based on information from encyclopedias and reference books. Statistics on the creation of organizations show that state construction was most intensive in 1917 (24 new formations were created), 1918 (60), and 1918 (22). During this three-year period, Anti-Bolshevik forces were more active than others and formed 50 governments, interventionists formed 17 governments, the Soviet authorities established 31 states. Some governments claimed the all-Russian status - the Omsk government of Alexander Kolchak, the Special Meeting of Anton Denikin, the Government of the South of Russia of Pyotr Wrangel. The governments of the RSFSR, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Finland, Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Khiva and Bukhara had nationwide claims. Most of the governments were regional and opportunistic, formed by local political and military circles, which were supported by the Whites, the Reds, or the interventionists. In 1920-1922, anti-Soviet forces were able to organize 4 governments, the interventionists 1, the construction of Soviet state structures was confidently underway = 32 states of different levels and 3 democratic state structures were created in the Far East under the control of the Bolsheviks. The result of state construction on 30 December 1922 recorded 7 sovereign states (USSR, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Tannu-Tuva People's Republic) and two governments without territory - the Belarusian People's Republic and the Karelian United government in Vyborg. The Soviet Union was a unique, extremely complex state entity: it included 4 union republics - the RSFSR, the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, the Ukrainian SSR, the Belarusian SSR. The Transcaucasian SFSR consisted of the Azerbaijani SSR, the Armenian SSR and the union of the Georgian SSR and the Abkhaz SSR. In addition, formally, the Soviet Union did not include two People's Soviet republics - Bukhara and Khorezm, with which the RSFSR had union treaties. The USSR included 2 labor communes, 8 autonomous republics and 12 autonomous regions. The basis of Soviet state-building was the principle of national self-determination. The Soviet experience of assembling a single state is now in demand again due to the growth of nationalism on the territory of the former USSR and the desire of Russia's geopolitical opponents to use it to destroy the country and seize its resources.

AB A backlash against liberal gender and sexuality attitudes has been an issue in many societies, especially post-Communist. However, it takes a different shape in each socio-cultural context. This article contributes to academic debates about neo-traditionalism in the post-Soviet space and focuses specifically on Armenia. It points at some possible mechanisms that make these societies look more neo-traditionalist than they actually are. From the previous research of gender aspects of nationalism, we argue that the neo-traditionalist public discourses in Armenia might be a by-product of the national identity construction. We conclude that the individual-choice attitudes in the post-Soviet space may reflect the respondents' acceptance of a national ideology promoted by the post-Soviet elites rather than their private practices. Our aim is to reveal the complexities of neo-traditionalism in the post-Soviet space where everyday practices are at odds with neo-traditionalist narratives, which we argue might be a result of the Soviet legacy of unwritten rules and open secrets.

The purpose of the study is to reconstruct the discursive space around the figure of Peter I and to conduct the classification analysis of the scientific and historical-journalistic approaches put forward in relation to it. When conducting the research, the authors relied on the combination of the theory of discourse and traditional methods of historiography. Based on the study of modern scientific and journalistic literature, there were described 8 historiographical models of understanding the activities of Peter I in relation to various methodologies of history. On the basis of the results obtained, the authors conclude that there has begun a new historiographical stage in the study of Peter the Great's time manifested in the change in the key dichotomies of the public discussion on Peter I. The forecast is made about the shift in the approaches to perceiving Peter I established in society under the influence of historiographical discourse and current political transformations.

DE heritage; archaeological monument; social interpretation; public
   discourse
AB This article considers the phenomenon of archaeological heritage as a multi-linear cultural process that correlates with various cultural meanings and values. The relevance of this research is connected with the western heritage canon rooted in the scientific community which considers all kinds of heritage (including archaeological one) as a material expression of a national-political idea. However, some cases demonstrate completely different forms and roles of heritage (religious, creative, educational) where the national-political factor sometimes plays a secondary or even insignificant role. So we can suggest that formation of images of the past is determined by the social agency of people, but the institutional influence of power. The purpose of the article is to present certain archaeological images in public discourse, from the standpoint of social actions, individual and group values, language and ways of discussion and social factors which make heritage demanded.
   The article's author develops an approach in considering such key definition as heritage analyzing the key works in the field of Heritage Studies and Critical Heritage Studies. At the end of this section the author considers all symbols and values connected with heritage as a part of the public (social) discourse. Public discourse suggests that heritage is not a fabricated image of the past, it focuses on the connection with the present, it can be changed, clarified and concretized depending on private and public norms, values and identities
   In the next section the concept of archaeological heritage is concretized by considering the specific material features of archaeological monument which distinguish them as a separate type of heritage. We can note scientifically proven pastness, clarity, fragmentation and ambiguity of archaeological monuments. In the author's opinion these features form a variety of contexts and options for reading an archaeological monument and set a special stimulus for interpretations of the material past. Thus the multi-contextuality of archaeological monument forms a multitude of "heirs" and a variety of forms of dealing with the past.
   The social and cultural cases noted in the paper ("Altai Princess", the phenomenon of Arkaim, the Prussian ports in Koenigsberg as a place of national memory, etc.) show different values and meanings that are not limited by the framework of official scientific and political statements. It is concluded that heritage is not a completed socio-political product, but an unceasing multi-linear process. Every social act in relation to heritage (creation, perception, perpetuation, narrating and even inaction) leaves a discursive consequence. Thus the interpretation of the archaeological past is an anthropological problem that needs to be studied with a wide range of qualitative methods (participant observation, biographical interviewing, discourse analysis, etc.).

DT Article
DE political science; international relations theory; foreign policy;
   ideology; political space; ideologeme; identity
AB The article presents a theoretical model of how ideological concepts may impact the foreign political strategies of states. The author thinks that the necessity to build a more concrete understanding of the strategic goal setting process is more relevant these days due to the increasing ochlocratic influence on the governmental behavior in the international arena. The model is based on three logically intertwined pillars. The first of them analyzes the socio-psychological mechanism of the transformation of ideas into specific actions on the part of an individual or a collective body. Special attention is paid to the phenomenon of ideologemes as compact expressions of normative attitude towards the surrounding events. The article also takes into consideration psychological predispositions that made the conversion of some ideas into actions more probable. The second pillar accounts for the decision-making process. It analyses the most significant elements of the mechanism, that determine how long-term national interests and specific goals are formulated within the political establishment, the expert and governmental officials' community. The author also presents a vision in which an overall national might, presence or absence of political will define the spectrum of potentially made decisions. This approach can give a more detailed and concrete understanding of the nature of subjectivity in world affairs. The third pillar is based on the analysis of how a governmental actor perceives through its ideological lens its own interaction with the surrounding international environment. This pillar considers the actors' self-positioning in the world, the foreign policy instruments this actor uses to affect external objects in order to fortify its place on the global stage. The model may be useful for research of the long-term foreign policy strategic planning, establishing specific criteria of effectiveness of its implementation, and forecasting the decision-making process.

   political pamphlet
AB The article presents an analysis of the historical, political and philosophical work of outstanding German scientist, Professor Gottlieb Samuel Treuer "Apology of Ivan Vasilyevich II, Grand Duke of Moscow, usually falsely accused of tyranny," published in Vienna in 1711. It was found that this work was one of the first papers, one way or another devoted to Russian history, published in the West in the Petrine era. During the Great Northern War the tendency to compare the reign of Ivan the Terrible and Peter I was quite clear, due to the fact that the "Baltic issue" remained valid for Russia more than a century after the failures in the Livonian War. The Russian propaganda in Europe needed to present Ivan the Terrible as a great ruler, without excessive cruelty and tyranny. The analysis conducted by the author showed that Treuer brilliantly coped with the task. In his work he proved that all the actions of Ivan the Terrible were justified by the public necessity and the morals of the Russian people. The "Apology of Ivan Vasilyevich" also contributed to the fact that some representatives of German scientific thought got carried away by Russian history. Among them were, in particular, G.F. Miller and A.L. Schlozer.

DE Anthropocene; climate change; environmental crisis
AB The publication is dedicated to the recently published Russian translation of the book The Age of Man: Rhetoric and Apathy of the Anthropocene by Ewa Binczyk, professor of philosophy at Nicolaus Copernicus University (Torun, Poland). The review summarizes the main themes of the work, highlights its strengths and weaknesses, and concludes by considering the role historians and their theoretical developments should play in the discussions about the Anthropocene. The review criticizes the absence of a sharply formulated thesis and a clear line of the author's argument in the text. The ideas formulated by Ewa Binczyk can hardly be called new; they rather generalize what has already been argued by other researchers in the framework of the discussion of the past decade and a half. The strengths of The Age of Man include the encyclopedic nature of the book by Ewa Binczyk. She meticulously traces the diverse discussions related to the issues of the Anthropocene and reconstructs the positions taken by the participants in these debates. Among them, Ewa Binczyk distinguishes the discourses of naturalism and post-naturalism, eco-Marxism and eco-modernism, the approaches of supporters and opponents of geoengineering, as well as the discourse of ecological catastrophe. The review also outlines what role the methods of historical science and historical knowledge in general should play in the discussions about the Anthropocene. Ewa Binczyk convincingly argues that it is the great role of the natural sciences with their exact methods that gives weight and authority to the discussions about the Anthropocene. Despite this, geologists, climatologists, physicists, and others are often stumped when it comes to the political, social, and ideological implications of their research. This problem is especially acute in the discussions about the chronology of the Anthropocene era. Various researchers attribute its beginning to the early Pleistocene, the Neolithic Revolution, the Age of Discovery, the Industrial Revolution, or the middle of the 20th century, which marked the beginning of the so-called "Great Acceleration". Each argument has an evidence base, and the adoption of each of them as the official chronology of the Anthropocene can have dangerous political consequences for the world community. Because of this, the scientific community hesitates to make a decision. It seems that Braudel's concept of the multi-layered historical time can become a theoretical basis for a way out of this impasse. It will allow us to talk about multiple chronologies of the Anthropocene, highlight the longue duree, the level of the long duration of this era, as well as the event level. This dialectical approach will make it possible to depart from the simplified mechanistic idea of the periodization of the "age of man".

DE memoirs; historiographical source; professional community
AB The publication analyzes two memoirs and autobiographical works of famous Tomsk historians who belong to the post-war generation. We can consider them as a manifestation of the "memoir burst", the turn towards studying "everyday life" of scholars. The nature of autobiographism in the texts under consideration is defined as much by the course of individual life as by general historical context, by memoirists' generation and professional identity. They contain a combination of the actual memoirs with the use of professional tools, scientific and analytical approach to the reflection of reality, - which is common for memoirs created by historians. The authors identified and collected historical sources, including archival ones, analyzed and summarized the collected materials. The books present not only his own life (from rural childhood and student youth to joining the professorial corporation), but also the history of his family and clan, his social stratum. The memoirists come from the Siberian peasantry, their older relatives experienced dekulakization and exile. The texts contain open and vivid political assessments. The memoirs of historians combine the features of historiographical source and literary artifact; they contain valuable information on the corporate ethos of the professional community. They cover such important subjects as the influence of scientific supervisors on the formation of a scientist, how the process of translating the principles of research activity was carried out, how the formation and development of a scientific school took place. The autobiography of V.P. Boyko highlights such stages of professional career as the choice of the topic of scientific research, change of jobs, scientific discussions, ideological and political disputes. The photographs attached to his book complement the text and become an independent visual source.
   Peer-reviewed books are useful and even necessary for reconstructing the process of the formation of a well-known scientific school, identifying and studying the circumstances that influenced this process, the role of individual actors. Comparison of the memoirs under consideration with similar works created by representatives of the older generation and/or the metropolitan segment of the community will allow analyzing regional and generational specifics. They are of great importance as historiographical sources and as a means of preserving the identity of the professional community.

AB The article is devoted to the Russian army in the twentieth century and the participation of the Bashkir component in it. It analyze the materials of the famous public and political figure Karim Idelguzhin, extracted from the collections of tow archives and National library of the Republic of Bashkortostan, transliterated from Arabic and translated from Bashkir into Russian. His works are a vivid indicator of social and political thought of the Bashkir national movement leaders, who did not emigrate after the Civil war, but devoted themselves to serving the Motherland here. Idelguzhin Karim Abdullovich (1895-1937), was taught in known throughout the Asian part of Russia madrasah "Galiya", served in the Russian army and participated in the First world war, then as a non-commissioned officer and scrivener in the Bashkir cavalry regiment, member of the republican newspapers, Bashkir revolutionary committee's commissioner, military Commissioner of the cantons, the People's Commissar of education of the Bashkir ASSR, Deputy Director of the pedagogical Institute. Most of his works remained unpublished, preserved in manuscript form, interesting to a wide audience as a source of additional information about one of the most difficult periods in the history of our state. Three of them - "Remembrance - Participation of Bashkirs on Aktobe front (1919)" - 12 pages of Arabic script, written in 1929; "Remembrance of formation of Bashkir units of the Red Army. 1919" - (in bash.) 23 pages of Arabic script; "Organization of Bashkir autonomy and transition to the Soviets side" (in bash.) - are devoted to a specific topic. They have great accuracy in the information presented and the description of the events described, are not subject to political conjuncture, are not cleaned out by literary editors, are not touched by censorship. Despite some progress on the issue of the problem in the Central and regional historiography, but none of them were devoted to or reviewed by K. A. Idelguzhin. The authors believe that this is due to the inaccessibility of materials to a wide audience of researchers, as well as their safety in Arabica.
   Comparative and contrastive analysis of K. A. Idelguzhin's article showed that he admitted a number of inaccuracies in facts. It does not deviate from then established and now accepted by the majority of authors interpretation of them as direct links in the chain of Bashkir's movement to autonomy. At the same time, the decision to move, like all other sociopolitical movements of Bashkirs, was not the intention of the leaders, and was based on the opinion of the population, and in this case - the Bashkir army. K. Idelguzhin draws the attention to the fact that initially the transience of events and sharp changeability of reality is not given even the opportunity to the Bashkirs to realize them, then - as the leaders of the movement and the population supported them, have become wary, their actions become thoughtful, but always purposeful.

AB The article explores the prerequisites for the formation of a common space of scientific and technical information as an integral part of the common space of scientific, technological and innovative integration within the framework of the EAEU. The article aims to analyze the nature and structure of the existing legal framework for the integration of the EAEU member states in the field of scientific and technical information, as well as to develop proposals for its comprehensive development. The article analyzes the political and legal provisions of a strategic nature, which set out the main areas of cooperation in the exchange of scientific and technical information within the framework of the EAEU. The author substantiates the idea that the formation of a common space of scientific and technical information should take place in line with the implementation of the EAEU Digital Agenda and may well form the content of a targeted interstate project or program related to the thematic area of digital transformations. A scientific and practical provision is being developed that the objective strengthening of the information factor of regional scientific and technological integration is the basis for the formation of a coordinated scientific and information policy of the EAEU member states. As a result of the study, conclusions are drawn that have not only theoretical, but also practical significance. First, the increasing importance of the information factor of regional scientific and technological integration within the EAEU creates an objective basis for the formation and implementation of a coordinated scientific and information policy of its member states, as well as the harmonization of national legislations. In this regard, the need to develop the international contractual framework of the Union in the field of scientific and technical information is being updated in the form of not only including additional provisions in the Treaty on the EAEU or adopting an additional protocol to it, but also concluding a special international agreement that is part of the law of the Union. Second, the development of the contractual framework should be supplemented by the provisions of special acts of the Union's bodies specifying the contractual provisions and relating to the functioning of the regional system of scientific and technical information, as well as the interaction of its participants. Third, conceptual, program, strategic, and advisory documents should be created that specify the guidelines for the development and implementation of practical actions and measures, and set the goals of the legal regulation of interaction between the member states in the functioning of the common space of scientific and technical information.

ID STRUCTURAL REALISM
AB Alexander Bogdanov's tektology and empiriomonism are treated in this article as an applicable basis for the recovery of structural realism in the study of international politics. Kenneth Waltz, the author of the existent structural realist theory, favored a systemic approach to international relations and acknowledged the problem of "organized complexity", as produced by the activities of free-willed individuals, facing social sciences in particular. Yet, unlike Bogdanov, he seems not to have fully appreciated the reverberations that the advent of quantum physics caused for ideas on human cognition. Previously unambiguous distinction between mental and physical manifestations became blurred. It led to the emergence of a general "quantum" methodological school of structural realism, of which Bogdanov is recognized in this article as an early representative. Tektology is a system science, meant by the author to explore organizational features and principles of organization, inherent to any system complexes (biological, political or psychic). At the same time, as pointed out in this research, Bogdanov paid particular attention to the observer problem in societal studies. Bogdanov (as well as Niklass Luhmann later on), but unlike Kenneth Waltz (or Alexander Wendt), would deem neutral observation of international relations (IR) beyond attainment. It is revealed in particular that the long-term appeal of the Waltz's theory has in fact been sustained by the form of system analysis it involved, based on deductive inference. It carried a promise to allow the IR to generate logically coherent theories about the ways that the international system is organized in. In empiriomonism, a method of "universal substitution" is promoted instead, allowing for new gains in knowledge about the unknown outer (material) reality. A theory of international politics of the latter kind could provide a framework for elaboration of new reasonable hypotheses concerning the international sphere.

AB Essay aims at a critical appraisal of the prominent contemporary French social thinker Emmanuel Todd's writings that explore constituent features of different family types and their psychological "worlds". By delineating economic, educational and family relations as belonging respectively to conscious, subconscious and nonconscious spheres he asserts that different family types produce distinctive sets of values that account for person's nonconscious preference for liberty versus authority, inequality versus equality etc. According to Todd to each type of family corresponds a particular ideology, political regime, religion etc. Thereby French sociologist provides original and rather unexpected insights into many social phenomena namely predisposition to liberalism, social democracy, communism, racism, xenophobia etc. Of a particular value is his elucidation of the anthropological roots of individualistic (American-type or absolute nuclear family) and coordinated (German and Japanese or stem family) capitalisms that sheds a new light on supposedly rather well documented story of the varieties of capitalism. However, in economic matters Todd is not always at his best. By describing homo economicus as a conscious but always acting in a framework of particular nonconscious family values, he somewhat blurs distinction between of conscious and nonconscious. In fact, he seems to have never been precise as to which - individual (personal) or collective (societal) - nonconscious family values modify person's economic performance. As he sharply criticizes Germany for imposing a stem family (austerity) type economic policy on EC, one may deduce that they interact at least at a national level. French thinker's theory critically depends on the thesis of an exceptional longevity of nonconscious family values, seemingly a rather questionable idea however supported by evidence. Even accelerating atomization of societies making family values' influence more subtle does not undermine the validity of this his central thesis. Todd' works are not without flaws but they are highly provocative, original and pathbreaking.

DE Maxim Gorky; History of the Village; Library of the Collective Farmer;
   History of Cities; publishing project; book series
AB Maxim Gorky's unrealized publishing project History of the Village was the last in a series of the writer's ideas, such as the History of the Civil War, the History of Factories and Plants, the History of Cities, etc. The idea of the History of the Village took shape in February 1935, when work was already underway on other projects. Gorky's first ideas related in one way or another to the History of the Village appeared in the early 1930s: the history of agriculture, the history of the peasant. In the 1930s, the idea of writing the history of collective farms and state farms by analogy with the History of Factories and Plants came not only to Gorky: such initiatives came from a variety of sources. At the beginning of 1934, the idea of a peasant project was discussed in the Gorky House. During 1934, the Kolkhoznik magazine was created, and the Biblioteka Kolkhoznika (Library of the Collective Farmer) book series was conceived, which later became part of the History of the Village. Gorky's article "History of the Village", published in the central newspapers at the end of February 1935, should be considered the beginning of the work on the project. It took a month and a half to develop a detailed project plan and structure, and to select key employees. A special feature of the structure of the History of the Village was the combination of two types of book series: actual historical and literary-artistic. In terms of content, there is a connection between the History of the Village and the projects History of the Civil War, History of Factories and Plants, History of Cities. The editorial board of the History of the Village decided to start working on books on the history of the village Platovskaya (the birthplace of S.M. Budyonny), the village Gulyai-pole (the birthplace of N.I. Makhno), the Bessarabian commune named after G.I. Kotovsky. They also decided to start developing the history of 50 to 60 collective and state farms. However, Gorky was much more interested in the history of settlements and villages. He thought of the History of the Village by analogy with his other project, the History of Cities. The idea to create such a series appeared at the end of 1931. Active work on it began in 1933 in the Academia publishing house, which was headed by L.B. Kamenev. Speaking of the History of Cities, Gorky necessarily includes the peasant theme in the course of his thoughts. Gorky selected the same sources to work on projects. The plan of the History of the Village contained an item "history of the city (for the village)". Initially, the History of Cities was called the History of Cities as the History of Russian life". The second part of this title is the semantic core that unites both projects. Gorky understood life broadly - as culture, a complex of everyday life that forms a certain type of a person. We can say that the History of the Village was to continue and supplement the History of Cities project. Moreover, after the murder of S.M. Kirov on December 1, 1934, and the arrest of L.B. Kamenev, accused of involvement in this political crime, trouble was in the air for the Academia publishing house, and the History of Cities was called into question. Gorky's plan was not realized, just like most of the writer's other publishing projects of the 1930s.

TI Early nomads' clan organization and the problem of its identification
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE ancestral organization; Scythians; Sarmatians; genealogical and lateral
   accounts of kinship
AB The aim of the article is to determine the peculiarities of the generic organization of the early nomads - Scythians and Sarmatians. The article examines the data of Herodotus, Lucian, Nicholas of Damascus, Valerius Flaccus, and archaeological information that can shed light on the specifics of the kinship systems of Scythians and Sarmatians. In favor of the existence of a generic organization among the early nomads, one can interpret Herodotus' message about the Scythian ethnogonic tradition, which elevated all Scythians to one ancestor, Targitaos, and his sons - Lipoxais, Arpoxais, and Kolaxais. The principle of genealogical kinship in this interpretation extended to the entire Scythian association. Meanwhile, there are reports from sources that may testify in favor of the existence of a sex-and-age division of the Sarmatian society. Nicholas of Damascus reports that Scythians jointly own property and women, so that the eldest of them are considered fathers, the youngest sons, and peers brothers. Nicholas of Damascus is believed to follow the tradition of the Ephor idealization of Scythians, like Pseudo-Scymnus. But these reports about the just Scythians may contain specific ethnographic details. This information can be interpreted as a direct evidence of the age classes of Scythians. The inherited status can be traced by archaeological data, which allows archaeology to be involved in solving these problems. A source such as tamga signs is fundamentally important for the analysis of the generic organization. The generally accepted view is that tamgas are signs of belonging to a family and a clan. The clan requires special attention due to the contradictions between the scientific tradition, the data of sources and modern anthropological theory. The idea of the clan as a universal institution at the early stages of the development of human society has been convincingly refuted. Kinship is a single structure-forming principle of social systems operating at the early stages of society's development, but it implies different institutions and practices. Social organisation of the Turkic- and Mongolian-speaking nomads of the Eurasian steppes cannot be automatically transferred to the social organisation of the early nomads, mainly Iranian-speaking. Moreover, we cannot say that the early nomads necessarily had a genealogical principle of origin. According to V.A. Popov and N.M. Girenko, the clan appears in the late stages of primitiveness. The genealogical (linear) principle of kinship counting replaced the group (lateral) one. In lateral systems, continuity was carried out from group to group, and, in linear systems, individual continuity dominates. The article shows that the use of the concepts "clan", "generic", "tribal" in relation to the early nomads is more a tribute to the historiographical tradition than the result of a source analysis. The concepts of gamma epsilon nu omicron sigma similar to gens of ancient authors may hide not only the generic organization, but also other social and political institutions.

AB In Soviet Russia in 1924, an unstable equilibrium was established between the new government and the old intelligentsia. Scholars of modern Western history enjoyed a certain level of freedom in their choice of research themes and could publish abroad; those who demonstrated a favourable attitude towards official policy were granted a certain freedom of opinion and scientific debate was possible. However, the government exploited the authority of intellectuals to increase its own prestige and sweeten the Nation's image abroad, presenting it as an idyllic place. This paper will demonstrate how this equilibrium was broken, how and why power shifted towards a use of violence and how, despite this, historians sought to carry out their work in such a precarious political situation. Relations with their foreign colleagues were first interrupted and then ceased all together and only lines of research imposed by the Party prevailed. Soviet historical science was excluded from European scientific dialogue and lost a large part of its appeal at international level. These events affected the natural process of generational change and young Marxist historians took over from their predecessors whose lives, on occasion, met with fatal consequences.

AB The research is devoted to the key issues of currency internationalization (CI) that means much for world economic order changing and multipolar development. The purpose of the article is to determine the role of state and influence of political and economic factors on CI processes as well as work out recommendations and possible variant of reform vector for Russian Ruble development. There are five conceptual approaches to construct the combined classification of the CI stages proposed for accurate CI level definition and the detailed finalized categorization of its main factors. The article also discusses the CI standard benefits and the most common threats. The research includes investigation and comparative analysis of the three representative examples of international CI experience - namely the US, the European with about a 20-year "free CI" practice for euro and the deeply regulated Chinese model. The results reaffirm top status of the US dollar and highlevel position of euro, but attach importance to political factors in achieving it and provide insight into the RMB strategy and CI progress, thus demonstrating how developing countries change peripheral role in the world economy. The Russian monetary and financial policy of 1990-2019 is specified as the "cold" one with weak status of the Ruble, but we reveal and assess some recent steps on CI activation such as bilateral stimulation of settlements in national currencies, creation of alternative systems, the digital Ruble project analysis, the decision on payments for gas in Rubles, etc. These measures can be considered as forced CI and the starting point of its vector. According to main findings we also propose the mechanisms for further Russian CI strategy creation.

DT Article
DE intellectual migration; "brain drain"; Central Asia; migration processes
ID MOBILITY
AB Intellectual migration is a key element of migration processes in Central Asia, but this topic remains insufficiently studied. In this article, the authors undertake the first attempt to comprehensively analyze the challenges of "brain drain" for the region's countries. Conceptually, the research is based on developments in the field of migration studies, in particular on the push-pull approach, as well as the idea of relational and aspirational factors of intellectual migration. Methodologically, the study relies on discourse and documentary analysis, systems approach, statistical and survey methods. The authors discover that the topic of intellectual migration in the regional research discourse is presented fragmentarily, as its attention is mainly concentrated on international students mobility trends in the region. It is argued that state regulation of the intellectual migration in Central Asian countries has its own specific features - some are trying to use intellectual migration to stabilize the situation on national labor markets, to contain domestic protest potential, others are looking for an adequate model for turning the "brain drain" trends into "brain gain", especially through the use of their diaspora's resources. At the same time, the scale of educational emigration from the region shows growth patterns, which generates serious challenges for the Central Asian states, since a large proportion of foreign universities graduates from the region do not want to return to their countries. Based on the analysis of current trends, it is concluded that Central Asian states have all the economic and socio-political motives for intellectual emigration. In this context, out of the three scenarios for the development of international migration processes in Central Asia presented by the authors - a favorable scenario, a status quo scenario and a negative scenario - the latter seems to be the most probable at this stage. Accordingly, without systematic reforms and a serious approach to the problem of intellectual migration, the prospects for the implementation of the development strategies of the region's countries will become vague, which is a challenge for their societal stability and national security.

AB The article addresses the issue of securitization of Basque separatism. The author argues that Basque nationalist groups have transformed the problem of self-determination into matter of security and reveals the ways where and why it happens. The research is based on the Copenhagen School securitization concept and has been conducted on the basis of data obtained from Twitter accounts of Basque nationalist leaders with the use of qualitative data analysis methods in Atlas.ti research software. The analysis covers period from January 2017 - October 2021. The research revealed that Basque nationalist parties are different in understanding the necessity of self-determination. Radical political groups such as EH Bildu prefer societal securitization on the basis of identity while moderate nationalist groups prioritize transnational ideas such as "Europe of the regions" concept. The author assumes that the way of securitization was taken due to the growing disinterest of society in historical and cultural roots of Basque self-determination. The analysis shows that securitizing of separatism is a growing trend in nationalist discourse. This trend is monitored carefully due to its propensity to pose a terrorist threat. At the same time the author emphasizes a high level of interdependence between European regions. The instability in Basque Country may cause problems in other European regions where the issues of nationalism are at the top of the agenda.

AB Sasanian period in the history of Caucasian Albania is characterized by its close interaction with Iran in the religious and ideological sphere, which took place within the framework of political contacts and has been marked since the first decades of the establishment of the Sasanian dynasty in Iran. After the signing of the Edict of Milan (AD 313), which proclaimed religious tolerance in the territory of the Roman Empire and was an important step towards the transformation of Christianity into the official religion of the Empire, Armenia, and then Iberia and Albania declared Christianity as their state religion, and this was regarded by Iran as their political and ideological subordination to Rome. Certain periods in the history of Albania are characterized by a tough confrontation between two religious systems. But at the same time, the main trend in the relationship between Christianity and Zoroastrianism in the East Caucasus was characterized by relative tolerance and was due to the geopolitical significance of the region, Iran's internal policy, the emerging diplomatic situation and other factors.

AB The article analyzes political, social, economic and cultural consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for French society. The national strategies of the state management of the sanitary crisis that have developed in the world are investigated: the strategy of "zero tolerance to coronavirus"; the strategy of free circulation of the virus; the strategy determined by the formula "stop and go". France, like many other Western countries, chose the last one, which implied a combination of harsh measures (lockdown, self-isolation, mandatory vaccination, introduction of sanitary passes) with relaxation caused by the demands of business and society. The increased role of the State in the fight against the pandemic is revealed. The political context of the pandemic crisis settlement is revealed: centralization of power; tight control of the head of state over the activities of the Cabinet of Ministers; dominance of political power over the professional medical community; reduction of the parliament's role. It is shown that under conditions of the sanitary crisis, the process of informatization of production and services accelerated, significant shifts occurred in the labor market, and there was an increase in social and socio-spatial inequality. The problem of the middle class, which continues to fragment, is acute. The pandemic and especially the methods of combating it caused a protest in French society: the French did not just express disbelief in the effectiveness of the vaccine, with their speeches they demonstrated distrust of the authorities and state institutions. The pandemic has shown that France is in dire need of a new social compromise that would take into account not only the interests of global corporations, but also people who have remained beyond the threshold of the information economy. The issue of reviewing the lowest salaries and raising the status of a number of professions is acute.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE liberal democracy; traditionalism; antitraditionalism; Marxism; soviet
   morality; new ethics; sexual; morality; gender policy
AB The article analyzes the role of Russia in the framework of the current opposition of traditionalists to Western anti-identity influence. In this context, anti-identity is the main characteristic of the modern "new liberalism", or liberal democracy. It is emphasized that the "new liberalism" has little to do with traditional European liberalism, it has completely different roots, which go also into the Russian soil. The authors see the origins of the "new liberalism" in Marxism, on the basis of which the ideology of overcoming identity was born in the second half of the 20th century. The dictatorship of minorities and a specific form of ostracism - Cancel culture - have become a tool for combating identity as the need to realize one's connection with any community and its values. In contrast to Western countries, radical forms of anti-identity in Russia were already embodied by the Bolsheviks after the 1917 revolution in the field of gender policy, sexual morality and the national question. The rollback of Soviet policy from Bolshevik maximalism did not lead to a complete return to traditional values, which especially affected family values. From the point of view of the Central and Eastern European traditionalists (Poland, Hungary), whom the leaders of the European Union consider authoritarians, Russia is a defender of traditional values, but there were no statements that the Russian government embodies "true European values" and the ideals of "real" democracy. For many conservative politicians in Western Europe and the USA (Protestants and Catholics, Muslims), although Russia is important as a country that opposes anti-identity, its role is largely symbolic, since in Russia there are no influential political and significant public circles that consistently defend, for example, biblical values, like in the United States (prohibition of abortion, in addition to rejecting same-sex marriage, a high degree of religiosity and protection of the interests of their church, following biblical norms in life).

AB The article examines semantics of obshchestvennyy and sotsial'nyy based on the data of etymological, historical, explanatory Russian dictionaries (from the 11th to the 21st centuries). The aim of the work is to identify semantic similarities and differences of the lexemes in different historical periods. The research material is definitions and illustrative materials included in dictionary entries. Research methods are comparative and semantic. During the study the development of meanings for the lexemes was established. Sotsial 'nyy at the Indo-European level is "allied". The lexeme came to Russian from French as "relating to society" (1850s). Obshchestvennyy is of Slavic origin, from Russian obshchestvo, goes back to *obtj.b "widespread around", then Old Russian-Church Slavonic obshchiy "referring to all or a group of people", "common", then Old Church Slavonic ob 'sht'stvo "community, kinship" and Russian-Church Slavonic "a set of people united by a common life way", "a class of people; a gathering of people with a common intention or subject". In the sources from the 11th to the 21st centuries obshchestvennyy almost never occurs. In the 18th century under the semantic influence of obshchestvo, meanings of obshchestvennyy are formed: "relating to the people"; "state, political, civil"; "belonging to a group, an association of people"; "associated with a group of friends"; "typical of the high society"; "relevant to the public"; "owned by all"; "general". In the 19th century the basic meanings of obshchestvennyy and sotsial'nyy contain the seme "society", but the words also have differences. The first word implies an attitude towards society as a people, a state, and the second to its advanced part and to citizenship. Obshchestvennyy is also "appropriated to society", "general", "secular" (about a peasant community), and sotsial'nyy is "related to socialism". In the 20th and 21st centuries the basic meanings of obshchestvennyy and sotsial'nyy are the same. However, obshchestvennyy is more often used in everyday speech, and sotsial'nyy in scientific. Obshchestvennyy in modern Russian emphasizes belonging to society, joint ownership of property in a collective, focus on meeting social needs. It also indicates the relationship and position of people in society, the expression of a position by society. Sotsial 'nyy describes the structure of a class society and relations in it, as well as the participation of the state in its life. Sotsial 'nyy has the semantic component "aimed at changing the social order", which is recorded in dictionaries of the 20th century and is absent in the sources of the 21st century. Thus, the semantics of obshchestvennyy was formed in the 18th century. Its polysemy is explained by the fact that the root obshch- is original for Russian. The semantics of sotsial 'nyy is based on French social,-e "relating to society", is associated with sociality and socialism. Nowadays, the words are often synonymous with different stylistic connotations.

AB Elections to the Russian State Duma provide a unique context to study the representation of women and ethnic minorities in a national legislature. Russian elections have witnessed dramatic institutional variation, including a shift from semi-democratic contestation to competitive authoritarianism and the use of different electoral systems. Moreover, ethnic federalism has produced political and demographic conditions that promote the representation of titular ethnic groups in ethnic republics. Finally, the transition from a fragmented party system to one controlled by a single dominant party potentially has important potential ramifications for women and minority representation. We use a unique dataset that codes the ethnicity and sex of individual legislators for each election from 1993 to 2021 to examine how regime type, electoral rules, demographic conditions, and party affiliation have affected descriptive representation in Russia. Using similar data on selected states from Eastern Europe, we compare Russia's experience with that of other postcommunist states as well as the United States.

AB Divided societies project new cleavages into the contemporary divided world. Assessing cleavages as drivers of social change and evaluating their positive potential versus evident negative impacts is a key element in forecasting prospects of social development. The paper addresses social and economic statistical data, opinion polls and academic research input of the past decade to prove the need to balance tradition and innovation and combine tangible and intangible assets to support the progress of national and local communities. The trend to reduce social inequalities is an important criterion for evaluating the strategic consistency of such policies, whereas the main contextual factor important for their success is the dynamics of support for these policies and the engagement of citizens and communities in their implementation. The example of Ireland as a society that has managed to integrate divisions of the nation and of its historic territory into its development strategies and to promote past cultural traumas as drivers of social cohesion with a long-lasting effect is a representative case in this sense. This case is relevant for explaining the pendulum effects of economic development that can be compensated by consistent social policies, and by recurring to intangible cultural resources and diaspora support to promote an inclusive national identity. Ongoing deep transformations of the existing world order are creating new political spaces, and recourse to intangible resources of development may stimulate a reevaluation of the current conflictual political agenda.

AB The key political figure in the East of Russia during the Civil War was Pyotr Vasilyevich Vologodsky (1863-1925), the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Provisional Siberian Government, then the Provisional All-Russian Government and the Russian Government. He left an abundance of sources of information, diverse in form and content, about his activities as the prime minister Among them, a special place is occupied by interviews published in numerous and diverse periodicals of that time. A study of the periodical press published on the territory controlled by the Provisional Siberian Government, the Provisional All-Russian Government and the Russian Government of Admiral Kolchak revealed a complex of interviews with Prime Minister Vologodsky. The author examined the circumstances of their publication and analyzed the subject matter and the main content of the texts. During the eighteen months in the position of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, from 30 June 1918 to 22 November 1919, Vologodsky gave detailed political interviews to the Russian-language press at least 13 times and had at least five conversations with foreign correspondents. In addition, three political documents drawn up in the government and sanctioned by the Prime Minister were published in the form of an "interview with Pyotr Vologodsky", as well as a series of socio-political articles by Andrei Adrianov. The author has established that the prime minister, mainly personally, without intermediaries, interacted with major influential socio-political periodicals that represented a wide ideological and political spectrum of the counter-revolution - from Social Revolutionaries to right-wing Cadets. At the same time, Vologodsky communicated more frequently and meaningfully with the editor of Sibirskaya zhizn ' [Siberian Life] and the staff of Zarya [Dawn], who represented the so-called political "center" of the counter-revolution in Eastern Russia and personally supported the prime minister Vologodsky gave key interviews in difficult political conditions, experiencing real or imaginary threats of resignation and the collapse of the Council of Ministers. In the mode of impulsive dialogue, he "responded" to the challenges of political opponents and "requested" the support of his proponents. Most of Vologodsky's interviews should be viewed primarily as a struggle for preserving the power of the Council of Ministers. In this context, publications in the press represent a complex of informative sources about the activities of the head of the anti-Bolshevik governments, including his opinions, political assessments and emotions relevant to that time, the level of understanding the situation, communication style and ways of using information.

AB The article examines the functioning of the institution of the presidency in the political system of Austria 1945-2022. The constitutional framework and the real possibilities of the heads of state are determined. The conclusion is made about the relative comparability of their participation in the political life of the country with the practical actions of the heads of Austrian governments of the post-war period. The connection of the presidents with the leading political parties that nominated them - the Social Democratic (SPO) and the Austrian People's Party (OVP) - is evaluated. The creation of the Social Democrats were mainly authoritative functionaries of this movement, and the OVP relied on diplomats and officials of the international level. In the first two decades of the XXI century, the Greens and nationalists from the Austrian Freedom Party (FPO) actively joined the struggle for the presidency. The European Union was interested in keeping the post of head of the Austrian state in the hands of pro-European figures. The author believes that the external factor, both in the past and at the present time, influences the formation of the highest executive authorities of Austria.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE pandemics; Western Balkans; Kosovo; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Security;
   European Union
AB The article analyses influence of the pandemics on economic and political developments as well as on the conflict resolution process in the Western Balkan (WB) region. The unprecedented epidemiological conditions of the years 2020-2021 led to utter deterioration of regional economic rates. Serbia can be named as the only exception with its GDP growth in 2020 (although also negative) higher than the regional and, moreover, European average. Negative political consequences of the two recent years with COVID-19, observed in the article, range from the rise of "covidocracy", namely strengthening of executive institutions at the expense of the local parliaments, courts and media freedom, to the landmark changes in political elites of Montenegro and Kosovo as well as deterioration of conflicts in Kosovo and Bosnia. The pandemics has also negatively affected the pace of the European integration process in the region. The slowdown was connected both with turbulences inside the EU given its initial lack of solidarity and with an attempt to address the crisis on the national rather than on the European level, its consequent emphasis on the internal rather than external development. The EU perspective as such has grown more distant from the Western Balkans. Yet, regional cooperation with the introduction of the "Open Balkans" initiative has accelerated, which has been designed to bring the WB countries closer to the European common market. At the same time, the pandemics significantly strengthened Russian and Chinese presence in the region, which provoked the EU into geopolitical race. The author comes to a conclusion, however, that eventually, the European assistance can be characterized as systemic and structural, masterminded within the context of future WB integration in the EU institutions. Nevertheless, European mediation in the situation of stalemate in Belgrade-Pristina negotiations could not prevent serious degradation of the conflict over Kosovo's status. In Bosnia, former High Representative's imposition of the Genocide denial ban also sparked off the crisis, which puts the future of a unified Bosnian state into question. These negative developments in conflict management, to some extent triggered by the pandemics, can impair stabilization process and security in the Western Balkans.

AB The article analyses the Russian historiographical heritage of German settlers in Bessarabia in the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century, the least researched period in Russian history. The historical Bessarabia territory is currently part of the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine. Despite using the same documents, the studies on the Germans of Bessarabia reach different conclusions because they depended on the political conjuncture in which the papers were written. Russian authors of the 19th - the first decades of the 20th centuries viewed German settlers' ethnic, confessional and agricultural development in Bessarabia from different angles, often guided by their subjective impressions. The researchers covering this period relied exclusively on the recollections of contemporaries of German ancestors who had been living in Bessarabia since the beginning of the 19th century. Often, the authors used unverified propaganda information. In this paper, printed sources from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were used to create a coherent image of the German population in Bessarabia and reflect the attitudes of Russian scientists and authorities regarding this ethnical group of immigrants who endured great hardship.

AB The article analyzes the main trends of Turkish discussions on the issue of Turkey-NATO relations. NATO membership has been one of the most important areas of Ankara's foreign policy since the Cold War to the present day. At the same time, these relations are the subject of diverging assessments of Turkish researchers who do not lose interest in this topic, preparing papers concerning both the historical aspects of the issue and modern problems. The reasons and consequences of Turkey's accession to NATO continue to attract wide attention. This topic is more or less covered in almost all Turkish publications. The Turkish experts also share significant interest in the issue of Ankara's contribution to the activities of the alliance. At present this problem is acquiring a different dimension due to the emergence of new tasks for NATO and Turkey's search for its new mission, both within the alliance and in changing geopolitical realities. Traditionally high level of anti-NATO sentiment in Turkey, which is confirmed by the latest public opinion polls, remains an important aspect of the problem. The discussions of Turkish researchers regarding the prospects, strengths and weaknesses of Turkey-NATO relations are a reaction to political events affecting Ankara's cooperation with Western countries.

DE abduction; dialog; argumentative schemes
ID INFERENCE
AB The paper scrutinizes contemporary treatments of abduction, as they occur in logic, epistemology and philosophy of science. It demonstrates how these positions can be adapted to the argumentation theory needs. The publication begins with a brief historical survey and continues with two major contemporary approaches of abduction studies presentation (the Magnani conception and the model of Gabbay and Woods). The last section analyzes contemporary treatments of abduction from the dialectical perspective. First of all, this step specifies the role of dialogs (Hintikka has already pointed to the advantages of the interrogative essence of abduction). Second, it clarifies the differences between abduction and explanation as well as between abduction and heuristics. Formal models or logics of abduction are mostly left aside. Due to Peirce's famous solution, abduction is an inference that provides a reason to suspect that the hypothesis is true. Peirce's scheme (Harvard lectures) provides a general understanding of abduction but ignores some problems: it is not clear, if we generate a hypothesis or adapt it, how the hypothesis appears, etc. As a result, abduction has been linked with reasoning to the best explanation. One of such solutions belongs to Josephson and Josephson. Their scheme had a great impact on the theory of argumentation. It was turned into a skeleton of Walton's argumentative scheme of abduction (the most influential scheme). Today we know that abduction should be better understood as an inference from the best expatiation rather than an inference to the best explanation. It is ignorance-preserving. The Gabbay-Woods model develops a similar treatment. It competes with another famous solution that belongs to Magnani. Both approaches reconstruct and explain the essence of abduction, but they have different assessments concerning its epistemological aims. If the first one classifies abduction as an ignorance-preserving inference, the latter protects its creative side (abduction has a knowledge-enhancing faculty). The Gabbay-Woods model is comparable with Peirce's abduction understanding that has been recently discovered and reconstructed by Pietarinen. Peirce claims that abduction presumes interrogative mood and conjectural nature. It does not assert the truth but delivers the idea of a matter of course, rendering that idea is comparatively simple and natural. The paper argues that the Gabbay-Woods model, enriched by Peirce's ideas, can be integrated into a dialog. It emphasizes the dialectical core of abduction and simplifies the analysis of existing argumentation schemes.

AB The scientific article examines transformation and some specific features of South Korean presidential political leadership in 1948-2021. The article is based on the English and Korean language literature of scientists and experts in the fields of political science and history, as well as on the author's interviews with experts in these fields. A choice of American scientists' literature on political leadership is conditioned by the fact that historically leader-oriented research and analysis have originated and proven extremely popular in the United States, which became a stronghold of research in this field.
   To begin with, the author dwells on the concept of "leadership" per se and explains the interest to the concept of "political leadership" in political and historical sciences. After that, a brief overview of classic leadership theories is provided to demonstrate a distinct difference between Western and Eastern approaches to analyzing political leadership. To this end, the Republic of Korea (ROK) represents a brilliant example of an Eastern country that has achieved tremendous progress in political, economic and social spheres over a period of one generation, including due to its political leadership. When analyzing what has driven the progress in South Korea to such an extent, the author emphasizes that presidential political leadership played one of the major roles in the nation building process. To elaborate on this, the author examines historical and cultural premises that have formed South Korean political leadership we know today. Among historical preconditions, the author puts stress on a long period of dependency on foreign states throughout the history of the united Korea, along with country division on South and North Koreas in 1948 followed by the devastating Korean War of 1950-1953. All those events had culminated in strengthening of South Korean nationalism and an aspiration to have a strong leader who could restore security and prosperity of the country. Thus, South Korean political leadership experienced harsh conditions at the very beginning of nation building, which is why a leader with military background was seen as the only one capable of securing an order and establishing a solid base for economic development.
   With regard to cultural preconditions, it is no exaggeration to say that Confucian legacy has played the key role as a cultural premise that rested against such virtues as subordination, personal and political order, moral duty and interpersonal relations. In addition, the author underlines an important role of an unofficial network of personal connections of a political leader. It usually represents ties between a political leader and his/her university, region, organization, etc. which provide him/her with strong support.
   Besides, the author sheds light on some current trends in presidential political leadership in South Korea. The author attempts to generalize about contribution of each of the ROK presidents to national building and development and analyze what type of presidential political leadership South Korea is more close to.
   The author concludes by providing a short summary on how the presidential political leadership in South Korea has transformed during 1948-2021 and how it might change in upcoming future. The author believes that a key dimension in understanding the current political dynamics in South Korea lies in a shift from the absolute power and personal influence of South Korean presidents in all spheres during 1948-1988 to a more restrained by political system role of the president after 1988, with his/her established political leadership.

AB The historical approach to Pyotr Lodiy's works made it possible to rethink his contribution to the formation of philosophy as an independent discipline and the development of university philosophical education in the Russian Empire. Lodiy laid down such ideas of socio-philosophical research as a critical analysis of philosophical concepts through the prism of personal practical experience, as well as aiming theoretical research on social problem solving. He made an invaluable contribution to the development of the philosophical framework of categories and concepts by introducing terminology of classical Western European philosophical systems to the Russian language. According to the comparative analysis, Lodiy's works were rather close to those of Immanuel Kant, since Lodiy agrees with Kant's categorical imperative. However, in Lodiy's opinion, it is not so much an individual moral duty as the social environment disposes a person to follow the moral categorical imperative.Lodiy argues that the goal of theoretical philosophy is practical philosophy, which, in turn, has an impact on social mores. Hence, it necessitates the state concern for the development of philosophical education. Due to Lodiy's activity, there appeared first doctors and professors of philosophy,who earned their academic degree at Saint Petersburg Imperial University. He also contributed much to the establishment of Russian philosophical schools and encouraged his disciples and followers to take interest in socio-political issues, which predetermined further development of philosophy in the Russian Empire.

DE ontology; historical and philosophical analysis; digital paradigm;

AB This article discusses the problem of determining the ontological meaning of the category "virtual reality" in the context of the formation of the digital paradigm. Currently, in the era of the implementation of the megatrends of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), the interdisciplinary consideration of such a sociocultural and technical phenomenon as virtual reality (VR) is being updated. Virtual reality as a given (along with objective and subjective reality), as an integral part of the modern worldview, determines the philosophical research and determination of its ontological status. The historical and philosophical analysis of metaphysical concepts carried out in this work focuses on the ontological possibility of virtual reality. The analysis shows that various philosophers and philosophical traditions have addressed the question of the ontological possibility of reality, different from the usual reality of the surrounding world, and answer it as follows: any reality is ontologically possible due to the action of certain laws of change in general and the implementation of the process "from possibility (dynamism) - through action (energy) - to realizability (entelechy)" (Aristotle); the ontological possibility of any reality finds its potential in our consciousness, because "everything is consciousness" (yogachara); transcending, going beyond the usual empirical explanation of reality, determines the manifestations of the a priori form of pure reason, expressed in the conclusion about the ontological possibility of reality (Kant). Thus, the thesis about the ontological possibility of any reality, including virtual reality, which in the process of implementation acquires objective (materialized, felt) and subjective (thought) characteristics, is substantiated. Currently, virtual reality is a full-fledged reality that has an ontological status, acquired during the creation and implementation of digital technologies, for example, such as virtual (VR), augmented (AR), mixed (MR) reality, the main purpose of which from a scientific point of view is to substantiate the digital picture of the world (digital paradigm), and from a sociocultural point of view to improve the quality of life of a modern person.

ID INTERNET
AB The categories of subject, agency and subjectivity in different approaches to the study of the Internet and digital culture are considered. These terms may have opposite meanings in different historical and academic contexts, placing the "subject" in active or passive voice. In critical theory, the subject and subjectivity cannot be thought without considering the issues of empowerment and oppression, which is a perspective that allows the conceptualization of the subject that is able to take into account cultural and gender differences, historical and situational processes of subjectification, a wide range of ethical issues as a key element of subjectivity. The complex relationships of a person with technological environment are also reflected in the critical studies of the Internet. As a subject of research, "subjectivity" in the above meaning practically does not appear in Russian-language academic literature, in which the concept of the subject as agent (of activity, socialization) prevails, and which accounts for a significant proportion of the Internet studies publications that adhere to the idea of digital technologies as symbolic tools that mediate different forms of activity. An overview of the issue of subjectification as a function of digital surveillance in the context of media consumption and political subjectivity on the Internet shows how the digital environment is intertwined with politics, education, healthcare systems and other institutions and practices. This requires such a conceptualization of subjectivity that avoids the trend to study an individual only as an agent of activity outside normative social systems, not reducing persons to institutional discourses, but taking into account that they interact in a unique way with their emotionality and motivational sphere. The critical concept of the subject should take into account that the digital environment, being a phenomenon much more than merely an activity mediating tool, provides not only new opportunities for the disciplinary construction of the subject, but also those for configuring one's discursive resources and idiosyncratic subjectivities, allowing a person to take subordinate, negotiated and subversive positions with respect to dominant institutional orders.

AB The research aims to identify positive and negative types of class solidarity among young people of the new working class in modern Russia and gender differences in their manifestation. In the article, the concept of a new working class is used, which is not associated with the upcoming digitalization of the economy or an increase in the level of workers' professional education, but with the nature of labor, property relations and participation in management. The research methodology is based on the intersectional approach. The article contains the formulation and experience of solving a new research task - the formation of class solidarity of working-class youth in the context of the conflicting requirements of corporate culture and social status. Empirical data were obtained during the implementation of a collective project (2017-2021) on the territory of the Ural Federal District using quantitative and qualitative sociological methods (mass survey, biographical interview). It has been revealed that the absolute majority of young workers are aware of their class affiliation and the need for solidarity practices in defending their own interests, including opposition to the class of owners. The most deprived part of the working class today is the female group of young adults (25-29 years old), employed in the service sector of the economy.

AB The relevance of the work is caused by the socio-political demand to change the criminal procedural law, taking into account its focus on the creation of a favourable investment and business climate. At the same time, science has not convincingly justified the real reasons for changing the criminal procedural law in this direction, which leads to its chaotic changes, often inconsistent with the fundamental principles of criminal procedure, its purpose.
   The purpose of the work is to study the impact of legal norms ensuring the implementation of "amnesty of capital" on the free evaluation of evidence, as well as its ability to ensure the implementation of public interest of all members of society aimed at combating crime.
   The following set of research methods was used effectively. First, the dialectical method of knowledge - as a key method in the consideration of legal norms that ensure the implementation of "amnesty of capital" in relation to the general problems of criminal procedure. Secondly, the method of modelling - in the study of how the theory and law enforcement practice will be affected by the change in the criminal procedural form caused by the "amnesty of capital". Thirdly, the formal-legal method - in identifying the specifics of the construction of legal constructions in the rules of criminal procedure providing for "amnesty of capital". Fourthly, the historical-legal method - in the analysis of legal constructions and the practice of their application at different stages of historical development. Fifth, the statistical method - in the collection and analysis of statistical data relating to the research topic.
   The results of the study lead to the following conclusions.
   Firstly, the free assessment of evidence and the statutory rules of evidence collection, aimed at the development of inner conviction, are mutually supportive, resulting in the publicity of criminal proceedings.
   Secondly, legal rules ensuring the implementation of "capital amnesty" exclude the free assessment of evidence and introduce a formal approach to both its collection and assessment, which results in the loss of publicity of criminal proceedings.
   Thirdly, the reason for the rejection of free assessment of evidence is the legislator's mistrust of the officials of the preliminary investigation agencies and the court. The reasons for this distrust lie in the lack of proper motivation and reasonableness of their decisions.
   Fourthly, it is concluded that it is inadmissible to conceptually transform the criminal procedural law with economic interests, distrust of the court and officials of the preliminary investigation bodies. In this connection, it is proposed either to abandon the continuation of the "capital amnesty" or to no longer consider acts for which criminal responsibility is suspended as a crime, but rather as administrative offences or criminal misdemeanours.

The election campaign had pooled the main attention and resources of the Canadian leadership, limiting its ability to act in Afghanistan. Despite the difficulties, the Liberal Government of Justin Trudeau has achieved a lot. Firstly, they have organized the evacuation of Canadians and of Afghans who worked with the Canadian Armed Forces during the US and NATO military mission. Secondly, Ottawa has defined its attitude towards the Taliban regime by refusing diplomatic recognition. Thirdly, the admission of Afghan refugees to Canada has begun. In each of these areas, the Liberal Government has successes and failures, which have caused acute controversy in the country.

AB The article aims to identify the impact of climate change on cities in a pandemic. It is shown that the improvement of the ecological state in the world as a whole at the initial stage of the pandemic began to change to the previous levels of environmental pollution as restrictive measures were weakened. Predictably, the impact of COVID-19 has been most devastating in poor and densely populated urban areas, especially for the one billion people living in self-contained settlements and slums around the world. Overcrowding in such places has made it difficult to comply with measures recommended by the World Health Organization such as social distancing and self-isolation. The article raises questions about the reversibility of the transformations that occurred during the pandemic in the daily life of urban residents and the role that cities will play in the future. Particular attention is paid to the initiatives of the European Union to include cities in the implementation of the Green Deal, taking into account its actualization under the influence of the pandemic. Conclusions are drawn that the role of cities in the implementation of environmental objectives and reformatting urban space and infrastructure in the interests of nature and man is increasing. The pandemic has accelerated the process of transition to new environmental standards in the context of increasing the sustainability of cities and the flexibility of their adaptation mechanisms in case of crisis situations. The experience of the European Union in this case can serve as a good example for other regions, countries and cities. The impact of climate issues on the existing and projected infrastructure of cities in the context of the tasks of increasing their sustainability and further application of "smart" technologies to ensure the safety and comfort of human life in the city has increased. The author concludes that for cities that have taken the brunt of the COVID-19 virus, there is still a time lag for transforming their planning and infrastructure in such a way as to enhance the quality of life of the population, its security and saturation of the "desired image of the city" with new elements based on digitalization tools. It is precisely this behavior of cities that is being pushed by the demand of the population - according to surveys of various regional and global agencies, during the pandemic, the proportion of respondents who consider climate change as one of the acute problems of our time has increased.

AB The article reveals the details about the activities of the journalist Lev V. Arnoldov (1894, Russia - 1957, Brazil) during the Civil War in Russia and his emigration to China, where he was one of the most prominent figures of the Russian diaspora. Most sources of information about him, as well as his publications of the emigration period, are located abroad, mainly in the United States; therefore, Arnoldov's name is little known in Russia. Meanwhile, his life is a unique example of a person's adaptation to difficult, often tragic circumstances, the search for his place in new living conditions. Not accepting Soviet power, Arnoldov joined the anti-Bolshevik forces. As a student at Tomsk University, he began publishing articles in support of the White Movement, then he headed the Press Affairs Department of the Provisional All-Russian Government, and was the director of the Foreign Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the government of Admiral Kolchak. Performing the task of propaganda of white governments, he contributed to the financial and moral support of Kolchak's dictatorship by other states. Having emigrated to China in August 1920, Arnoldov first worked in Harbin newspapers and founded (together with S.Ya. Alymov) the publishing house and The Rupor newspaper, but his talent as a publicist was especially pronounced in the Shankhayskaya Zarya (The Shanghai Dawn) newspaper (1925-1945). He was its editor for more than twenty years. The most successful Russian newspaper in China, Shankhayskaya Zarya was popular among expats due to its political indifference and attention to the acute issues of the emigrant life in China, such as unemployment, prostitution, youth problems, and relations with the Chinese. Covering these topics, Arnoldov declared himself as a talented Sinologist, publishing a number of works of ethnographic and political science and teaching Sinology at Shanghai Commercial College. He also wrote his memoirs which are a unique source of information about Russia in 1905-1920. He also proved himself to be a public figure in Russian emigration, becoming a founder and an active participant in several Russian associations of creative professions in China, e.g., the Writer and Journalist Union in Shanghai, Ponedel'nik (Monday), KhLAM, and Zelyonaya Lampa (the Green Lamp). In the article, previously unknown materials from the Museum of Russian Culture in San Francisco and a collection of Russian press in China from the Hamilton Library of the University of Hawaii (Honolulu) were used. They gave the opportunity to determine Arnoldov's place in the Russian emigration in China and to assess his contribution to journalism, science and the social activities of the Russian diaspora in this country.

AB The theory of human capital of Nobel Prize laureates in Economics Theodore Schultz and Gary Becker, which became the key idea of the era of the birth of the postindustrial information society in the second half of the past century, first raised the question about the special role of qualified personnel in the long-term growth of the country. Schultz stated the need to invest in the individual as a component of the aggregate, and Becker, in turn, supported this thesis with a number of calculations that demonstrated the advantages of workers with special education over their colleagues without it. In fact, this was the first publicly available confirmation of the economic efficiency of such a philosophical category as knowledge. Today, with all the variety of scientific interpretations of the term "human capital" - from the main element of the state's wealth to the creative abilities of the individual - the concept "knowledge", highlighted by Becker, remains its absolute center and the most important inseparable part. At the same time, just in our days, the period of seemingly marginal accumulation of human capital begins to feel, so to speak, a narrowing of its core - human knowledge. Let us try to support the stated thesis with a few convincing illustrations. Let us start with an article by the authoritative modern philosopher Haridimos Tsukas (University of Cyprus), which received the unusual title "The tyranny of light: The temptations and the paradoxes of the information society" and was published in 1997. The author builds the following logical chain. In our time, the concept "information" replaces the classical definition of the term "knowledge". Information, in turn, is now tacitly understood as a system of skills for the functional use of technologies. The instrumental ease with which such manuals are collected, processed, stored, retrieved, and distributed is a substitute, making it seem that they are objective, and therefore do not require confirmation or clarification. More than 20 years have passed since the publication of this research, let us add one more link to the chain: the readiness of the society to accept this postulate and the lack of information evidence, unconditionally acutely felt today, raise the question of a conscious social rejection of knowledge as a verifiable category. The main aim of the work is an empirical verification of the question posed in its title. In order to study the problem in depth, a questionnaire consisting of 12 closed questions was developed. The content of the questionnaire was represented by 8 situational tasks that the respondents were asked to resolve. The targeted part of the observation program included 4 factor characteristics (gender, age, occupation, educational level of the respondents) according to the research hypotheses that determine the answer to its main question. The survey was attended by 1045 spontaneous informants, whose responses revealed representative mass trends. The results of the empirical study, entitled "Decision-making mechanisms in modern conditions", showed that, first, the overwhelming majority of the survey participants identified themselves as active supporters of self-learning in an unfamiliar field of knowledge, using data provided in the Internet.
   This contradicted the fact that, second, with the addition of the specified circumstances, the readiness to search for information decreased among respondents with the complication of the situational task. Third, the willingness to choose the services of a professional specialist did not show any dependence on the gender and age. Fourth, the participants with the highest predicate of received education demonstrated the highest informational independence. The empirical study was conducted in the pre-pandemic period, so the value of its results lies in a certain reflection of the degree of Russian society's readiness to introduce restrictive measures.

   the image of the enemy
AB The aim of this work is to reconstruct the content and define key characteristics and methods of forming the image of an external enemy in the Soviet agitation and propaganda materials during the Civil War (from January 1918 to January 1920). A typology of images is carried out, with the help of which the new government formed ideas about an external enemy, based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the content of newspaper publications and poster plots. The analysis of the image of the interventionists as a "hostile Other", which was formed on the pages of the press and with the help of poster graphics, has made it possible to characterize the methods and techniques, as well as the values of the Soviet propaganda in this period.
   The methods of forming the image of an external enemy at the textual and figurative-symbolic level did not always have clear boundaries of application, often mixing up within the same message / text - a poster or a newspaper article. Visual images and symbols of various types could be present within the same plot. Mocking and revealing couplets were combined with invocative slogans. A look at the "hostile Other" through the class optics did not exclude the use of a metaphorical language of description, which included zoomorphic images and stereotypical ideas about one or another former allied power. The combination of socio-political and national-symbolic stereotyping, coupled with the using of language and visual techniques for the purpose of dehumanization and ridiculing, made it possible to form a multidimensional image of the enemy. On the one hand, it was the personification and bearer of a system of exploitation and oppression that was hostile to the new Soviet regime. At the same time, it was firmly connected with the internal opponents of the Bolsheviks at the class level. On the other hand, the image was both monolithic (bourgeois states/governments, capitalists / imperialists) and fragmented (individual countries, politicians, governments, interventionist troops). The ambivalence of the hostile image of the interventionists was achieved by using a set of recognizable and easily perceived characteristics. They were based on familiar and replicated language and visual components, as well as on developed, unified and reproducible message-to-message confrontation schemes that were based on class-specific perception of the current conflict. One could imagine a kind of narrative "about the construction of a new world". The main positive characters of this narrative were the Bolsheviks themselves, the world and Russian proletariat. The former allies were seen as a part of the world imperialist system. No distinction was made between internal and external "counter-revolution". At the same time, the variability of approaches and formats demonstrates a wide range of political metaphors, some of which were dictated not only by the doctrinal principles of the Bolsheviks, but also by a set of archetypal ideas based on deeper mental codes

AB The article defines the specifics of the non-classical paradigm of the philosophy of language, in the problematic field of which the language is presented as a creative process and a form of development of the spirit, spiritual creativity and acquisition the truth. Revealing the specifics of the non-classical stage of the philosophy of language, within the limits of which the language is characterized as creative processuality, the author shows that the energy of the spirit, manifesting its spontaneity in the language, unattainable in its spontaneity, makes the language alive.
   It is shown that the philosophy of language as an independent science begins the countdown with the works of W. von Humboldt, while at an earlier stage, language was the subject of analysis in the context of general epistemological issues. The author analyzes the role of F. de Saussure in the development of the philosophy of language, reveals the role of the linguistic revolution in the transformation of the paradigm of the metaphysics of language. It is shown that, starting from the linguistic turn, a new problematic is introduced into the philosophy of language: an approach has been formed in the problem field of non-classical philosophy, within which the language was given the status of an alternative to the Cartesian cogito. It was the linguistic turn that was the stage of transition to the new problems of the philosophy of language, which made the subject of study the contexts and premises of utterances, objectified language structures, the polysemy and everyday functioning of the language, the functions of the language (including political functions). A departure from the epistemological and psychological component of research is associated with a linguistic turn, interest in the meaning and meaning was formed, and the language itself was interpreted as the ultimate ontological basis of thinking. Structuralism, hermeneutics, linguistic philosophy turned to the study of language. As a result of the linguistic turn, philosophical problems acquired a different orientation and began to search for philosophical problems through an appeal to the ontology of linguistic phenomena.

DE "taking care of oneself"; Michel Foucault; Leo Tolstoy; asceticism;
   wandering; transgression
AB The aim of the article is to consider the way of creating subjectivity through transition, transgression, overcoming as a part of the intellectual biography of Foucault and Tolstoy, which will make it possible to designate their common understanding of the "genuine" as necessarily opposed to the systemic, universal. Foucault's interpretation of the concept epimeleia heautou is criticized for subjectivist interpretation, aestheticization. As a counterargument, an expanded interpretation of the meaning of these practices as hermeneutic procedures for gaining access to truth and self-knowledge is given. The ethics developed by Foucault is based not on accumulation, but, on the contrary, on cleansing from excess, intemperance, from outwardly "normal", comfortable, and therefore not free. Self-denial, desubjectivization, the experience of the marginal, the borderline are a necessary condition for "constituting oneself' or "taking care of oneself'. As a result, subjectivation is a transition from non-subjectivity to subjectivity, constituting oneself as a moral subject through ethical problematization of one's sexual behavior and building it with the help of special techniques of "stylizing" life. In Tolstoy's case, the question of creating subjectivity through belittling it requires us to dwell on the theme of wandering in the writer's mind. Spiritual rebirth, according to Tolstoy, is impossible without gaining independence from the external world, which means that it requires a person to realize their indifference to the world and the world to them, to dissolve in this impersonal world, and to lose their individuality. Only in this belittling is it possible to comprehend participation in everything in the world, its responsibility for everything that happens in the world, the experience of universal imperfection and sinfulness. Thus, self-denial and belittling of the personality appear not as a spiritual feat, but as a necessary condition for liberation from compulsion, from external causal dependence, that is, the finite, on the path to the divine, the infinite. The Stoic doctrine represents the condition of a dignified life for the liberation of the individual from various forms of power. The ways to get rid of this power were different: Foucault chose the path of self-creation, constituting "I" and knowing his capabilities as an author through his research activities and eccentric life forms; Tolstoy chose the path of forgetting himself as an author, leaving in order to get lost in the world, gaining the integrity of the personality through belittling its social status. Despite the difference in the chosen path, the desired goal for both seems common.

DE semantics; context; deferred interpretation; types and tokens;
   pragmatics
AB In this commentary on Olga Kozyreva's paper, the author points at aspects that require a more detailed discussion and justification. The author argues that Kozyreva does not lay out her proposed theory explicitly enough for one to assess how justified her broader conclusions are. If the denotation of an indexical is indeed constructed by both the speaker and the hearer, as Kozyreva suggests, then it is not clear how communication is possible assuming that communication is about transmitting content from one individual to another. The speaker must be able to construct a statement and convey its meaning to the hearer. The author also shows that the problematic cases discussed by Kozyreva in relation to the semantics of indexicals arise in cases without indexicals. The author thus argues that the explored phenomenon is broader than the semantics of indexicals. One example is the present tense in Russian, which is known for not being indexical. However, Russian puzzles that are identical to the ones described by Kozyreva are indexical. The author proposes to discuss the matter in terms of types and tokens of linguistic expressions. He outlines an approach according to which the problematic cases can be dealt with in terms of the familiar Kaplan-style semantics and Gricean pragmatics. The main point in this proposal is that maybe in the problematic cases the person who wrote the note was cooperative and assumed the context of the hearer. That person thus did not make any assertion in their own context of writing the note, but rather constructed a token for the context in which the hearer would be reading it. When the hearer (the recipient of the note) reads it, they assume that the speaker (the author of the note) was cooperative and thus could not construct a token that would be read as a contradiction in their own context. Thus, the hearer reasons, the (temporal) context that was originally assumed for the token is their current context. In more complicated cases, the speaker can reason even further: if the token they are dealing with still does not make sense in their current context, then they assume that the person who constructed the token intended some other more suitable context. The bottom line here is that it remains unclear why the problematic cases cannot be dealt with in terms of extralinguistic pragmatic factors such as manipulation of the contextual parameter that the communicators engage in.

On the eve of his 90th birthday, he is answering questions from colleagues about the history and profession of a historian, the features of the scientific school, the life at the faculty in different historical periods. Zhigalov points out that the most important thing in the university teacher's work is an interaction with students. He reckons that a professional historian should rely solely on documents and facts and considers curiosity to be one of the main incentives in research work. B. S. Zhigalov's reflections are an important indication of the development of the Department of Modern, Contemporary History and International Relations and the Faculty of Historical and Political Sciences in the second half of the 20th early 21st centuries.

AB The article includes a theoretical and practical part. In the theoretical part, an attempt is made to determine the role of patriotism and citizenship in the policy of macroidentity, and the related issues are clarified. A review of the main approaches to the definition of patriotism as a political phenomenon, theoretical models and typologies proposed by Western scientists - recognized experts in this field is made. The practical part describes some of the key parameters of the patriotic and civic self-identification of young people, their relationship with critical and active citizenship. The empirical basis of the study is the data of a questionnaire survey (n = 1,364) of Tyumen youth aged 16 to 30, conducted in November - December 2019. The sample is representative in terms of sex and age (error within 5%), formed by a spontaneous selection of respondents. For statistical data processing, the analysis of contingency tables, as well as cluster analysis (k-means method) was used. Three groups of young people were singled out depending on their patriotic self-identification: identifying themselves as patriots, classifying themselves as patriots only in part, and not considering themselves patriots. The patriotic aspect of self-identification correlates with three groups of citizenship parameters: critical citizenship, responsible citizenship, and active citizenship. Cluster analysis made it possible to classify respondents according to a set of parameters that characterize critical citizenship. Based on this, in groups with different patriotic orientations, two categories of respondents were identified - loyal and critically oriented. The conclusion is made about the intersection of patriotic identity and civic orientations of young people in terms of civic obligations and responsibilities, as well as in relation to formal symbolic behavior demonstrating loyalty to various actors representing the macropolitical community. Attitudes associated with critical citizenship, on the contrary, reduce the degree of young people's identification as patriots. Respondents who do not consider themselves patriots are characterized by an increased level of criticality - they negatively assess the situation with political rights and freedoms in the country, trust the authorities less, but are more interested in the opportunity to influence and control it.

AB In the last quarter of 2021, a number of important events that consolidated the previously outlined trends in China's development took place but with new significant nuances. In early November, the 6th plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee was held in Beijing, at which, in the official interpretation of the Communist Party of China, the "third historic resolution" was adopted. In fact, it formalized Xi Jinping's monopoly on political power on the eve of the 20th CPC Congress scheduled for autumn 2022, at which Xi is planned to be re-elected as the CPC General Secretary for a third term. In mid-November, an online Summit of Xi and Joe Biden took place, confirming the current course of both sides to develop relations with a "new bipolarity in the context of globalization" emerging around the Sino-American confrontation. In December, the white paper titled "China: Democracy That Works" was published in Beijing. In parallel with the increasing intensity and scale of China's propaganda and diplomatic offensive, it revealed a new detail in Beijing's approaches to bipolar confrontation with the United States - namely, the inclusion of the topic of "democracy" and "value orientations" of world development in the sphere of confrontation. New peculiarities have emerged in the economy. At the December economic meeting of the CPC Central Committee, the views of the Chinese leadership on the country's near economic future were presented to the public much more cautiously than before. In Chinese foreign policy propaganda, the role of China's main partner in the fight against American hegemony, through which Beijing seeks to strengthen the "Chinese pole" of the "new bipolarity", is assigned to Russia. In addition to the growing volumes of economic and military cooperation and political interaction, Beijing counts on Moscow's support in matters significant for active Chinese diplomacy in promoting Chinese ideas of democracy and the "Community of Common Destiny for Mankind" theory as the most important universal reference point in the world ideological and political space.

AB In modern reality, the COVID-19 pandemic has radically affected all spheres of public life, including electoral technologies and processes. It also became urgent to review the significance of certain electoral institutions and processes, which by now were already perceived as integral, and their existence was considered unshakable. We are talking, first of all, about election observation. Research by Susan Hyde and Judith Kelly was among the first attempts to systematize and quantify the impact of international observers on the quality of elections. The authors proved that the presence of international observers can reduce the number of violations of electoral legislation, although only on the election day and not in all cases the same. Whether their presence has any long-term consequences has not yet been clearly determined. The starting point for increasing criticism of the role of international surveillance was the election in Kenya in 2017. Questions remain relevant: If election monitoring is limited to short-term effects, is this enough to justify the costs of this practice? Where should observers go, because today not only developing democracies are struggling with uncertainty about the quality of elections? The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the previously emerging crisis phenomena in international election observation: a change in standards from the promotion of democracy to "worldcracy"; the bias of international organizations and the difference in their strategic interests; lagging behind the use of new technologies, including monitoring of social networks; dominance over local observers; and the contradiction of the conclusions of individual election observation missions to court decisions. International election monitoring, in addition to solving the above-mentioned problems, must adapt to the new conditions associated with COVID-19. This adaptation should include the development and active implementation of election observation guidelines during COVID-19. In the long term, the sustainability of election observation depends on the institutional strengthening of observer groups formed by NGOs within countries. International missions need to gradually resort to the wider use of online technologies in election observation. For the full use of the potential of international observers, priority should be given to sending not short-term, but long-term monitoring missions. Follow-up missions between elections are also crucial to ensure the implementation of the observers' recommendations.

AB The article analyzes aspects of the restructuring of the conceptual framework of the Soviet theory of the state based on the principles of Marxism. This reconceptualization was inspired by Stalin. The purpose was to justify the change in the form of the Soviet state: the proclamation of a "state of all the people" instead of a state of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat could not satisfy the interests of the developing Soviet state, and that is why the concept "people" (the nomination of the actual owner of the state and source of power) and the concept "state of all the people" (the nomination of the new form of the Soviet state) was added to the categorical structure of the Marxist-Leninist theory. To perform this task, the original Marxist principles were subjected to serious adjustment, Soviet political discourse was restructured in accordance with the new guidelines. Since the 1930s, Stalin designed a new Soviet statism and consistently strengthened state-centrism, which required the introduction of specific innovations into the state theory. A theoretical revision of the basic Marxist concepts was needed. The concepts of classes (especially the proletariat), of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and of the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat were revisited. In the Soviet political thought, the significance of a number of Marxist concepts increased (classless society, for example). Other Marxist concepts ("classes", "class struggle") lost their meaning. The theory was filled with non-Marxist concepts ("state of all the people", "truly people's democracy", "friendly classes"). The world revolution in rhetoric was pushed into the distant future, and the proletarian party was presented as the party of the whole people. At the same time, the principle of internationalism was not rejected, but reformulated in a new sense - based on the concept of the USSR as the "fatherland of the world proletariat". The decline in the political importance of classes in general (and of the proletariat in particular) can be seen in Stalin's works. Stalin methodically accustomed the Soviet public to ideas about changes in the class structure of Soviet society - very significant changes that called into question the existence of classes in the USSR. New principles and concepts were introduced according to the following scheme: Stalin's inspiration (speeches by Joseph Stalin) - party conceptualization by AUCPB (documents of the party forums) - theoretical design (carried out by scientists and ideologists) - ideological functioning and propaganda support.

AB This article investigates the economic integration of Nigerian migrants living in Moscow. It examines the process of integration of student migrants and other migrants who are participating in the economic landscape in Moscow. It is noteworthy that a significant proportion of Nigerian migrants during the Soviet era were students, while the rest were government representatives. Some of these students suffered both physical and psychological abuses which was contrary to the Soviet's gospel of racial equality. However, after the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, the dynamics of Nigerian migration to post-Soviet Russia changed, but the discrimination against them continued to subsist. To understand the integration of Nigerian migrants within the economic terrain in Moscow, this article builds on the experiences shared by 25 Nigerian migrants who are actively participating in the Russian economy. Building on the experiences of these Nigerian migrants, this research is divided into two parts. The first explores the situations that many Nigerian migrants underwent when they were seeking employment and the practices within their organizations. While the second part of this research examines the stories of 2 Nigerian entrepreneurs in Moscow. Findings from this study reveal some of the contradictions in the Russian laws against the welfare of migrants and further show that African products are getting popular in Russia. Drawing conclusions from in-depth interviews with migrants from Nigeria much is learned about their experiences and how it has shaped their perceptions of their host country. It adds to the understanding of the situations Nigerian migrants are exposed to and how they have been able to strategize their integration mechanisms regarding economic participation in Moscow.

AB The topicality of the research is due to the necessity of analyses of group and individual strategies of adaptation, coexistence and resistance of the traditional communities, including the Old Believers' communities, under the new social reality of 1920s. This period is characterized with fast shift from one economic condition to other, transformation of political, economic and social spheres, and the break of traditional ideas. The research will be enable to significantly adjust the contemporary vision of economic and socio-cultural modernization of national autonomy - the Buryat-Mongolian ASSR.
   The article focuses on the features of interiorization of the Soviet power by the Old Believers with the accent on the problem of adaptation of novelties into everyday life. Based on the published resources and archive materials the article reveals the specificity of the relationships between the Old Believers' communities and authorities. It also shows the reactions of the Old Believers on methods of antireligious agitation and propaganda; provides the analysis of their attitude to modernization projects in education and health care; examines the features of assimilating the novelties in economic, leisure and everyday practices, in marriage and family relations.
   The complicated process of assimilating new social practices and economic relations imposed by the Soviet power in the Buryat-Mongolian ASSR developed gradually because of the late establishment of the Soviet power and ethnocultural and economic features of the region. Firstly, the Old Believers took new power as a force that could adjust local life, but with the growth of antireligious struggle their attitude to atheistic power turned into negative. The authorities started to use administrative levers to influence the Old Believers' communities, and methods of socio-cultural events relating to every sphere of people's life became more and more aggressive, which increased the Old Believers' aversion of the atheistic regime and facilitated the popularity of opposition attitudes.
   The research shows that the more conservative a community is, the harder its members, especially the most orthodox ones, perceive novelties, the stronger they oppose and resist these novelties. The practice of implementing the Soviet modernization projects of the 1920s revealed that the state must take into account the historical, ethnocultural and confessional features of the regions and the peoples inhabiting them when choosing the means and elaborating the mechanisms of reforming the society.

   raznochintsy
AB Ivan Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons made a strong impact on Russian society in the 1860s. Everybody argued about Bazarov and nihilism in Russia. Bazarov became a symbol of the conflict between fathers and children, liberals and radicals. But, besides this, the novel led to a split of Russian radicals into two groups. The first group of radicals recognized Bazarov as a "symbol" of the younger generation. This group was headed by Dmitry Pisarev. The second group recognized Bazarov as a "caricature" of the younger generation. This group was headed by Maxim Antonovich. This article is an attempt to answer the question of why this happened. The article hypothesizes that the conflict between the radicals was caused by the class issue. Dmitry Pisarev and Maxim Antonovich had similar convictions, but had different class interests. Antonovich was the son of a priest, he felt insecure in society. Therefore, he recognized Turgenev's controversial novel as dangerous for the raznochintsy (lit. people of various ranks) class. Pisarev was a nobleman and felt confident in society. Therefore, he saw no threat in Turgenev's novel. After the publication of Fathers and Sons, Antonovich 's fears were confirmed. Many contemporaries began to perceive nihilists as people capable of violence and destruction. When fires broke out in St. Petersburg in 1862, newspapers began to write that nihilists were to blame for the arson. But some time passed, and the attitude of many young people towards Bazarov began to change. New readers of Fathers and Sons discovered many positive traits in Bazarov that they wanted to imitate. They noticed his absolute sincerity, his faith in science. The raznochintsy existed in Russia since the time of Peter I. But earlier the raznochintsy wanted to get an education in order to become nobles. In the middle of the 19th century there appeared such commoners who wanted to be on their own. Turgenev in his novel gave them a visible image of how one can look and behave. And Dmitry Pisarev gave them ideology. He told how one can live and think. And since that time the word "raznochintsy" has disappeared from use. The raznochintsy with ideology began to be called the "intelligentsia".

AB In the article we present the analysis of the perception of six youth political leaders: A.P. Metelev, O.N. Zanko (Amelchenkova), M.V. Voropaeva, Yu.V. Ogloblina, V.M. Vlasov, D.A. Davydov, who come from youth politics and who continue their careers in public administration and public policy, through the methods of political psychology. The objectives of the study are to identify the personal and professional potential of contemporary young politicians, the general mood of young people towards this cohort, and to provide a comprehensive study of the youth political leadership phenomenon in the contemporary Russian context. The conceptual research model is based on the understanding of the image of a politician as a complex mental construct, reflecting the real characteristics of politicians and expectations towards them. Due to the unexplored nature of the phenomenon, the study presents an analysis of a set of parameters: leaders' origin, the potential electorate's attitude to them, and their professional path. The empirical research basis is represented by focused interviews with young people aged 18 to 35 (n = 356) with projective techniques. Based on the empirical data analysis, we revealed some peculiarities of the perception of youth political leaders: the parameters of attractiveness, strength and activity at the rational and unconscious levels of perception are expressed heterogeneously and often do not correlate with each other. The motivational profiles of the politicians are dominated by such motives as "power for ambition" and "power for action", which seems quite justified for professional politicians. Images of the politicians are characterized by ambivalence or uncertainty, even though the study was conducted during the peak of image activity - on the eve of the election to the State Duma and after it. The absence of a direct positive correlation between the respondents' young age and their perception of youth leaders deserves particular attention as well. This is indicated by the respondents' ignorance about their activities and views on the rational level, and by their perception that young politicians are "immature for adult politics" on the unconscious level. Nevertheless, some leaders have indicators of attractiveness, strength and activity, which are favorable for a politician image at the unconscious level of perception. The results of the study suggest that youth leaders have potential in the form of electoral attractiveness. At the same time, perception incongruence on different levels gives reason to speak about the need to work on the formation of youth political leaders' images and their positioning in the public policy space.

AB Many events of the 2020 elections proved to have historical significance for American society. Impeachment to President Trump, Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests, coronavirus pandemics and urgent need to introduce unpopular measures to address the social-economic consequences together with other issues became a "perfect storm" for American political system, challenged the stability of its vertical and horizontal federalist dimensions as well as the foundations of party competitiveness. The author summarizes the implications of the 2020 events on the elections, which took place in November of that year. The vertical federalism was challenged by the conflict between President Trump and a number of congressmen, especially from the Democratic Party. Even though the impeachment didn't remove Trump from the office - the political contradictions were clear. The horizontal federalism was challenged by the implications of the coronavirus pandemics and the urgent necessity to introduce national measures in addressing the issue. Some of unpopular measures had to be enforced by the decision of the Supreme Court. Besides, in many states, the primaries had to be cancelled or delayed. And eventually, the popularity of absentee voting instruments resulted in the victory of Democratic candidates in many states. The foundations of bipartisan ideological competition were challenged by the protest of the BLM movement, on the one hand, and Trumpism, on the other. All of these and other events had implications on the outcome of the presidential, congressional and gubernatorial elections of 2020, some of which were surprising. 2020 had established certain trends which will influence the midterm elections in 2022 and the upcoming elections in 2024.

AB The article analyzes the motives and factors of political engagement/nonengagement of students from the border regions of Siberia and the Far East to predict the development of Russian political practices and assess the prospect of their involvement in the political process. The structuration theory of political action by Anthony Giddens serves as a methodology of the research. The data of the research have been obtained from polls of focus groups of grade 10 and 11 pupils, students of colleges and universities in Altai Krai, Zabaykalsky Krai, Primorsky Krai, Khabarovsky Krai, Omsk Oblast, the Republics of Altai, Tyva, Buryatia (October-November 2021). The polls' conduct after the January protests and the election campaigns of 2021 made it possible to reveal the carefully considered opinions of young people about the motives of their current political behavior, the conditions and factors for the inclusion of young people in public policy. To reach the set goals, the authors analyzed the assessment by young people of the degree of political subjectivity in their social groups, their current attitudes to participation in protest actions, exercising of their active and passive electoral rights, the impact of digitalization, migration attitudes, attitudes to government policy, values and other factors on the choice of strategies and forms of young people's political behavior. The conducted research has revealed the prevalence of skeptical assessments by pupils and students of their political abilities, as well as the association of political actions exclusively with protest movement. At the same time, the authors have observed that the state's response to the protest movement of 2021 led to a reorientation of some young people from unconventional to conventional (elections, signing petitions, etc.) forms of political behavior to protect their interests, as well as to an increase in depoliticization of the youth. The most significant motives of this transformation are, on the one hand, fear and disappointment of young people in the effectiveness of mass politics, and, on the other hand, their desire for change, their pragmatism and interest. Against the background of the positive effect of the political process digitalization, the research shows a decrease in the influence of the value factor, migration attitudes and assessments of Russian policies on the political activeness of young people. The conclusion is made about switching the focus of student attention to ensuring personal comfort and self-fulfillment, and the probability of their return to public policy in the event of serious threats to these, as well as formation of their situational decision-making behavior.

DE environmental protest; protest agendas; social network sites;
   politicization
AB The introduction of social network sites into the life of society has led to the transformation of the old forms of civic engagement and the emergence of the new ones. Due to the unique features of the virtual space: hypertextuality, extraterritoriality, instant feedback, etc., social processes have reached a new stage of their development. Having received the opportunity for unhindered communication, instant response, as well as a certain degree of anonymity, public activists have become, perhaps, the main beneficiaries of the rapid development of online civil society. Online activity has become rightfully considered one of the forms of social participation, first among activists, later among the scientific community and the authorities. It is precisely because of the attention to this phenomenon that recent online activism could not help but be politicized because social network sites have become a convenient platform for sociopolitical communication. A form of this communication is online protest activity - one of the forms of expression of the will of citizens, implemented in the virtual space. Over time, new forms and types of protest actions began to appear on the network, affecting a wide range of unresolved problems. The aggravation of certain topics is primarily due to the specifics of broadcasting information - the main resource of networks. Depending on the volume of information transmitted, the purposes of its use and the degree of dissemination between users, protest campaigns either attracted the attention of the general public or remained local. The totality of such information, the semantic load used in its translation, goals, motives, ideals, etc. are protest agendas. An analysis of the broadcasting of such agendas can show not only the structure of modern online protests, but also about the prevalence of certain unresolved problems. One of such problems in the past few years is damage caused to the environment and the consequences that this damage brings to residents of certain territories. For several years, in a number of protest environmental campaigns, the environmental agenda has been firmly entrenched in the minds of activists. In this regard, the study analyzes the current coverage of protest environmental agendas, determines the degree of support for such agendas. The politicization of environmental agendas in protest campaigns in 2019 and 2020 has been proven.

DE political power; ruling regime; public administration; digitalization;
   citizen; civil society; political culture
AB Modern flows of digitalization in various spheres of life form new configurations of social and business ties between the state and society. In fact, the current level of digital communications initiates a new chronopolitical cycle of global development. However, its specific forms depend on the strategies of the ruling political regimes, within which these processes not only generate new structures and mechanisms of power and public administration, but also resonate in the sphere of culture, in mental constructs and living standards of citizens. In the context of various strategies of the ruling regimes that focus on distancing citizens from the decision-making process, on communication with business or on strengthening national identification models, versions of the cultural evolution of civil society are also significantly modified. Responses and developments in the cultural body of the state and civil society are conditioned by various trends in the use of digital technologies. In turn, the actual political trend of digitalization mainly supports the authorities' desire to take control of those forms of challenging their positions that can provoke a crisis of legitimization, shake the stability of their dominant position. In hybrid regimes and countries of unintended authoritarianism, digital technologies are used to strengthen political and administrative control over citizens' sociopolitical activity and territorial movements, their discursive practices and deliberative arenas. Such forms of reproduction of the main information and political mechanisms of government, as well as the strengthening of control functions in the public sphere and mass discourse, not only preserve the fragmented nature of subcultural communications, but also support the spread of paternalistic and conformist attitudes in society, create advantages for traditionalist and paternalistic values. In Russia, the digitalization of politics preserves the old fractures in the domestic cultural body, maintaining the standards of confrontational discourse and hindering the enrichment of the value experience of a Russian citizen. Preservation of the established political realities in the medium term retains risks for maintaining constructive communications between the state and society, hinders free forms of enrichment and development of civic culture, and the spread of ideals and values of democracy.

   memory and history
ID HISTORY; FUTURE
AB The article analyzes the conceptual apparatus developed in the field of memory studies: the concepts "post-memory", "prosthetic memory", "cultural memory", "transcultural memory". In particular, post-memory refers to memories of events experienced and transmitted by parents to their children, who were not participants in these events, but experience them with the same force. Prosthetic memory is understood as the memory of events which individuals have not personally encountered and which are not related to the events of the national history of their country, which they received through the mass media, but to which they have a certain emotional attitude (namely, a sense of "empathy"). Modern research literature also discusses the question of the so-called "transcultural turn", which is linked with the study of the ways in which various media forms of memory transmission and forms of memory in general can circulate between the borders of nation-states and beyond them and which is reflected in the concept of "transcultural memory". We propose and argue the thesis that the creation and use of such concepts as "post-memory", "prosthetic memory", "transcultural memory", etc. should be interpreted as a symptom of the actualization of the theme of perception and attitude to the past in the mass (public) consciousness in general. We also argue that behind this topic lies a deeper and more painful problem: what does the modern mass consciousness see as the value of the past and how productive is such a vision for modern culture? We argue that the division into communicative and cultural memory, introduced by Jan Assmann, should be considered a turning point in memory studies. Assmann notes that cultural memory is institutional in nature, embodied in symbolic forms (monuments, museums, libraries, archives and other mnemonic institutions), and extending to objects that are temporally removed from the present. Based on the analysis of the idea of cultural memory, we show that the concepts of post-memory, prosthetic, transcultural and transnational memory are introduced and used not so much to expand the concept of memory beyond the traditionally established ideas about it, but rather to expand collective ideas about the past as a whole. We argue that they create the removal of ideas about the past beyond the limits of their own national histories and the formation of a special attitude towards such a past through empathy, moral assessment, compassion, in particular, by including the tragic experience of other cultures in their own. As a result, in discussions about memory, we are increasingly speaking not so much about its role, as we usually imagine it, but about effective tools for influencing the formation of our ideas about the social world as a whole and the past as an immanent part of this world.

DE scenario method; construction; education; theoretical images
AB The article is aimed at the comprehension of the specificity of the scenario approach as a scientific method of building a hypothetical picture of prospective study objects and the demonstration of its applicability to the cognition of education as a social phenomenon. One such image of a possible row is offered for comprehension as the most promising theoretical image of contemporary education designed on the basis of the most pessimistic scenario of its development. We stress that education as an object of study is aggravated with polydisciplinarity and development in the conditions of exclusively high uncertainty and various types of fluctuations. For the solution of the task of designing promising theoretical images of education, we introduce a scenario design - a theoretical and methodological tool that combines constructivist scientific traditions and the scenario method. The scenario design procedure includes the main stages and is based on the author's universal structural unit-construct, namely a "promising theoretical image of a social phenomenon". We implement the trendy scenario designing, and the key trend in our case is digital technologies. The analysis of the promising theoretical image of education designed in the article allows describing the picture of a possible future of contemporary education and formulating recommendations of what education can be like if it develops according to the pessimistic scenario we propose. In conclusion, we note that the concept of reinforcement of the theoretical methodological basis of traditional constructivism with the help of the scenario method tools presented in the article allows "looking behind the horizon" of contemporary education, which is a complex and multi-aspect social phenomenon. Therefore, it gives the opportunity to reevaluate the actions undertaken in contemporary education in order to mitigate the consequences for its possible future.

AB The aim of this article is to identify various factors affecting cooperation between Iran and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), and to determine the prospects for further cooperation. On May 17, 2018, an interim agreement was signed between the EAEU and Iran, leading to the formation of a free trade zone. Cooperation between Iran and the EAEU is developing in three main areas: trade, transport, and energy. The distribution of trade turnover between the EAEU countries and Iran is very uneven, a significant share in it belongs to Russia, and the smallest to Belarus and Kyrgyzstan. Transport projects and energy contracts can become a vector for the development of integration processes between Iran and the EAEU. The development of Iran's relations with the EAEU and China opens up opportunities for connecting the transport corridors of the EAEU to the Chinese One Belt and One Road initiative in the southern direction. It seems possible to divide the process of economic rapprochement between the EAEU and Iran into three stages. The first stage of interaction is characterized by the study of the possibility of creating a free trade zone (FTZ) and identifying the benefits that both parties will receive from signing this agreement. The second stage will require the normative and legal consolidation of the norms and principles of trade and economic cooperation, and the signing of an interim agreement on the establishment of a FTZ. The third stage includes the development of a further action plan and negotiations to conclude a full-fledged agreement on the establishment of a FTZ. In the process of interaction with the EAEU, Iran may face certain problems. Restoration of the US sanctions in 2018, especially on the energy, shipping and financial sectors, has led to a decline in foreign investment and a blow to oil exports. The possibility of termination or suspension of foreign investment in transport projects can significantly affect Iran-EAEU cooperation. By creating and improving the transport and logistics infrastructure, Iran will become a link in the construction of international transport corridors. Further deepening of Iran-EAEU relations, however, will assist both parties to confront regional challenges and threats and to strengthen their security system in the region by establishing a dialogue with neighboring countries.

AB The study presents the results of the multidimensional approach to the social stratification of contemporary Russian society. The proposed model employs the Weberian concept of life chances which has been operationalized on the map of 24 binary items measuring the positive and negative privileges of individuals and their households in four major domains of life, economic stability and security, industrial relations, human development, and economic consumption and leisure. Drawing from the Monitoring data conducted by the Federal Center of Theoretical and Applied Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2015 and 2019, we proposed the posterior model of vertically integrated five socioeconomic classes. These are as follows (2015 and 2018): disadvantaged (lower) non-economic class (23 and 21,8%, correspondingly), disadvantaged (lower) economic class (19,4% and 17,3%), two semi-privileged classes-lower middle class (29,4%. 34,1%) and true middle class (15,8%. 13,4%)-and advantaged (upper middle) class (12,4% and 13,4%). The obtained results reassess the popular view that there are no big classes in industrially advanced societies and highlight the importance of the noneconomic forces of multidimensional stratification of the Russian society in the posttransition era. The results also showed that the disadvantaged economic class demonstrates the highest degree of protest voting. The upper middle class turned out to be the most politically loyal, which saliently contradicts the prevailing stereotypes about the patterns of the political behavior of citizens in the new Russia.

AB The article explores the problems of the development of digital infrastructure of social sciences and humanities in the countries of the European Union. Particular attention is paid to the European Research Infrastructure Consortia (ERICs), as well as to other projects and initiatives in the field of digital social sciences and humanities (SSH). The development of digital infrastructure for these areas of scientific knowledge is one of the political priorities of the European Commission and other EU bodies. Aside from contribution to the effectiveness of the European Research Area (ERA), support of digital SSH indirectly contributes to the strengthening of supranational institutions and European identity. At present, there are grounds to identify the existence of a digital infrastructural basis of the European Knowledge Area. In this regard, the importance of the EU experience for the future development of digital infrastructure in Russia and the EAEU countries is growing. The creation of consortiums of the digital scientific infrastructure within the EAEU and the expansion of opportunities for funding of collaborative research projects are important directions in strengthening integration processes and developing the scientific potential of the post-Soviet countries. In conclusion, the authors emphasize the great importance of the principle of open science, which could be a basis for cooperation between researchers from the EU countries, Russia and other post-Soviet states.

DT Article
DE nomenklatura; Baltic countries; late Stalinism; political repressions;

AB The article analyzes the main qualitative characteristics and features of the leadership and specialists' formation of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in the period of "late Stalinism." The main sources for the article were the archival documents of the thematic cases of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of the Bolsheviks and the materials of the "Survey of executives and specialists as of November 1, 1947" - a unique closed census, the results of which were reported only to the top Soviet leadership. The article analyzes the total number of employees in specific industries, the proportion of the workers of the "indigenous" nationality and the number of managers who came to work to the republics after the end of the war. The latter data are of particular importance, since they made it possible to calculate the proportion of workers in certain industries who lived in the republics during the occupation. Special attention is paid to the management system and political campaigns that exerted direct influence on cadres policy. The analysis carried out by the authors showed that the proportion of leaders and specialists of "indigenous nationalities" did not exceed 85 %, and most often was 50-60 %. At the same time, at the level of uyezds and volosts, the proportion of "indigenous" nationalities increased to 95 %, i.e. at the grassroots level, most of the leaders and professionals were local residents, usually non-members, who had spent the war years under the occupation. Probably, this circumstance caused concern of the central authorities and led to a number of political campaigns in the late 1940s - early 1950s. Only after J.V. Stalin's death did the reform of cadres policy begin; L.P. Beria and N.S. Khrushchev can be considered its authors.

AB The article explores the problem of the evolution of Office of the High Representative (OHR) into executive power of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The author argues that this process is not driven by the peaceful settlement, but is determined by intention of several external powers to integrate BiH into euroatlantic structures regardless of the internal political situation. Peace Implementation Council (PIC), the successor of International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY), empowered the High Representative with the "Bonn powers" thus turning making OHR into a body of external administration, questionable in terms of international law. The Bonn powers were used most intensively during the first decade of existence of post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina, i.e., the mid-2000s. Limited use of the Bonn powers since then is conditioned by rapidly changing situation in the region and international tensions. The rotation of elites and rise to power of Milorad Dodik's cabinet in 2006 in Republika Srpska allowed RS to block the process of centralization in BiH, while Independence referendums in Kosovo and Montenegro were held. RS is supported by the Russian Federation since centralization of BiH presupposes entry not only into the EU, but also into NATO. It explains the concern of Russia over preservation of Dayton's status quo and determines its intention to dismantle supranational structure of governance in BiH. The relevance of the topic is defined by political tensions in Bosnia: during the boycott of the federal-level bodies of state administration by Serbian politicians, Croat and Bosniak representatives adopted anti-Russian resolution. In addition, general elections are scheduled for October 2022. These events make it critical to analyze the evolution of the OHR and its activity.

AB The article examines the circumstances and history of delivery to Russia of ethnographic collections by the First Russian Expedition to Ceylon and India (1914-18). These items were stored at Russian Tea Firm Gubkin & Co warehouses in Colombo, Government Museum (Madras) and Indian Museum (Calcutta), at the State Far Eastern University (Vladivostok) until 1925. The authors consider political conditions and ways of protection of the Academy of Sciences property in the 1920s. The Indian collections in 1921-24 became the pretext for the working out a model of interaction between the young Soviet state and Great Britain. The arguments proposed by Academician F.I. Stcherbatsky made it possible to resolve diplomatic conflicts related to the confiscation of the property of British subjects in the Soviet Russia. In 1923-24 international cooperation of scientists facilitated the transportation of Indian exhibits to the academic Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (MAE). By 1925, most of the collections had been delivered to Petrograd, the Meerwarths returned to the MAE.

AB The problem of missile defense is considered by Russian researchers, first of all, as part of the strategic stability problem in relations between Russia and the United States. At the same time, the impact of regional missile defense (theater missile defense) on the regional security remains largely unexplored. The U.S. and NATO leadership continue to claim that Russia has deployed intermediate-range missiles in the European part of the country. As a response to this step, in addition to other measures of regional deterrence towards Russia, it is planned to strengthen NATO's regional missile defense system. The purpose of the article is to determine the potential impact of enhancing NATO's theater missile defense on regional security. The answer to this question is important for understanding the prospects for European security. The article provides a critical analysis of Western experts' scenarios of actions of Russia and NATO around the Baltic countries, the place and role of theater missile defense in these scenarios, and compares the doctrinal guidelines of the US and Russia regarding regional non-nuclear deterrence. There are situations in which NATO's enhanced regional missile defense could strengthen regional deterrence, and there are situations where this is less likely. Taking into account the doctrinal guidelines of both sides, conclusions are drawn about the destabilizing potential of NATO's regional missile defense enhancement and that, in strengthening regional stability, there is no alternative to arms control and transparency regimes.

DE Republic of Belarus; Belarusian political crisis; Belarusian revolution;
   Alexander Lukashenko; color revolution
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the causes of the Belarusian political crisis and the struggle of A. Lukashenko's regime opponents against the Belarusian authorities in 2020-2021. The paper examines the scientific discussion on the nature and specifics of popular uprisings in Belarus in August-November 2020. The Belarusian authorities used the terms "color revolution" and "mutiny". At the same time, A. Lukashenko gradually came to a conclusion that the main reason for the crisis is the external interference of neighboring countries of the European Union and NATO. The study provides examples of assessments of events in Belarus by foreign researchers. In foreign scientific articles, the leading role of the Russian factor in the Belarusian political crisis is fixed. In Russian political science, the thesis is defended that in 2020, a "color revolution" took place in the Republic of Belarus. The article primarily analyzes the internal socio-economic and political reasons for popular uprisings in the cities of Belarus in August-October 2020. As part of the analysis of the dissatisfaction among the Belarusian population with A. Lukashenko's economic policy, the negative role of the oligarchic capitalism formed in Belarus is noted. Particular attention is paid to the reasons for the developing of the protest potential of Lukashenko's electorate at the beginning of 2020. The study analyzes the political phenomenon of Belarus - the presence of a base (main) electorate. For almost a quarter of a century, the inertia of the political orientation of the base electorate ensured stable support for A. Lukashenko's regime. The article states the fact that the Belarusian authorities, in their populist and demagogic policy regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, failed to assess the catastrophic fall in A. Lukashenko's rating in time. The failure of the Belarusian authorities in the fight against COVID-19 launched the formation of the protest vote against the candidacy of A. Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election. The article analyzes the tactics of street protests and the actions of the Belarusian authorities against their political opponents. The author notes the impasse in the political system of Belarus, the expansion of the public split, and the lack of dialogue between political opponents. Until now, the Belarusian authorities have been able to maintain control over the country, but no real way out of the political crisis has been found. One of the consequences of the crisis was the growing dependence of the political regime on Russia. However, this dependence did not translate into an acceleration of economic integration between the countries. The way out of the political crisis chosen by A. Lukashenko in conducting constitutional reform (the referendum on February 27, 2022) can lead to dual power and end with political destabilization similar to Kazakhstan (January 2022).

AB In recent decades, Russian diplomats and political experts have been constantly discussing the problem of using "soft power" in the conduct of Russian foreign policy in the post-Soviet space. An analysis of the discussions on the problem shows that the practical application of Russian "soft power" runs up, firstly, on a contradictory theoretical understanding of this concept by Russian politicians and experts, and, secondly, on a number of objective difficulties caused by political, socio-economic and cultural features of the post-Soviet space. This article is devoted to the study of the designated complex of problems of the policy of Russian "soft power" in the post-Soviet space on the example of the states of the South Caucasus. It is characteristic that even the resource-instrumentalist policy of "soft power" that Russia pursued in the post-Soviet space had a number of serious shortcomings - the segmentation of resources that were not united by a single system of political values, and the lack of coordination between the leading institutions conducting it. These shortcomings are exacerbated by the constraints that have created the political, economic and cultural characteristics of the post-Soviet states for Russian "soft power". In the South Caucasus, the main limitation in relation to Georgia was the lack of any "trust" between the two states and societies. With regard to Azerba.an, a serious constraint for Russian "soft power" is the tight control of the Azerba.ani authorities over the country's social and political life. In Armenia one can see a significant economic and military-political presence of Russia, but there is no systematic work on the issues of pairing Russian resources of "attractiveness" with the specific interests of this country.

DT Article
DE Marxist ethics; A; Bogdanov; L; Aksel'rod; A; Lunacharsky; Class
   morality; Ideological forms; Universalist ethics; Inconsistency of
   Marxist ethics
AB At the beginning of the twentieth century, Russian Marxism, which was rapidly gaining intellectual and political influence, faced the need to develop its ethical concepts, since the "atheistic ethics," represented by the philosophy of Russian narodniki and European social democrats, were found to be ideologically unacceptable. The subject of this article is an attempt to comprehend the moral problems addressed in the heterogeneous circles of Russian Marxism in the first three decades of the twentieth century. The concepts introduced by A. Bogdanov, L. Aksel'rod, and A. Lunacharsky played a critical role in this context. If Bogdanov proclaimed historical legality and morality as such to be forms of ideological consciousness that would be abolished in the course of social evolution, then Aksel'rod sought to defend and justify a universalist understanding of morality, faced with the need to reconcile this understanding with the key provisions of historical materialism. Lunacharsky, finally, found himself in an equally difficult situation, trying to reconcile the position of the self-sufficiency of the Marxist worldview with the obvious, as it seemed to him, need for its "ethical supplement" and finding a solution in peculiar identification of the ethical and the aesthetic. These attempts reflect a peculiarity of the development of Russian Marxism. In the field of ethics, in particular, it followed a path that could be described as one of narrowing interpretations, as a result of which a more heuristically simple and unambiguous version of the theory was created.

DE ethnopolitical conflict; ethnic and national identity; nationalism;

AB The authors of the article have tasked themselves with demonstrating that ethnopolitical conflicts always have a significant emotional component, which lies in cultural stereotypes, unmet (imaginary and real) expectations, historical grievances, parties' mythologized ideas about each other, etc. In turn, the rejection of any dissent by the conflict parties determines a dualistic view of the world, which demonstrates the division into absolute good and absolute evil, and leads to a tough confrontation between the carriers of the "highest truth" with those who prevent its implementation. The authors emphasize that it is due to this excessive emotional component actualized by the demands of ethnic identity that ethnopolitical conflicts are characterized by a high degree of irrationality, expressed in a huge potential for aggressiveness and hostility, far beyond the rational awareness of the interests of the conflict parties, and the choice of a strategy for interaction and search for a compromise. A particularly rapid escalation of conflict occurs when an ethnic group tends to perceive itself as a "victim" of value claims on the part of "alien" groups. However, the authors believe that it is impossible to reduce the ethnopolitical conflict solely to the affective behavior of its participants. Long-term use of violence is a social process; therefore, it cannot be based only on strong emotions, but, on the contrary, has to presuppose the development of certain norms, sanctions, roles, etc. That is, violence must be rationalized, explained and channeled. Therefore, the authors emphasize the crucial role of "ethnic entrepreneurs" in the escalation of ethnopolitical conflicts. Their activity can be viewed as a "production of ideological conflicts", i.e., as a deliberate indoctrination of ordinary conflict participants in order to strengthen ethnic solidarity and/or armed struggle as a means of "national liberation" and achievement of other goals that are significant to ethnic entrepreneurs. Consequently, since emotions cannot be completely separated from rational thinking, the nature of most ethnopolitical conflicts depends both on subjective factors and on objective structural elements. Thus, all of them, combining rational and emotional activities, in one proportion or another, produce three types of conflicts: the struggle for resources, the clash of interests, the emotional upholding of ethnocultural identity.

DE term; notion; concept; terminological triangle; terminological planning
   theories; interdisciplinary approach
AB The problem of the definition of a term in the theories of terminological planning based on the application of an interdisciplinary approach is investigated. The aim of the study is to demonstrate the possibility of constructing philosophical foundations for the formation of a unified approach to the issue of defining and understanding a term in the absence of such in the theories of terminological planning. The article is based on an interdisciplinary methodology that includes three components: socio-philosophical, sociolinguistic, and semantic approaches. The socio-philosophical approach allows one to integrate existing approaches based on social priorities (society is the main actor in terminological activity). The sociolinguistic approach helps to demonstrate the connection between social and linguistic processes, which manifests itself directly in terminology. The semantic approach allows one to demonstrate the process of forming the meaning of a term, on the interpretation of which the understanding and definition of the term largely depends. The notions "term", "notion", "concept" are related to each other on the basis of a number of philosophical approaches. The non-identity of these concepts with each other in the semantic sense, as well as the impossibility of defining a term without these concepts, is demonstrated. Based on this, the author proposes for comparison a model of a terminological triangle (concept-term-concept) as a criterion for assessing the status of a term and its functions in different theories of terminological planning. Each member of the terminological triangle has a dominant function. The notion is assigned a semantic function in terminological activity (the establishment and consolidation of meanings in a language), the concept performs a cognitive function (the relationship of meanings to each other in the knowledge system), the term fulfills a communicative function (the relationship of meanings and knowledge). At the same time, the author notes that members of the terminological triangle can perform other functions depending on social priorities. Based on the terminological triangle model, the status of the term in three theories of terminological planning is analyzed (General Theory of Terminology, GTT), Communication Theory of Terminology (CTT) - Theory of the Doors (TD), and Sociocognitive Theory of Terminology (STT)). The author shows that the status of the term does not fully coincide either in the designated theories, or in comparison with the functions of the term in the model of the terminological triangle. The author proves that the status of the term depends on social needs, solved with the help of theories of terminological planning, and states that the presence of a terminological triangle model can be the first step towards building a general model of a term based on interdisciplinary methodology.

DE socio-scientific progress; trading zones; mission of science; humanism;
   culture
AB The present article provides a critical reflection and answer to the ideas articulated in Ilya T. Kasavin's book Science - A Humanistic Project (2020). It attempts to define what must be named a humanistic science and what the mission of science is in the current world. The mission of science is not separated from its functions in society, and actually from the unique conditions of knowledge production. As Kasavin presupposes, the sciences of humans produce social technologies. Science is connected with humanism via the ethics of science and the epistemology of virtues, which introduce the regulating principles into routine practice. This kind of vision can be augmented by a thesis about the decisive role of humanitarian ideas in the renovation of culture, concerning the foundational significance of humanitarian projections for programming social codes and influence on events and people. The division between inner and outer trading zones allows conceptualizing traits of collective construction of meanings inside humanitarian laboratories or within research units intentionally designed for scholars in human sciences. Humanitarian laboratories change historically like it is so with Galison's trading zones for the case of natural sciences. They evolved from informal scientific communities, social clubs and literary salons to contemporary analytical centers and intellectual thinktanks. Human science laboratories have always formed outer trading zones and built firm bridges between theory and practice, between scholars and other social actors. Moreover, society itself must be compared with an experimental playground for testing ideas and theories, where through the sieve of experience they prove own viability and resilience. Non-reducibility of the social context of science reveals its humanistic essence. Humanistic science absorbs the potential acquired by humanity for meeting new global challenges. Thus, it requires the improvement of human living conditions and aims to resolve urgent social problems. Rejoining with the new education and new enlightenment, humanistic science shapes human worldview overcoming existential barriers and turning minds to creativity instead of destruction.

DE The October Revolution; systemic crisis; civil war; social
   transformations; global development
AB The question of the historic role and importance of the October Revolution of 1917 is still a subject of both political and ideological discussions and debates within the academic community. The questions of the historical results of the 20th century for Russia, as well as of the specifics, consequences and prospects of the modernization process in our country are inseparably linked to the question of importance of the 1917 Revolution. According to the authors of the article, today we need systemic reflection of the causes and consequences of the October Revolution of 1917 with regard to internal dynamics and contradictions in the Russian political, social and economic systems, and of the revolution as a special way of resolving these contradictions. The 1917 Revolution was a result of the large-scale systemic crisis of Russian society, economy and politics, the preconditions for which had developed by the beginning of the last century, as well as of the failed attempt of modernization "from above" which had been implemented by the authorities of the Russian Empire since the last third of the 19th century. The lack of systemic solutions to the peasant, national and workers "issues" had become a catalytic factor for the revolutionary process in Russia which fundamentally changed the structure and character of Russian society. The Russian revolution had become an attempt of a "modernization leap" to reduce the gap with the leading countries of the world and an attempt to implement the strategy of "alternative modernity" in relation to the capitalist West, which for several decades was an example for a large number of societies and countries that had chosen a non-capitalist path of development. At the same time, the development potential which was created as a result of such a "leap" was not fully realized in the second half of the 20th century despite a number of significant political, social and economic successes of our country which managed to maintain its sovereign status and the prospect of independent state and political development due to a mobilization scenario and large-scale sacrifices. Ultimately, the defeat of the USSR in the Cold War despite the enormous tension of forces meant a failed attempt to implement its declared alternative to the capitalist path of development. Based on the results of addressing the stated problem, the authors of the article conclude that the potential of such a type of modernization that was implemented by Russia in the 20th century was fully realized, and that our country needs to return to the path of consensual and qualitative evolution which will require an in-depth rethinking of experience of both recent national history and its preceding periods.

DE consciousness; collapse of wave function; quantum mechanics; decoherence
AB The Copenhagen interpretation gives rise to the problem of the collapse of the wave function, since, in accordance with the linearity of the equations of quantum mechanics, measurement procedures should not destroy the multiplicity of states describing alternative versions of measurement results. If we reject the collapse of the wave function, but maintain the multiplicity of superposed states, claiming that each of them is carried out in a separate classical world, then we become supporters of the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics. This view assumes the proliferation of the conscious subject, which contradicts the essence of consciousness that is not subject to duplication due to its subjective nature and its inherent private knowledge. The Copenhagen and Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics is opposed by the theory of decoherence, which allows us to explain the transition of quantum existence to the classical one without using the physically incorrect concept of the collapse of the wave function. However, the theory of decoherence does not completely solve the problem of the quantum world acquiring classical features that are found in the perception of a conscious subject. This suggests a subjective-idealistic conclusion (shared by such leading scientists as Werner Heisenberg, Johm von Neumann, Eugene Wigner, Roger Penrose, Michael B. Mensky) that the reason for the collapse of the superposition of possible states is mental in nature and therefore does not find an adequate place in the physical picture of the world. Quantum-physical experiments conducted over the past few decades (for example, an experiment conducted by a group of scientists from the University of Vienna led by Anton Zeilinger) refute this ontological position and prove that the collapse of the wave function is caused not by observational knowledge, but by the natural presence or artificial production of the necessary amount of information, which ensures the transition from possible existence to reality due to the redistribution of probabilities associated with the state of the physical system. Thus, it is possible not to abandon the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and keep the phenomenon of wave function collapse (instead of replacing it entirely by the phenomenon of decoherence, whereby the world finds the classic features, but is not yet actually classic) if to understand the collapse of the wave function as the objectively existing process of informational nature. This process does not adequately fit into the physical picture of the world without taking into account the information components of material existence and thus causes misunderstandings and paradoxes that force us to attribute to consciousness the role of a link between the quantum world and the classical one.

DE Quentin Meillassoux; Graham Harman; object-oriented ontology;
   speculative materialism; contemporary ontology
AB The article analyzes the ontological ideas of Graham Harman and Quentin Meillassoux. The author establishes that Harman's object-oriented ontology defends the principle of horizontality, while Meillassoux's philosophy is anthropocentric and therefore hierarchical. The concepts of the non-human are defined in both approaches. Harman's universe, consisting of objects of equal ontological status, is analyzed. The principle according to which new objects appear in the world is explicated. The theory of accident in the interpretations of Meillassoux and Harman is investigated. The Meillassoux contingency is fulfilled by the principle of identity, while, for Harman, accident has the property of inconsistency. Further, the relation of these concepts to the themes of classical ontology is investigated. It turns out that the thesis of the identity of being and thinking is defended by Meillassoux and is criticized by Harman. Meillassoux believes that he succeeds in substantiating the absolute subjective cognizability of the non-human world and, consequently, in restoring the principle of identity. Object-oriented ontology (OOO) sees in identity a return to the ontological hierarchy and anthropocentrism. Meillassoux also claims that the denial of the principle of sufficient reason allows him to create a non-metaphysical ontology. On the contrary, Harman defends this principle, and, moreover, makes it "infinite". The author also establishes that OOO is skeptical about the ideas of ontological knowledge and truth, while Meillassoux acts as an optimist in this regard. For Meillassoux, direct ontological cognition is possible by appealing to reason and mathematics; in turn, Harman allows only indirect cognition, and entirely in the form of aesthetics. Both approaches agree that the universe cannot have, firstly, a finite number of elements and, secondly, one element that would unite all the others. The author argues that the concepts of Harman and Meillassoux seek to include the sphere of the non-human in contemporary ontology as a theme that has always been mainly on the periphery of European thought. In addition, Meillassoux wants to restore respect for rationality and exact sciences to continental philosophy, while the Harman approach promises to expand the field of ontological work. The author concludes that, against the background of the named advantages and points of contact, it is worth striving for the synthesis of these ontologies.

DT Article
DE Caius Antonius Hybrida; cursus honorum; Late Roman Republic
AB The paper addresses core issues of C. Antonius Hybrida's political career up to the socalled Catilinarian conspiracy. The analysis leads to the following conclusions: Antonius' career success was largely due to his descent as well as to his connections with Sulla and with high-ranking Sullans. The Sullan past had no negative impact on his career, and his failures can be explained by objective reasons rather than by the hostility of any group to him personally. During the proscriptions, Antonius might have been buying up the property of the proscribed, but more likely was not involved in the murders. The exchange of provinces between him and Cicero was most probably initiated by the latter in order to secure Antonius' neutrality during the discussion of Rullus' agrarian proposal. After that Hybrida was not bound to maintain neutrality, and if he ever hurt the optimates' interests defended by Cicero, it was due to his family ties or the search for personal gain.

DE Vyacheslav Kamburov; Maksim Kovalevsky; Pitirim Sorokin; Ferdinand
   Tonnies; Geschichte der Sozialwissenschaften
AB German archives contain a letter from Vyacheslav G. Kamburov (1874-1906), a privat-docent of Kiev University, then a professor of Tomsk University, to Ferdinand TOnnies (1955-1936), the patriarch of German sociology and social philosopher, a major expert in the ideological heritage of the English social philosopher and theorist of state power Thomas Hobbes, with an enclosed business card of Maksim M. Kovalevsky (1851-1916), a Russian sociologist, historian, lawyer and public figure. The study of the circumstances of this written address reveals unknown fragments of contacts between the scientists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These fragments have historical and scientific significance, for they essentially complement in essence Kovalevsky's memoirs, as well as the memoirs of his research secretary, the sociologist Pitirim Sorokin (1889-1968). Kovalevsky and Tonnies met personally at the first congress of the International Institute of Sociology (1 to 9 September 1894). Tonnies praised Kovalevsky's report on the collapse of traditional social relations in the Russian society. They also talked about Tonnies's studies of Hobbes's legal doctrine. Knowing TOnnies personally, Kovalevsky supported Kamburov's written appeal to the German philosopher for scientific advice. Kamburov's letter of 17 February1903 came from Paris (where Kamburov met Kovalevsky, who was lecturing at the Russian Higher School of Social Sciences (19001905) at the time). The comparison of the major research questions posed in the letter, the content of Kamburov's introductory university lecture (1900), his subsequent book on Hobbes (1906), and Tonnies's essay on Hobbes (1894) confirms that Kamburov used Tonnies's recommendations on the questions. This circumstance contributed to Kamburov' formation as one of the major experts in the philosophical and legal doctrine of Hobbes in Russia. The published letter also testifies to the gradual strengthening of ties between Russian and German social sciences at the beginning of the twentieth century, which was changing the orientation in sociology to the teachings of its founders, Comte and Spencer.

DE death penalty; punishment; justice
AB For various reasons, the topic of the death penalty has not been a subject of active interest in Russian science over the past two decades. Dissertation studies were conducted exclusively in the legal discourse and belonged to the period of the late 1990s - early 2000s. The article presents an overview of these studies. The aspects touched upon by many authors (the approach to the death penalty from the perspective of a criminal-legal institution; the statement that the termination of the use of the death penalty in Russia is connected with the accession of the Russian Federation to the Council of Europe; the alternative to the death penalty in the form of life imprisonment) are identified. Works with special objects and subjects of research (the concept of "terminal punishment", issues of punishment in pre-revolutionary dissertations) are noted. Some shortcomings, which are common in a number of dissertations (inconsistency of approaches and research methods to the set aim and objectives, conjuncture, politicization) are presented. The dubiousness of arguments often used in the dispute about the death penalty, which are in the field of statistics and sociology, is shown. It has been revealed that the gap in the available dissertations is, at least, the issue of protecting the rights of crime victims: it is practically not touched upon in the legal sense, or in other aspects. Dissertations related to the philosophical understanding of the issue of the death penalty and submitted for defense in the post-Soviet period have not been found. Due to the reference to studies of historical character and works of philosophers of law, the limitedness of the criminal-law approach is shown, which leads to the loss of the sociopsychological and historical essence of the death penalty; consideration of these aspects allows believing that the legal possibility of the death penalty for particularly grave crimes against life must exist.

DE Vatican; foreign policy; Africa; "soft" power; interfaith dialogue
AB The article is devoted to identifying the role of the Vatican in the formation of the Catholic space within the African continent. A century ago, the focus of the Vatican's policy was primarily on the problems of Europe, since most of the adherents of Catholicism were concentrated in this part of the world. However, at the beginning of the 21st century, about 70% of Catholics lived in the developing countries of Latin America, Africa and Asia. The spatial transformation of the Catholic world was caused, on the one hand, by a wide diffusion of the secularization in the European countries and a drop in their population birth rate; on the other - by the success of Catholic missionaries in developing countries combined with the high birth rate characteristic of their population. In this regard, the attention of the Vatican, starting from the second half of the 20th century, began to increasingly focus on the countries of the Global South - including African countries, although Catholicism is not the dominant religion on the Black Continent. The regional policy of the Roman Catholic Church in Africa is mostly characterized by the geography of papal visits to the countries of the continent, which have become one of the most effective means of political influence of the Vatican. The basis of the Holy See's policy towards African states at the present stage is to ensure the functioning of the structures of the Catholic Church, protect its freedom and independence, strengthen its influence among the existing flock and attract new adherents. Among the most important activities of the Vatican in Africa are humanitarian issues: the establishment and maintenance of peace, social justice and respect for human rights. Not less important direction of the Vatican policy in Africa is the strengthening of the Islamic- Catholic dialogue, which is based on the discussion and solution of the following issues: problems of freedom of conscience and religion; the political situation in the Middle East and North Africa in the context of functioning of the Christian communities and Christian shrines in these regions; problems associated with the migration of Muslims to European countries and the provision of assistance to refugees; religious and legal issues caused by the growth of Muslim communities in European countries; opposition to religious fanaticism and fundamentalism. At the same time, it is too early to speak of a clear positive shift in solving the political and socio-economic problems of Africa. Thousands of Africans set off to seek a better life in developed countries, which creates serious problems and contradictions for the Vatican, as emigration contributes to the weakening of Catholicism on the continent.

DE Far East of the USSR; SRBFEA; military personnel; peasant moods;
   summaries; the political department; collectivization; dekulakization;
   peasants; the poor; middle peasants; the kulaks; collective farm
AB Active and thorough study of the collectivization of the agriculture and the dekulakization in the USSR started only two decades ago. But social and psychological factor, which is connected with the reaction of the country's population to the government policy in agriculture in early 1930s, has not been described in historical literature yet. Many SRBFEA officers and soldiers descended from peasant families, and their reaction was ambiguous and depended on different political and ideological and social and economic aspects of country life. The purpose of the article is to examine and analyze quotations as one of the most important forms of reactions of the military staff and their relatives to the Soviet government's policy in collectivization of agriculture and dekulakization in the USSR in early 1930s. The quotations can be found in archives most of which are introduced into the science for the first time. To this end it is especially important to reveal the reasons why these or those reactions emerged and developed, to analyze their character and constituents, as they influenced the all-Union judgements of the population regarding the state policy.
   Soldiers of the Red Army who served in the Far East of the USSR came from villages and were of different social and economic levels of peasantry. Some of them were positive about the government actions because they were motivated by the expectations of the future socially fair society with equal rights for every citizen, and by the hope on significant material aid of the state in development of collective farms. Approval shown by some of the peasants was determined by the fact that in spite of the hard conditions of agricultural production in most of the regions collective labour was more productive, especially in the conditions of decreased male population after the First World War and the Civil War. The part of the peasantry who for some reasons could not or would not improve their social and economic situation hoped to limit the influence of the rural bourgeoisie in the country.
   Critical and negative reaction came from the SRBFEA soldiers and their relatives who had economically strong and prosperous peasant farms and were able to adapt to the new conditions of life during the Soviet years. As a rule, they relied only on themselves in increasing of labour productivity. Since late 1920s the collectivization policy damaged individual farms and caused natural negative reaction of the kulaks and the economically strong middle peasants. Under-standing the threat of such reaction the government of the country treated these people as politically unreliable and made them change their places of residence while their property was passed on to the collective farms. This information was transferred to the SRBFEA divisions by mail and orally where it became the subject of many discussions and the reason of different reactions.

DE Darwinism; racial hygiene; degeneracy; racism
ID SWEDEN
AB The article aims to examine the scientific philosophical and ideological foundation of eugenics which had the status of applied science and a form of social movement in Western Europe and the United States in the late 19th - first half of the 20th centuries. I prove that evolutionism was the key scientific philosophical element of the foundation, primarily in its Darwinian version, interpreted in the context of metaphysical naturalism. Accordingly, the main ideological element was racism in its biological and social forms. Darwinism led to racism through the related ideas and views which also underpinned eugenics. I speak primarily about the radical biologization of a human being and the culture he or she created that flowed from Darwinism and strengthened it in turn. Although neither this nor any other version of evolutionary theory required such reductionism, they were closely interconnected. Other views of this kind included: (a) the insecurity of progress, which meant the possibility of a rollback towards the animal past; (b) the idea of an "anthropological stairs" which connected the lowest (anthropoid ape) and the highest (white educated inhabitant of Western civilization) points and was used to establish the measure of evolutionary development of a race, nation, class and individual; (c) the "scarce mentality" theorized by Thomas Malthus and well-responded by the spirit of developing capitalism, colonial expansion, and Protestant ethics; it painted the world as a field of incessant struggle for limited resources. The outlined complex of mythogenic views was part of the impending degeneration myth. I argue that the threat of far-fetched degeneration was the main engine of the eugenic movement. According to that myth, any highly civilized nation was to perish or degrade in a not too distant future if its biological life was allowed to take its course in the absence of large-scale measures to improve it. In conclusion, the "image" of eugenics as well as modes and forms of its presence in modern life and culture are discussed.

A number of authors support such ideas of the book as the defining role of informal communication in science, metaphysical origins of scientific solidarity and ethos, the embedding of the migration archetype in the scientific vocation, the prospects of science as a social agent, and the non-classical understanding of humanism. The article explicates and summarizes certain objections proposed by the opponents, according to which the book sets out a normative-utopian concept of science, exaggerating the influence of metaphysics on scientific activity, idealizing the solidarity of the scientific community and the moral qualities of scientists. The response to opponents explains the ideas of the book, formulates additional arguments in favor of their consistency, and also provides counter-arguments against a number of critical remarks.

DE logic of world; formal logic; Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus; ontology
AB The article criticizes the thesis that formal logic has no ontological value and does not play a prominent role in Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. The author of the article reconstructs the ontology of the Tractatus in order to show that formal logic is the representation of the structure of the world. The main attention is paid to the concept of sense and the distinction between two types of nonsense - sinnlos and unsinnig propositions. The author proves that the senselessness of propositions of logic, tautologies and contradictions, does not lead to the idea that formal logic does not have ontological value at all. Indeed, according to Wittgenstein, formal logic does not represent any reality (neither physical reality nor the reality of logical objects), but it plays a fundamentally important role in explicating the structural properties of language and in showing the internal relation between language and the world. Logical symbolism makes it possible to clarify and emphasize the relations between the objects within the sentence and the relations between the sentences themselves, which determines how the world can be given to us and what kind of image of the world we are able to form. This clarification does not characterize and does not affect the sense of sentences, but allows us to make it obvious in each specific case, since the structural properties of the language are revealed in formal logic in an explicit form. In tautologies and contradictions, the conditions for the correspondence of the picture that are provided by a proposition and the reality are annulled, but their connection with the representative function of language is still clearly traced, unlike those sentences of language for which the truth-finding procedure is generally impossible, namely for unsinnig propositions. Formal logic does not provide any particular picture of the world, but it marks the limits of description, defining the structural possibilities of proposition in general, and hence knowledge in general. Having no ontological content of its own, formal logic, from Wittgenstein's point of view, determines the formal possibilities of constructing any specific ontology, and in this sense it has meta-ontological value.

   "two truths"; conceptual world; accidents; Porretani; non-difference
AB The article analyzes the relationship of continuity that was formed in solving the problem of universals in the era of antiquity and the era of early scholasticism. The author shows that the 12th century became the time of renewed interest in the designated problem due to the fact that it was an era of cultural renaissance. The latter is considered as a transitional era, which is always characterized by the "closure of experience" (S.S. Neretina's term) - of any experience - to the individual. Roman classics and Greek philosophy in the 12th century were assimilated by the Latin Christianized culture; the culture of the Muslim world became the means of this assimilation - this is the context in which the interest in the problem of universals revived in the 12th century. In the field of education, philosophy and logic came to priority positions by the end of the Middle Ages, which also contributed to the revival of interest in the logical and theological side of the debate about universals. Universals are presented as ambiguous (the construct "equivocation" in Boethius's terminology): equivocative - ambiguous (as divine ideas that conclude the act of creation and exist in the status of common names of things, including concepts). The concepts of realism - nominalism - conceptualism are separated. Conceptualism is based on the idea of the possibility of revealing the universal through the special, by means of referring to the concrete ("fused being"). The author substantiates the thesis that the incompleteness of the debate about the universals of Hilbert and Abelard is due to Hilbert's position regarding relations. The relation itself is the ability to be one of the two terms of the relation: the relation is intrinsically inherent in the substance, since its essence is to enter into a series of relations. By linking relation to substance, Hilbert gives infinity to the debate with Abelard. In Abelard's interpretation, the true meaning of objects of nature is inexpressible through language; judgments about the invisible are in the competence of faith. Universals have the status of being in intellectual cognition, but this is a conceptual world. Hilbert and Abelard disagree on the question of how the categories of the individual and property, subject and predicate, genus and species are represented ontologically; however, the two are united in the scholastic idea that, distinguished by logic, these categories are rooted not only in language, but also in reality: knowledge created through judgments that have a subject-predicate structure is true if the connection of terms in the judgment reproduces the ratio of the parts designated by them. As shown in the study, the dominant premise that theological and philosophical thought brought the problem of universals back to life in the 12th century was, in the author's opinion, the following: it was during this period that the style of thinking was formed and was able to be applied in the analysis (as a way of reasoning and evidence), characteristic of the era of early scholasticism. Friedrich Engels drew attention to this feature when he wrote that the history of the Middle Ages knew only one ideology - religion and theology. Taken in conjunction with the scholastic ideal of knowledge of the era of early scholasticism, the indicated style of thinking provided interest in the problem of universals.

DE ethics of science; semantics; statements; Wittgenstein; Merton
AB In the light of Wittgenstein's analytic studies, discussion of the theory of the ethos of science by Merton allows achieving the goal of clarifying the grounds for argumentation of statements about the ideals of scientists' behavior and communication. The author complements Richardson's comparison of developments in the sociology of knowledge and the philosophy of science. As a basic methodology, the approach gives grounds for revealing possibilities of sociological knowledge in regard to the description of the ethos of science and its components, such as universalism, "communism" (or "communitarianism" as an orientation for the common goods), disinterestedness, and organized skepticism. In general, it is possible to clarify the generalized ethos of science as a topic of study. This clarification involves the intersection of scientific divisions with the points of the inevitable departure of norms of behavior in scientific community beyond the scope of a purely scientific description. It becomes possible to regulate the cognitive process, which is based on criticism of existing types of scientific behavior and communication. Cognitive process reveals the foundations of social relations at mutual suppression of scientific and extra-scientific types of rationality. As a result, the research shows the ideals that a scientist should follow in order to be a successful researcher and to keep the possibility of harmonizing his/her own behavior and the expectations of the world around. In an epistemological perspective, analysis of the boundaries of the normative definition of strategies of behavior and communication in science becomes fundamentally important. This analysis guarantees independence from the danger of becoming very dependent on the extra-science components of the mentioned normativity, which is inevitably allocated in practical implementation.

AB The paper examines the myth of science as the basis of the new European civilization project, its main components and impact on the modern technogenic era. The authors demonstrate how, by transforming over time and adapting to various social circumstances, the myth of science retains its archetypal features, while remaining a purely humanistic project. The development of modern civilization is closely related to science and scientific progress. Actually, science, as a mathematized experimental knowledge, in many respects turned out to be a product of the new European civilization project. But what lies at the basis of the myth of science? The readiness of a scientist to unselfishly seek the truth and give it to others is the most important feature of this attitude. At the same time, this gift involves a critical attitude towards oneself. Criticism and constant doubt are a direct continuation of the myth of science. This is what makes it possible for scientists to strive to find something new, create original ideas and concepts, and transform the world. Expanding our understanding of the world, they create new realities and travel in them. As a result, the myth of science includes three components: gift, criticism, and migration. Since the middle of the 19th century, it has become quite obvious that only movement along the path of scientific and technological progress can make it possible to respond to the challenges of the spread of European empires outside Europe. The underlying values of science, which initially appeared in Europe, have gone beyond the science's limits and have been accepted by other cultures. Using the metaphors of the "myth of science", we can say that it is in this interaction that migrant-travelers bring their "gift" in the form of knowledge to the common table and find mutual understanding during the "critical" discussion. This is the coordination of different cultures, which now not only oppose each other, but also find a common language. Of course, in this case, the interacting scientists have a common background, which is associated with the simple fact that during their professional socialization they mastered and assimilated a common scientific ethos, got acquainted with scientific methodology, and strove to become scientists. By doing this, they can find a common language. Now science acts as a special cultural background for various states and cultural societies. Turning to scientific knowledge, the values of science, they can look for ways for mutual understanding and forging a dialogue. The dialogue unites different cultures and makes it possible to form a new technogenic civilization, which can be permeated with humanistic ideas of recognition of the importance of humans and humanity, dialogue and mutual understanding.

AB The article is a review of a book about robberies and treasures of the Lower Volga region written by a prominent pre-revolutionary researcher, a member of the Saratov Scientific Archival Commission Alexander Nikolaevich Minkh and published by Saratov historians-archivists. Two copies of the manuscript of this book are stored in the funds of the archival repositories of Saratov and St. Petersburg. It is noted that the publication is a landmark event for Russian historiography, special historical disciplines, ethnography and national local history. The materials of the reviewed book, rich in factual information and author's reasoning, allow us to take a fresh look at the cultural world of the Lower Volga region, which has long been an important region of our country. Its centuries-old military-administrative and economic colonization, viewed through the prism of numerous folk legends and robbery epic, makes it possible to see the history and culture of the Volga region in the context of common ways of historical, cultural and political development of Russia. The review corrects the few factual errors made by the author of the book, misspelling of the names of various historical characters and some other inaccuracies. In addition, there is a scientific debate on controversial issues of historical science. Among the topics discussed are the role of the Old Believers in the emergence of the Pugachev rebellion; the authorship of one of the most famous foreign sources on the history of the Moscow riots of the early XVII century; the role of the Don Cossacks in unleashing and spreading imposture, and many others. The opinion is expressed that a number of author's misconceptions are explained by the level of development of historical science in the second half of the XIX - early XX centuries. It is noted that the book by A.N. Minkh is a genuine encyclopedia of folk legends about robbers, their hidden treasures and their search, as well as a monument to the historical thought of his time. The archeographic work of Saratov archivists in cooperation with historians of Saratov State University on preparation and publishing of a fundamental scientific work of famous pre-revolutionary scientist and public figure is positively evaluated. The article concludes about the relevance of the peer-reviewed scientific work and its undoubtedful value for modern Russian scientists.

AB Introduction. The strengthening of Russia's subjectivity in the Black Sea region makes it the center of the Western media and expert-analytical agenda. The authors of the study aim to define the mechanisms of metaphorical construction of the Black Sea region as a space of conflict in the discourse of the Western think tanks.
   Materials and Methods. The reports of the leading Western think tanks developing the region concept are used as research materials. The methodological basis of the study is a systematic approach that combines the methods of political linguistics and geopolitical analysis and synthesis. The authors use the methods of discourse analysis to interpret the materials of foreign think tanks devoted to the study of the region, and based on the definition of dominant metaphorical models in the discourse of the Black Sea region, consider possible scenarios for the leading actors in the region.
   Results. The narratives of the leading American, European and British think tanks are considered and the main metaphorical models characterizing the geopolitical processes in the region are highlighted. The American discourse is dominated by the sports metaphor and its subspecies associated with gambling: the region is perceived as a space of competition, but not war, as evidenced by the lack of military metaphor, which, however, appears in the narratives of the European experts. The Black Sea region is a platform, a springboard for the projection of Russian power in the Mediterranean, which is realized through metaphors with the component "aggressive". For the British, the Black Sea region is metaphorized as a space of information warfare.
   Discussion and Conclusion. There are two main types of perception of the Black Sea region as a geopolitical unit by the Western think tanks: the American think tanks see it as a space of global competition of the great powers; the Great Britain has made the Black Sea region a platform for a return to the global arena of Global Britain by drawing on the rhetoric of universal values. The materials of the article and the methodology may be useful for information and analytical support of the foreign policy of the Western countries and for design of response from part of Russia under the condition of intensification of contest of the main Black Sea region actors.

AB Key topics in scholarly publications of Soviet and Russian economists in the 1950-1980s, during the periods of Perestroika, radical economic reforms of the 1990s, the economic growth of the 2000s, the 2009 global crisis and economic stagnation of the second half of the 2010s are identified and compared by content analyzing full texts of books and journal articles. Namely, all articles published in Voprosy Ekonomiki from 1989 to 2021 are analyzed. It is shown that the departure from the paradigm of Marxian political economy leaves the question about a new paradigm open. Using the Google Books corpus, the everyday economic discourse in Russian is compared with that in English and French. It appears that the Russian everyday discourse is relatively less adapted to discussion of economic issues.

AB The aim of the article is to identify the influence of metamodernism on modern philosophical concepts of culture, aesthetic ideas of modernity, embodied in specific cultural phenomena. The problem of the research is the need for a philosophical understanding of the phenomenon of metamodernism, which is due to the influence of aesthetic and ethical attitudes of metamodernism on the sociocultural reality. In the theory and philosophy of culture, as well as in social philosophy, there are discussions about the devaluation and loss of relevance of postmodern discourse and its replacement by postpostmodernist theories. Among the pleiad of postmodern theories, metamodernism is the most prominent and discussed in Russian social-humanitarian knowledge and cultural practice, which is due to its popularity beyond the boundaries of theoretical academic discourse. The article identifies the interrelated attitudes of metamodemism: oscillation, postirony, historicity, affect, depth, identity, authenticity, new sincerity, neo-romanticism, superhybridism. Their influence on the modern theory and philosophy of culture, as well as on artistic culture is determined. The system of metamodemism attitudes is tested in the analysis of works of culture. The most obvious realization of metamodemism program can be observed in narrative works: films, literary texts, performances, installations, theatrical productions, a series of paintings or photographs. The viewer performs oscillation when observing a work extended in time and space. Oscillation is an alternating immersion into different states and experiences of different affects. The article identifies and describes the relationship between metamodemist and postmodemist cultural discourses.

DT Article
DE Russia; NATO; UK; information operations; political communication;

AB The article examines the definition of NATO information operations and specifics of their conduct pertaining to certain examples, including those against the Russian Federation. The scientific relevance of the chosen research topic is due to its insufficient study in political science in view of the novelty of the chosen issues. The purpose of this study is to analyze the features of NATO information operations as well as their main international consequences with special regard to issues associated with Russia. This policy analysis is achievable through the application of an interdisciplinary approach to highlighting the various stages of defining NATO information operations through historical, political and psychological analysis of the distinct aspects of such operations. The theory of information operations is based on the works of the classics of political communication, such as G.D. Lasswell and B. McNair, who discussed in detail the tactics of manipulation and propaganda, as well as P. Lazarsfeld and R.K. Merton, C.E. Merriam, T.V. Adorno, and G. Marcuse, whose research is concerned with explaining the spread of ideas through various media in order to influence the mass consciousness within a collective social entity. Among the Russian authors, it is worth noting the works of M. M. Lebedeva on the stereotypes of mass consciousness in the conditions of international conflicts. The research of T. V. Evgen'eva can be used as a basic guide to the interpretation of modern information operations. To support their standpoint, the author provides detailed analysis of how information operations can be defined and divided into stages. The analysis is entwined with vivid examples of information operations conduct, particularly, amid NATO humanitarian interventions, the Sergey Skripal attack, the HMS Defender incident and diminishing the USSR's role in WWII. The author concludes that the deterioration of diplomatic relations is provoked by an overall imperception of the information operations' definition and the clear laws governing NATO information operations, though some space for activating Russia-NATO cooperation still exists.

AB The article examines attempts to use computers for improving the quality of state economic plan-ning in the USSR in the 1960s-1970s. The initial design of the computer network was subjected to repeated adjustments until it began to be implemented as the Automated System of Planned Calcu-lations of the State Planning Committee of the USSR. The whole process can be divided into stages, which differ both in the nature of the work and in the nature of the prevailing rhetoric about the place of computers in economic management. Based on archival documents, I identify limitations that the developers of the automated system had to consider: the weakness of the hardware and software base, the distrust of the "old" planners, problems of algorithmizing the process of national planning, and the need to enter into political alliances with various ministries and departments. However, with all the forced adjustments to the project, the target image of the future system remained unchanged: a unified and nationwide one, covering all economic ministries and departments. It is concluded that the prevailing point of view on the causes of computerization problems needs to be corrected: the slippage was caused not by the Soviet bureaucracy's opposition to the very idea of computerization of planning, but by technical and organizational problems that had clearly emerged by the end of the 1960s-in particular, the desire of participants to interpret the idea in the most favorable light for themselves and lead the process of its implementation. The main obstacle to the computerization of public administration, therefore, was the lack of command in the command economy of the USSR.

AB Mass protest movements of the early 2010s, particularly the Occupy movement, stimulated the rise of radical left organizations globally. In Southern Europe, radical left parties celebrated their first electoral successes. In Russia, radical left organizations were also influenced by this upsurge of social protest movements and participated in the Bolotnaya protests in 2011-2012 but were marginalized and disintegrated shortly after, resuming their activities only by 2019. This article explores the radical left movements and groups in Russia and offers projections for their future. The Russian radical left is divided into three sub-groups: fundamentalist communists who identify with Stalin and the Soviet Union, libertarian socialists and communists (subdivided into neo-anarchists, autonomists, and neo-Trotskyists), and hybrid organizations (e.g., the Left Front). These organizations face two major constraints unknown to their Western counterparts. First, Russia's authoritarian regime blocks opportunities for independent, particularly electoral, politics. This reveals itself in targeted repressions against left radicals and anarchists. Second, the dominance of the CPRF blocks any potential of strong left opposition. Unless these restrictions are lifted, radical left organizations in Russia will not be able to overcome their current crisis.

DE Christophe Bouton; tree of possibilities; temporality; freedom; person
AB The problem of time is the leading topic of contemporary discussions between representatives of different branches of science and philosophy. Christophe Bouton designs a practical approach to the study of the nature of time and aspires to overcome the opposition of objective time to subjective time in the general context of natural science and humanities research. He considers time not only as a person's experience, but also as the basis of their real action in the world, which means that time becomes a condition for the realization of the possibilities that a person opens up in reality. Bouton assigns the concept of the "tree of possibilities", which expresses the relationship between time and human freedom in people's temporal existence, a central place in the temporal problematic. Revealing the meaning of this concept, he analyzes the connection of the concepts "man", "freedom", "time", "temporality", "possibility", "future". A person is constricted by the limits of time in their existence, and therefore it is pointless for them to hope for freedom in eternity. But only by giving up illusions about freedom, a person can really become free. Freedom is manifested in a person's ability to act for the sake of realizing the possibilities this person created. Moving from experiencing possibilities to realizing them, a person can repeatedly modify their temporality. It leads to the destruction of the habitual way of being for a person and their idea of a predetermined future. The future becomes unforeseeable but the true meaning of the temporalization of freedom can only be understood in it. Time does not create or restrict human freedom, but freedom generates its own form of temporality characterized by a variety of possibilities embodied in reality and clearing up the future. Bouton analyzes the philosophical concepts of time and identifies different models of the tree of possibilities, which reflect the character, way of thinking, and actions of a person. Different modalities of temporal existence intersect in the interaction of people. When people share their experiences of designing, realizing possibilities or giving them up, they expand or restrict others' trees of possibilities. Bouton's practical approach sets us not only for an active search for and realization of our own possibilities but also for expansion of possibilities for other people. This is the new image of humanism of the contemporary epoch.

AB The authors analyze the network public associations in Southwest Siberia, their goals, tasks, structure, forms, resource and development potential to assess their state. The methodological basis of the research is the theory of network society by Manuel Castells. The empirical basis of the research is the results of social media and instant messengers monitoring, as well as an expert survey of the studied communities' leaders and moderators. The authors identified 82 urban and regional communities during the studied regions' monitoring (Altai Krai, Novosibirsk Oblast, Kemerovo Oblast, and Tomsk Oblast); these communities' activity is related to solving important social problems. There were 15 experts from the four indicated regions participating in the expert survey conducted from May to June 2021. The results show that the main problem areas of the studied associations are: hail suppression and urban planning, ecology and nature protection, patriotism and civic education. The research demonstrates that self-organizing communities are actively forming, especially in the last four years, using the Internet and social media to attract new participants. Associations use both traditional and online forms, which complement each other, to conduct their activities and coordinate their supporters. According to the level of organization and the presence of a governing body, civic associations are divided into four levels, but mostly they are voluntary self-organizations of citizens. Most civic initiatives do not have sustainable and permanent funding, they carry out their activities through grants and their supporters' resources. They form numerous connections with other civic groups and non-profit organizations. Despite the non-political nature of their activities, the listed communities interact with local government structures, using their support in solving many local problems. The majority of experts are confident in the increase in the relevance of the problems of the studied communities and, as a consequence, in the expansion of civic participation forecasting the dynamics of the civic association's self-organization.

AB The article deals with the problem of self-understanding of a person as a subject of cognition and transformation of the world, responsible for the fate of civilization, raised by Ilya T. Kasavin in his monograph Science - A Humanistic Project. In the conditions of an avalanche-like increase in the rate of changes in the natural and social environment, the question of the historical role of scientific rationality and its commensurability with the ideas of humanism is becoming more acute. Scientific and technical transformation of the world leads to a "future shock" (Alvin Toffler), which is incompatible with scientific objectivity in understanding and assessing what is happening. In a situation where we are permanently in the zone of avalanche-like changes, we have no chance to take the position of an external observer or a post-factum researcher. The existential experience of the "future shock" cannot be an alternative to scientific knowledge, since it does not have positive intersubjective validity. In this context, Kasavin's project of expanding the boundaries of rational comprehension of the ongoing changes by addressing "unscientific" forms of cognition, such as myth and archetypes, is discussed. The concept of the "myth of science" proposed by Kasavin is considered. The myth is interpreted as a total form of life in which practical concreteness and its symbolic expression are fused together. The myth thus understood is neither a delusion nor an irrational experience. On the contrary, it represents the basis of rational thinking, the temporally primary and transcendentally universal way of our historical self-understanding. The appeal to the myth is defined as a paradox. Modern science, which studies movement and change, is unable to incorporate radical ontological and epistemological transformations into its system of concepts. In contrast to this, archetypes, being primary, extremely stable, timeless forms of cognition, make it possible to include global complication and the phenomenon of "future shock" in the body of intersubjective knowledge. This paradox is partly resolved through its amplification. It is shown that science eliminates movement and change, reducing them to the unchanging timeless laws of nature. "Eternal" archetypes, on the contrary, are infinitely tolerant with respect to the movement of time and the dynamics of historical processes.

AB The problem underlying the study is the fact that the approaches used to increase the involvement of representatives of generations prior to generation Z in the practice of philanthropy turn out to be ineffective when involving zoomers, as they do not fit into the system of worldview practices and value orientations of Generation Z representatives. The study aims to analyze the problems and prospects for the development of approaches used to involve Generation Z representatives in philanthropy and develop recommendations for improving the technologies for involving zoomers in philanthropy based on the analysis of their value orientations. To reach the aim of the study, the author (a) analyzed the currently existing scientific studies (including empirical ones) on the specifics of Generation Z's value system and its correlation with philanthropic practices; (b) systematized the acquired knowledge and assessed how reasonable the distinction in value systems between Generation Z and its predecessors is from the standpoint of philanthropic practices. In practical terms, the author (1) explored the involvement of Generation Z's representatives in philanthropy; (2) on the basis of the obtained data and their analysis, determined the features of the influence of Generation Z's value system on involving zoomers in philanthropy; (3) developed recommendations to improve the involvement of zoomers in philanthropy.

DE science; politics; expert examination; methodological naturalization;

AB The author defends the thesis that the implementation of science as a humanistic project in the modern world is associated with the expansion of the political influence of science. This participation, on the one hand, is determined by the special role of scientific experts, and, on the other hand, by the functioning of science as a model in the knowledge distribution system. The concrete implementation of this participation is determined by a wide range of involvement of science in social communication - from education and popularization of scientific knowledge to participation in expert support. This article focuses on understanding the trend towards naturalization in the epistemology of social sciences and no-platforming discussions as a result of the influence of the sociopolitical mission of scientists on research methodology and principles of academic communication. Thus, the methodological trend towards naturalism in social sciences is largely determined by the stereotypes of politicians about what exactly a credible scientific explanation of human nature should look like. These stereotypes are formed on the basis of simplified ideas about the image of natural science knowledge. This shift is largely associated with the technocratic imperative in politics, which suggests that the trend towards naturalization of social and scientific knowledge will only grow. The second part of the article focuses on a discussion about whether to provide a university platform for people spreading "wrong" or even "disgusting" opinions on the subject (so-called no-platforming discussions). The arguments of defenders and critics of the idea of no-platforming are evaluated. Based on the example of gender studies, the author infers that no-platforming may be motivated not so much by the scientific unfoundedness of skeptics' judgments as by the negative influence of "non-constructive dissent" on the legitimacy of civic activism. The author concludes that social sciences in the modern world do not at all seek to distance themselves from the current political agenda, actively participating both in the expertise and in supporting civic activism. This circumstance indicates that it is politicization that embodies the idea of science as a humanistic project today.

AB The paper combines several research logics and strategies. First of all, the thesis about forming the mental and ideological foundations of the information and communication paradigm in the modern public consciousness is justified. This research matrix has acquired an original ideological and epistemological status in the conceptual space of those social philosophic and sociological theories that contain the reflection of qualitative transformations in societal practices and structures of producing social knowledge under the conditions of informatization. According to the authors, the current "post-political agenda" (deontologization being desacralization and profanization of the political) is based on information failures and overloads in political communication systems. The de-hierarchical plural environment of Internet communications provokes the proliferation of information flows, generates quasi-events and toxic information flows, filling gaps in public relations morphology with political phantasms and simulacra. As the analysis shows, the exponential growth of information does not have a positive correlation among the acts of effective interpretation. The amount of information, including social-and-political, is really becoming larger and larger while there are fewer ways and forms of its decryption. The long-term trend and a natural result of the mediatization and virtualization of public policy consists in its "simulacrization". The profile of "simulation representation" and the politician's authority and popularity level are mutually interfaced. The "virtual social capital", reified in the quantitative parameters of watchability, readability and recitation, becomes a universal measure and a criterion of the social significance of all active actors in political life. The general devaluation and profanization of the political axiosphere, its deliberate declarativeness and fundamental irrelevance to the current post-democratic trends in politics, economics and public life, as it seems, provoke and aggravate further fragmentation and disintegration in the systems of social interaction and communication. The author's position is revealed in a number of theoretical propositions regarding the impossibility of reducing any generally significant (universal) bases in the construction of authentic images of social reality in the information and communication paradigm.

AB The article is concentrated on the phenomenon of Indian and South Asian migration to the countries of Western Europe. Initially, migration flows from this region were an inalienable part of metropolis-colonies interrelationship and were sustained on the notion of free and unrestricted movement of human resources from South Asia to the British Isles. After the dissolution of the British Empire and gaining independence, the inhabitants of India and South Asia, in search for a "happier life" overseas, set their course for the United Kingdom and Western Europe, where later migrants were put under rigorous political control. However, the flows of those seeking economic prosperity and political asylum remained intensive and became subject to methodical social regulations in Western Europe. Equilibrium of this kind was put to a severe test when the migration crisis of 2015 and 2016 broke out. Only the most advanced groups of migrants could adjust themselves to the newly emerged reality as demonstrated by the cases of the Netherlands and Italy. The Dutch government has restricted the inflow of low-skilled labour, while encouraging skilled immigration. Indian labour force is generally employed in IT, consultancy, engineering or management. Local and national governments work together with private partners to make the lives of these newcomers easier. High-skilled migrants are welcome as new citizens. Most Indians in Italy have settled in the north of the country and work in agriculture. Indians are considered industrious, business-minded, hard-working and law-abiding. The Indian migrant community has integrated successfully into Italian economic and social life. The author argues that the Dutch and Italian practice of handling the Indian migrants could be critically absorbed in Russia that is keen to attract the "demographic dividend" from outside.

AB The article presents an analysis of the political consciousness and value orientations of Russian students on the example of several regions characterized by high levels of multi-ethnicity in the context of growing threats and risks of new acute conflicts. Approaches to developing the predictions and scenarios of regional development and the detection of the causes of the polarization of values in the social space of a multi-ethnic society are examined. Conflict potential diagnostics are defined by the authors based on the analysis of the socially determined attitudes of ethnic and demographic groups to reality, which shape the real sphere of the public multi-ethnic space and reflect the regional specifics, as well as the main trends of political processes under the influence of globalization. It is emphasized that in the conditions of the new challenges and threats brought about by the global pandemic, which has aggravated many social problems, the demand for conflictological diagnostics rises, and youth and ethnopolitical issues of scientific research focus on an axiological agenda related to the identification of the reasons behind the polarization of values in the socio-cultural and political-economic space.

AB The publications of the members of the Aristotelian Society in Mind from 1896 to 1899 became one of the reasons for the promotion of the authors of the society to the forefront of philosophical research of British philosophy in the twentieth century. The article shows one of the discussions of the Aristotelian Society between Bernard Bosanquet, Shadworth Hodgson, and George Edward Moore, published in Mind in 1897 on the issue of the reality/unreality of time. For Bosanquet, time is not a way of existence of reality but a way of perceiving it. According to him, this allows us to preserve the universality of truth. Hodgson states that time exists as an essential elements of experience, being common to both consciousness and reality. He introduces a conscious being of an indefinitely great power to show that the idea of reality can only be obtained from experience. For this powerful consciousness, the past and the future would exist as part of the present reality. Moore expresses doubts about the argument of a perfect conscious being. He considers that time has no reality because for this being time would be perceived as the eternal present. This objection is considered in the aspect of the development of Hodgson's ideas in phenomenology.

AB Biological safety is one of the most important components of the overall security system of both individual states and the entire world community. Today it has become quite obvious that the problems of biosafety are more urgent than ever and require the maximum attention of the world community. Against the background of the emergence and spread of diseases caused, as a rule, by dangerous and especially dangerous microorganisms, a number of problems arise in the world not only in the field of health care, but also of a political, social and economic nature. A striking example of this is the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic that has continued since the end of 2019. The issues related to biosafety in the agricultural sector and ecology are considered. It is obvious that constant monitoring and analysis of a wide range of biosafety problems, early development of measures to minimize the threats of exposure to already known dangerous pathogens not only on human health, but also on the environment, agricultural and food sectors are necessary. The issues related to the development of new research directions that can lead to the creation of biological systems with specified properties and functions that have no analogues in nature are discussed. In research aimed at the development of new biological technologies, to one degree or another related to the production of biological warfare, the primary and mandatory requirement is to ensure the safety of all personnel involved in these works and the availability of well-trained qualified scientists, as well as certified laboratory facilities in which these works are carried out. It is important to constantly pursue the purposeful development of multilateral international cooperation in the field of biosafety, and make creative decisions to ensure it on the territory of the Russian Federation. The importance of Russia's active international participation in solving existing and potential biological threats within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) and the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) is noted.

AB In the early XVII century, when the New England colonies were established, the English Crown, preoccupied with domestic matters, interfered little with matters of colonial administration. The government system created by the colonists, was inspired to a certain degree by the religious ideas shared by many Puritan colonists but was shaped by political necessity and social conditions specific to the colonies. This created a system characterized by a much higher degree of accountability than in England, ensured by numerous checks on government power, both formal and informal. The same principles, initially applied to governance in individual settlements were later used for the colonies and the Confederation of New England, the first major inter-colonial political union. Early New England serves as an example of practical application of ideas in many ways similar to (and in many ways drastically different from) what we today call democracy as a foundation of ultimately successful government. By modern standards, the representative nature of the New England government was very limited, since it excluded women, Native Americans and other marginalized groups from the political process. It was also deeply rooted in a specific set of religious ideas. Nevertheless, the principles of elected representative government, present in some form in many Western polities, rarely served as a foundation of those political systems, still in most cases monarchies with limited government accountability. In New England these principles formed the core of the government system. This essay explores the formation of the early New England political system, its underlying ideas, both religious and secular, the way it faced some of the challenges encountered in the first decades of English settlement in the New World, and its eventual dissolution under external pressure.

AB The article analyses the interaction between the COVID-19 pandemic and social inequality in the United States, taking the state of Maine as a case study. The pandemic has revealed the effects of high economic inequality on public health in the United States, where in comparison to most developed capitalist democracies, the health care system is expensive, inefficient, and highly skewed in quality and accessibility. Likewise, for industries that were already losing jobs, the pandemic has accelerated a painful transition and intensified the harsh social and economic consequences of high and rising inequality, especially for low-wage workers. The case of Maine underscores the point that policies aimed at reducing the disparities in the distribution of income, health care, education, and opportunity will reduce inequality, protect public health, and stimulate economic growth.

AB This article analyzes the origins and essence of the social ideal of the early-twentieth-century Russian liberal-centrists. We note the leading role played by a number of their most prominent representatives who determined the direction of the oldest liberal publications in Russia (the journal Vestnik Evropy and the newspaper Russkie Vedomosti) in shaping the unique quality of Russian liberalism, in forming the "core" of general liberal ideas about the future (beginning in the 1860s). The author establishes that the patriarchs of liberal centrism in the post-reform decades laid the foundations of the "new liberalism" in Russia and argues that it was the liberal-centrists who played the role of "custodians of the foundations" of Russian liberalism in the early twentieth century. The article describes the differences in the sociopolitical position defended by the liberal "center" ideologists and by the party-organizational and strategic-tactical views of the Cadets and the Octobrists. It emphasizes the significance of the psychological and moral-ethical standpoints of the liberal-centrists in the process of their political self-determination. The author shows the innovative character of ideas put forward by the representatives of the "centrist" wing of early-twentieth-century Russian liberalism. Those innovations are especially obvious in the field of party-building, and in the essential contribution to the development of education and to the development of church and religious issues as one of the key concerns in the process of reform. The author draws conclusions about the demand for the liberal-centrist social ideal both in the early twentieth century and in the present day.

AB This article analyzes the features of the intellectual and cultural environment in which the ideas of late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century liberalism developed. Based on the assumption of liberalism as the "major ideology" created by the Enlightenment and, in that sense, a doctrine designed to "work" in any social and historical conditions, the author describes Russian liberalism as distinctive phenomenon. The purpose of this article is to explore the relationship between the unique and the universal principles in Russian liberal philosophy and sociopolitical thought of this era. The article focuses on the influence that transformation of ideas and cultural life in turn-of-the-century Russia had on the representatives of liberalism: the then-urgent crisis of ideals at that time and the desire to identify new vectors for social development, radicalization of sentiments and reform projects, and so forth. The author also notes the reciprocal influence of ideas on the sociopolitical process. One of the key focuses of this article is the conceptual ideas of Orthodox renewal with the possibility of an ultimate synthesis of Christian and liberal ideas. This study should produce a fairly complete picture of the cultural and spiritual background of liberal thought in Russia at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

AB Using material from contemporary scholarly debate, the author shows that the term "early Russian liberalism" remains conceptually vague both in content and in its chronological sense. In the strictly conceptual approach, the beginnings of liberalism correlate with its doctrinal form, which corresponds to the liberalism of the mid-nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. There is no unanimity in modern historiography on the question of criteria for liberalism, but there is an understanding that the simple imposition of Western models is methodologically wrong, since it would ignore a national specificity for which the main feature is the integration of the liberal worldview with the principle of autocracy. This article considers early Russian liberalism in the chronological sense as a response to the challenges of the time. The historically conditioned diversity of liberal forms allows us to demonstrate the complexity and ambiguity of Russian liberalism as a phenomenon and its syncretic nature. Early liberal ideas were generated among the upper nobility as a means of protecting them from the tyranny of those in power. The main obstacle to the development of political-legal discourse in Russia was paternalism. Alexander I's encouragement of a liberal agenda contributed to the temporary liberalization of the political system but did not change the essence of the legal situation. Nicholas I's usurpation of the political discourse began the process of marginalizing political liberalism's ideas and led to the transformation of liberal discourse into an essentially latent liberal one and a formally ethical one, which prevented full implementation of a liberal agenda.

AB The article analyzes the factors of the military and political integration of Russia and Belarus, taking into account the conditions of the external environment. The authors show the correlation of theoretical and conceptual attitudes in the field of security of the national and integration levels, discursive practices and efforts undertaken by the member nations of the Union State against the background of increasing challenges and threats. The European vector is emphasized as a risky one for both nations and the Union State as a whole at the present stage. On the basis of a comparative analysis of the approaches and practices of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus within the framework of the Union State the authors distinguish the most perspective areas of union construction and key points of contacts. First of all, it seems highly likely that the relationship between the military and political and economic spheres of bilateral integration will be strengthened through the application of new integration tools. Foreign policy support is required for measures to ensure Allied security. The conclusion is made about the stimulating effect of the Belarusian crisis in 2020 on the restart of the Russian-Belarusian integration. At the present stage, the drivers of its deepening in the military-political sphere are manifested, due to the radicalization of the positions of Euro-Atlantic actors, the tightening of their confrontational behavior.

AB The paper attempts at providing a comparative analysis of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Muscovy during their genesis and early development. Kievan Rus, the predecessor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Muscovy, was not a single political entity; it developed from chiefdoms to city-states that were, in essence, obshchinas (communities). This makes it all the more interesting to understand why the societies with the same roots evolved to become so different. Obviously, what comes to mind is the idea of external influences experienced by various parts of Kievan Rus while the new states were being formed, but the extent and the character of those influences can be understood through comparing these states. Comparing them reveals that they initially shared considerable similarity. It may even be said that there was a common model of state formation in the 13th to 15th centuries. For the purposes of this paper it is labelled a military-service state. It is this quite archaic polity that was the start -ing point in the progress towards the estates-based state. The paradox of the region is that before either the Grand Duchy of Lithuania or Muscovy could transform into an estates-based state, they both underwent drastic changes: the former became part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, essentially a province within it, while the latter was plunged into Ivan the Terrible's bloody "revolution from the top, which acceler-ated the formation of the unique Russian state system based on serfdom.

AB The article outlines the transformation of the role and powers of the Ninth European Parliament over the past 2,5 years. It is highlighted that the tendency to strengthen the role and influence of the European Parliament in the political system of the EU, which was laid down in the Lisbon Treaty, has significantly increased. These changes were mostly observed in such areas as drafting and approval of the EU budget, including the long-term one, economic policy, relations with the European Commission and the European Council, including lawmaking and control over the activities of the executive branch, and international relations. The author argues that this process is not a linear and is often accompanied by temporary setbacks, as it happened, for example, with the principle of the Lead candidate. It is revealed that the positions of the leading European parties: conservatives and Social Democrats constantly weakens, the representation of other parties, including Eurosceptic and populist ones, is expanding. Conclusion is drawn that the tendency of the political influence reduction of the European parties is going to remain.

TI The 1867 All-Russian Exhibition - a new stage in the development of

DE new stage of science; history of creation of exhibition; Southern and
   Western Slavs; ethnographic museum; Ethnographic Department of Imperial
   Society of Devotees of Natural Science; Anthropology and Ethnography
AB In historiography dedicated to the First All-Russian Ethnographic Exhibition of 1867, the emphasis is usually placed on its political goals - the demonstration of the imperial ambitions of Russia rallying the foreign Slavic peoples around it. The aim of this article is to show that the primary principles of the exhibition were scientific tasks: the creation of the Dashkovo Ethnographic Museum at the Rumyantsev and Public Museums in Moscow and the Ethnographic Department of the Imperial Society of Devotees of Natural Science, Anthropology and Ethnography at Moscow University. These two events marked a new stage in the development of ethnographic science in Russia. After the exhibition ended, ethnology loudly proclaimed itself an independent science. The author relies mainly on archival sources and literature of the second half of the 19th century, using a systematic analysis of sources related to various issues raised at the exhibition. The comparative-historical method is also used, which made it possible to show the place and role of the exhibition in the structure of Russian science in the last decades of the nineteenth century, in the context of the historical, social and ideological situation in Russia and foreign Slavic countries. The author shows that the exhibition raised important problems of further expanding the comparative study of history, everyday life and customs, religion, economic development of the peoples of Russia, the Southern and Western Slavs, and expanding cultural interaction with them. The purpose of the exhibition was to stimulate interest in the study of the material and spiritual culture of different peoples, and for this it was necessary to make the exposition detailed, visual and reliable. The article discusses in detail the stages of preparation and holding of the exhibition and its results. For the first time, the author analyzes a large exposition of Western and Southern Slavs: Czechs, Slovaks, Croats, Slovenes, Poles, Serbs, Montenegrins, Macedonians, and Bulgarians; describes in detail scenery scenes (Russian fair, Slovenian wedding), which attracted the greatest attention of visitors. The author highlights the huge contribution to the preparation and holding of the exhibition of initiators and organizers: A.P. Bogdanov, V.A. Dashkova, N.A. Popova, M.F. Raevsky and others, and also shows the role in the organization of the exhibition of famous figures of the national revival of the Slavic countries: M. Mayar, B. Petranovich, J. Milutinovich, N. Ducic and other fighters for the freedom and independence of their peoples, who were at that time under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. The Dashkovo Ethnographic Museum was founded on the basis of the exhibits collected in different regions of Russia and in the countries where Southern and Western Slavs lived. The exhibition contributed to the founding in 1868 of the Ethnographic Department of the Imperial Society of Devotees of Natural Science, Anthropology and Ethnography at Moscow University. These events marked a new stage in the development of ethnography, anthropology, and Slavic studies.

AB The circumstances that led to the entry of Soviet troops into Afghanistan are analyzed, and the international and domestic political situation in Afghanistan after the coup d'etat and the announcement by the new authorities of the course towards building socialism, as well as contradictions between the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) factions, are examined. The development of the combat actions of the Soviet troops is studied, and the difficulties that the military had to face in the conditions of resistance from a significant part of the country's population are considered. The support of the actions of the troops by official Soviet propaganda, including hushing up real losses, is considered in detail. Of considerable interest are data on an ideological confrontation: attempts by the Western allies of the Mujahideen to influence the Soviet military contingent.

TI In expectation of intervention: The image of the Entente countries and

   Russia in November 1917 - August 1918
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

   periodicals; Siberia; Far East; Civil War in Russia
AB Under the conditions of society's movement towards a civil war at the end of 1917 - the first half of 1918, the images of "Others" (allies or opponents) acted as meaningful elements of the constructed identities of its potential participants and influenced the ideas they put forward. An analysis of the formation of the image of the UK, France, Japan and the USA in the non-Soviet periodical press of the East of Russia in the period from the end of 1917 to the summer of 1918 reveals the peculiarities of the foreign policy context's influence on public sentiment and the content of propaganda discourses of political opponents of the Bolsheviks. The aim of this work is to determine the content of the image of the Allies, constructed in the periodical press of the East of Russia, and to identify its influence on the ideological aspect of the formation of the anti-Bolshevik movement at this stage. The main source for the study were non-Soviet newspapers and magazines - party, cooperative and private publications published in the Urals, Siberia and the Far East in the period from November 1917 until August 1918. The author comes to the conclusion that the image of the Entente countries and the United States, which was formed in the non-Bolshevik periodical press of the East of Russia at that time, was distinguished by the duality of content. The change in value judgments, which were elements of this image, depended on a number of factors - the incoming information about the policies of the allied countries and the course of the World War, the perception of the external and internal political actions of the Bolsheviks, the peculiarities of the functioning of the information field itself. According to socialists (Social Democrats and Socialist-Revolutionaries), the "imperialistic" Entente and the United States were no longer allies and helpers of Russia, which was sometimes expressed in the using of the term "former allies". The analysis of the vicissitudes of international relations from the point of view of the class approach seriously forced the Siberian "revolutionary democracy" to fear an invasion from the East, which undoubtedly promoted to the formation of an opinion about the allies as a threat in the relevant publications. Liberals, in particular, the publications of constructive democrats, did not agree with their opponents from the left and viewed allies more as a potential helper, although they expressed concerns about the consequences of a possible intervention. At the same time, the key value-based attitude of the anti-Bolshevik forces was also being formed - the necessity of rallying society and creating a firm government capable of starting the revival of the country. Both socialists and liberals persistently sought to root in the minds of readers the idea that the unity of the whole society around the Constituent Assembly would create a new government - more effective than the Soviet one, thereby ensuring peace and avoiding the intervention of the Entente and the United States.

AB This article contains a polemic with conclusions by B.N. Mironov. The author points out that the 1920s forced the authorities in the USSR to use the external signs of the federal structure to establish control over the national margins of the former Russian Empire. Federalism, in her opinion, was a lateral and induced branch of the party goal. During the 1920s, many national leaders who had previously collaborated with the Soviet government were replaced, killed, or exiled. A monopolistic organization of power, reliance on the administrative levers of control, a strict hierarchy of the political elite, and the ideologization of the political system as a whole were established in the country.

AB This article researches not a big, but an important period in the modern history of Russia, which became a transitional stage from a socialist to a market economy. It analyzes the main characteristics of the country's economy and the circumstances of the transition to the market. The leading role in transforming the economic and political system belonged to the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia. The "economic" sovereignty of the republic has become the core of Russia's state sovereignty. The implementation of the declaration required changes in legislation and the management system. Freedom of entrepreneurship, banking, loans, and other innovations have set the task of creating clear and reliable forms of property rights and corresponding guarantees of the state. Normative legal acts of the Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR and the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR adopted to establish Russia's economic independence and the transition to market relations caused a "war" of laws, in which the presidents of the USSR and Russia, Union and Russian deputies, ministers and regional leaders participated.

AB In today's world young people become the object of close attention from various socio-political forces, since an unformed worldview and insufficient experience in social and political analysis represent the very field where one can try to nurture the most exotic interpretations of the reality surrounding us. This article attempts to show the specifics of youth activism in the age of globalization using the example of youth movements for human dignity. In our opinion, stimulating and supporting young people's civic engagement, whether spontaneous or organized into youth movements, has the greatest potential to successfully mobilize young people toward purposeful, conscious and active participation in society and the state. We are convinced that virtually all pro-social youth movements are in one way or other movements for human dignity.

AB The author analyses the contemporary conflict between the governments of EU-members and nongovernmental organizations. Migrant crisis has remained a tough challenge for all areas of European society for many years. It calls into question the latest trends in interaction between NGOs and local authorities in EU. On the national level there have been many attempts to persecute actions of volunteers and the whole organizations engaged in search and rescue missions or other forms of migrant support. They are often accused of smuggling in an attempt to hinder ongoing operations and discourage future endeavors. On the supranational level EU legislative bodies remain unsuccessful in the mission to establish clear and unambiguous boundaries between actions of smugglers and civil society actors. This research defines union-wide tendencies illustrated by the numerous cases against nongovernmental organizations in Europe, their political and statutory relevance. The author explores the latest attempts of EU law-making bodies to eliminate existing contradictions and redefine the outlook of future interactions between conflicting parties. A significant attention is paid to the major controversies between governmental and nongovernmental actors in the field of migration and to the potential socio-political consequences for European society.

AB The article examines the phenomenon of the political longevity of German Chancellor A. Merkel. The subject of the study is the second period of her chancellorship (2013-2021). The author analyses what objective factors and personal qualities helped A. Merkel to win the 2013 and 2017 elections, overcome declining personal popularity and objective voter fatigue, and get through crises, including the migration and COVID-19. The article shows how the tactics and strategy of the first female chancellor have transformed in response to changing political conditions. It explores the tools with which A. Merkel built her image as the non-party leader of the nation, and how she became a hostage to the image she created in 2015. The decision to accept refugees was a turning point in Merkel's career. The author pays particular attention to the ways in which she helped to maintain her chancellorship. The conclusion is drawn that A. Merkel has developed her own personal method of securing power and maintaining the image she needs. The main secret of her success is not the use of force, but quick learning and adaptation, based on her instinct for political survival.

At present, 53 countries out of 192 members of the United Nations have been stagnating and recessing for many years, which manifested itself in the disorganization of the national economy, in political instability, in the growth of poverty, and social tension. Particular attention is paid to Russia, which can be attributed as traumatized society. The reasons for the formation of a society of trauma in Russia, its main features are analyzed: disproportions of the national economy, growth of social inequality, and attempts to implement new forms of class struggle. In conclusion, proposals are formulated for getting out of the traumatized state of society.

TI The cult of ancestors in modern Vietnamese society: Perception, role,

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Vietnam; Vietnamese society; cult of ancestors; religion; traditional
   beliefs
AB During the whole history, worshiping the ancestors has been the tradition in Vietnamese society, but the status of this religious practice does not always remain unchanged. The cult of ancestors is said to be the basis of Vietnamese mentality. Despite the traditional nature of ancestor worship, it continues changing. This is the living matter of the nation, which adapts to new conditions of existence. In this article, three following issues are focused on: (1) the transformations have occurred with the cult of ancestors; (2) the status of ancestor worship today; (3) the tendencies of this belief and the forces that drive it. As sources in this article, scholarly publications of Vietnamese and Russian researchers, official documents and the authors' field materials are used. The basis of the research methodology is the systems concept and the principle of historicism. The main methods are observation and comparison. According to the authors, the basis for the development of practice is laid in the very idea of traditional Vietnamese beliefs, in which the concept of ancestors has been expanded to either historical people or political leaders. However, there is an increase in worship of the nation-wide ancestors of antiquity in modern Vietnam. In addition, the past century also created its heroes, who are gradually taking their place on the altars. Today, the dramatic changes in Vietnamese economy and society contribute to the social development in all areas, including the spiritual life of people. In this case, the development does not mean progress, but the search for new forms of reflecting change. The goal here is to discover these new forms, evaluate their significance and understand the consequences. The article analyzes the position of the cult of ancestors in modern Vietnam, investigates the factors influencing the development of this phenomenon. The authors also attempt to analyze the impact of today's events on the future of ancestors worship. Based on the analysis, the authors conclude that, in the near future, a number of transformations will occur with the cult of ancestors. These changes will reflect political and economic transformations in the country, the people's memory of the wars of the 20th century, and hopes for future achievements. However, the changes will not affect the basic principles of the belief.

AB The article is dedicated to the events in IMEMO in the first half of the 2000s, associated with the activities of the Academician Nodari Simoniya, the new director of the Institute. In 2002, Simoniya added Gennadii Chufrin to his team as one of his deputy directors. In 2002, the editor-in-chief of the "World Economy and International Relations "journal was replaced. After the death of German Diligenskii, who had been heading the journal since 1988, the well-known political scientist Andrei Ryabov became the new editor-in-chief He managed to preserve the best traditions laid down by his predecessor. The article also traces the main measures for the partial reorganization of the Institute's structure, carried out by the Academician Simoniya in 2001-2006. The author reveals the substance of this reorganization aimed at concentrating the efforts of the IMEMO research team on the study of the most pressing and important problems of the contemporary world. One of the important decisions was the creation of the Center for Energy Problems headed by the Director of the Institute. The emergence of this research unit was the result of numerous requests received by the Institute from government agencies and economic structures, which wanted to have qualified expert assessments in this area. Therefore, it was decided to concentrate research on energy problems in one Center. Several previously existing research subdivisions also underwent reorganization: the Department of Developing Countries, which studied the Third world, was transformed into the Center for Development and Modernization Problems, where, among other things, Russia's problems were addressed; the Department studying the internal political processes in Western countries was transformed into the Center for Socio-Economic and Socio-Political Studies of Western Countries and Russia. The Department of North American Studies, the Department of International Political Problems, the Department of Global Economic Problems and Foreign Economic Policy, and the Center for Asia-Pacific Studies were reorganized as well in order to actualize their studies. The measures for the partial reorganization of IMEMO were explained not only by considerations of research expediency, but also by the increasingly insistent demands of the government to reduce the number of employees of academic institutes in the system of the Russian Academy of Sciences. By the end of 2006, there was a slight decrease in the number of doctors of sciences at the Institute in comparison with 2001. This was largely due to objective reasons - retirement or death of senior researchers. But at the same time, there was a significant influx of young people into the postgraduate school. In general, the management of IMEMO succeeded in preserving human resources and academic potential of the Institute.

AB The article discusses the possibilities of using PROZIS-analysis, a new visualization and data analysis method in sociological research. The method allows fixing six indicators of users' network activity: the number of posters, reposts, audience coverage, requests, sources, messages. PROZIS-analysis allows assessing the level of public interest in any significant event/phenomenon/process, tracking the dynamics of the dissemination of information about it in the global network, including technologies for its targeted promotion. The fixation of specific numerical values of these indicators is carried out using the toolkit of available online services. In the framework of this study, the WordStat service from Yandex was used to estimate the number of user requests. For the other five, IQbuzz, which evaluates user posts on social networks, was used. Key indicators of network activity are divided into two groups: the first - "sources", "posters" and "messages" - characterizes those who actively disseminate information and how actively new ideas are being promoted in the Internet space; the second group - "reposts", "requests" and "coverage" - is the periphery, its analysis allows judging how new ideas arouse massive interest and how actively they are assimilated by users. Data from PROZIS-analysis are used to create PROZIS-diagrams. The PROZISdiagram is an applied visualization and express analysis tool that reflects the dynamics of the core and periphery indicators, shows their interconnections, mutual influence over time. PROZIS-diagrams are divided into diffuse ones, showing the dynamics and scale of new ideas' diffusion, and logarithmic ones, suitable for long-term analysis. Expert assessment and competent interpretation of the data of PROZIS-diagrams allows making a quick assessment of the situation; obtaining an instant "snapshot" of the dissemination of information for a specific time period; and conducting a deeper sociological analysis, taking into account the sex and age composition of posters, their average activity, and the ratio of activity of the nucleus and the periphery. As an example of the implementation of the method, data on the socio-political activity of users during the preparation and organization of the meeting of Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden on June 16, 2021. In general, PROZIS-analysis is suitable for assessing the level of public interest in any significant event, tracking the dynamics of the dissemination of information about it in the global network.

TI The Krasnoyarsk banquet of Colonel Mikhail Fedorovich on 22 October
   1918: The "anatomy" of the political scandal in the context of the
   democratic counter-revolution
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Mikhail Fedorovich; officers; state power; political practices;
   democracy; socialism; monarchism; Civil War; Siberia
AB In the article, for the first time, the author analyzes the causes, circumstances and consequences of the banquet that Colonel Mikhail I. Fedorovich, the chief of the garrison of Krasnoyarsk, arranged on 22 October 1918 in honor of the arrival of military trains of foreign allies of the Provisional All-Russian Government. At the banquet, there was a political scandal related to the performance of the anthem of the former Russian Empire "God Save the Tsar!", which was perceived at the initial stage of the Civil War in Russia as a violation of the norm. The author aims to explain the relations between officers, society and the government in the conditions of the democratic counter-revolution in Yenisei Province, which was the "middle" territory of the anti-Bolshevik political regime in the east of Russia. The research is based on the methods of concrete historical analysis and cultural semiotics. In terms of semiotics, the scandal is one of the basic mechanisms of culture. Deliberate violation of the accepted system of values is aimed at breaking established norms and seizing leadership. External spontaneity, symbolism, excessive emotionality and lack of detailed argumentation are considered as necessary characteristics of a scandal. The research is based on a wide range of diverse sources - periodicals, office documents and materials of personal origin. As a result of the analysis, the author comes to the following conclusions. The main "author" of the political "challenge" was Colonel Fedorovich, the head of the garrison. Along with the organization of a large-scale celebration and the role of its manager, he assumed the representative functions of power. The head of the garrison positioned himself as the first person of Krasnoyarsk and the entire Yenisei Province. In doing so, he violated the basic principle of the democratic counter-revolution, which placed the army out of politics. Fedorovich's statements that the banquet "did not have a political connotation" refer only to the fact that the head of the garrison and most of the officers of his staff headquarters were not monarchists in the literal sense of the word. They were adherents of the unity of command and patriots of the image of great Russia, which did not then have its own anthem. In addition, the banquet demonstrated the disdainful attitude of the military to the self-government bodies and the slogans of the popular rule. This was a blow to the hierarchy of values of the democratic counter-revolution. All the "incidents" of the banquet and their subsequent interpretations became an expression of the conflict of interests and values of the military and the socialists who fought for power as representatives of self-government bodies and the public. The consequences of the events of October 1918, the public culmination of which was the scandalous banquet, were negative. Krasnoyarsk, which was one of the most democratic administrative centers in Siberia, became a city with the most severe military intervention in political processes and in the life of the population.

AB One of the actors in the armed conflict in Syria is the extremist group "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham" (HTS), which controls the territory of Idlib province in coordination with a number of other armed groups. Originally emerging as closely associated with the al-Qaeda terrorist network as "al-Nusra Front", this organization has undergone a number of transformations in recent years as a result of both external and internal factors. Consistently loyal to jihadist principles, "al-Nusra Front" (and its incarnations, such as "Jabhat Fatah al-Sham" and "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham") has demonstrated a certain flexibility throughout its history, which manifested in its attempts to adapt to changes and the wide use of soft power tools. The article analyzes the reasons for the rebranding of the group, which is trying to get rid of the odious image not only in the eyes of the Syrians, but also in the international arena. In particular, the author concludes that HTS is guided by the example of the Afghani Taliban movement in its attempts to obtain the status of a legitimate and negotiable participant in the conflict. There are signs that the strategy chosen by HTS is partly working with its message received in the Western expert community. It calls for a revision of the United States' and its allies' policies in relation to the HTS group, which has allegedly "severed ties with transnational jihadist networks and now seeks to enter the sphere of political participation in the future of Syria". The article maintains that there are doubts about both the possibility of a conscious evolution of HTS into a more moderate movement, and the sincerity of their rejection of the "global jihad" agenda as declared by the group's leaders. There is reason to believe that the group is not going to completely abandon terrorist activities outside the zone of the Syrian conflict.

TI The Way We Think When Reading Dostoevsky Today
SO RUSSIAN STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY
LA English
DT Article
DE literature; political philosophy; history; Dostoevsky; Europe; Russia;
   people; society; man
AB Fyodor M. Dostoevsky's analysis of the theme of Russia-Europe relations, as well as the nature of Russian society, is replete with concept-metaphors like "people," "national principle," "soul," "spirit," and so forth. These concepts and terms are proposed by the writer himself, and the method of research that is based on this terminology has been present in Russian public consciousness for almost a century and a half now. This creates the illusion that these terms can be used to understand the basic differences between Russia and Europe, particularly their fundamentally different property relations and rights. The writer's answer to the question of difference is as follows: Russia's greatness consists in its rejection of European darkness, and its troubles derive from an inconsistency, from the insufficient firmness of that rejection. This article argues that the reason for the long-term "explanatory power" of these terms used by the polemicist Dostoevsky has been determined by the insufficient development of those economic and political relations that objectively exist in Russia. Thus, the Diary of a Writer still resonates with the reader who is gullible but distant from "strong culture" (V. Kelle) and uninclined to reflection, the reader who never abandons the dreams of Russia's "special path" that would allow it, "in one fell swoop," to escape the difficulties of the modern world. But these dreams never come true, and, contrary to the calls for traditionalism, Russia stubbornly tries to follow the same path as the rest of humanity. The longer this process goes on, the more the explanatory power of political polemicist Dostoevsky's concept-metaphors wanes.

AB The article is devoted to a microhistorical analysis of the memoirs of the Petersburg historian and art historian N.D. Flittner (1879-1957), the researcher of the Hermitage (19181950), the author of a number of classical studies on the art of the Ancient East, a professor at Leningrad State University (1921-1935) and the St. Petersburg Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture named after Ilya Repin at the Russian Academy of Arts (1937-1956). This text is focused mainly on the stage of her professional development: for example, Flittner writes about training at the Higher Women's (Bestuzhev) courses and at St. Petersburg University (1899-1903), describes the period of museum and scientific work in the Hermitage (1918-1950), showing personal experience of transformations of the academic circle during the formation of Soviet everyday life and the establishment of a new scientific discourse subordinate to the ideology and political goals of the Bolsheviks. The author of the article argues that the analysis of the language and microcontexts of the description of private life is an important optics for the researcher of the history of Russian humanitarian knowledge, but also complements the general picture of the spread of female education in Russia, radical changes in the museum sphere and the scientific community after 1917. Of particular interest is the very fact that Flittner's memoirs, created in the 1940s and 1950s, were focused on the pre-revolutionary past: here we pay attention to how the milestones of the "big" history are consciously or unconsciously superimposed on the individual history, giving it a macro-context. Of particular interest is the academic circle of historians of antiquity reflected in their memoirs, a striking example of which is the circle of the Egyptologist B.A. Turaev, which became the starting point for the formation of an intellectual network of interaction between his students.

AB Research objectives: To use historical monuments of Persian origin from the 14th c. as a possible source for the political, legal, and chancellery history in the Jochid Ulus and for specific features of the status of "emir of ulus", a type of high official in Chinggisid states.
   Materials and methods of research: The basic materials are yarlighs included into the "Dastur al-katib" of Muhammad b. Hindushah Nakhchivani in its Persian original as well as in German translation by J. von Hammer-Purgstall. The present work also employs other medieval sources on history of the Golden Horde and Iran in the Hulaguid and Jalayir epochs. The methods of research are historical, diplomatic, historical, legal, and comparative historical analysis which amount to an interdisciplinary approach which allows to study historical documents with the highest effectiveness.
   Scientific novelty: This represents the first Russian translation of the first yarligh on the appointment of the emir of ulus from the "Dastur al-katib" which is studied as a historical source, an example of Mongol chancellery practices, and as a legal monument.
   Results of the research: The analysis of this document allows one to reconstruct the legal status of the emir of ulus as a high official in Chinggisid states, the requirements for candidates of this position, the rights and obligations of this official, while drawing parallels between similar positions in Iran and the Golden Horde. Comparative diplomatic analysis allows one to clarify similarities in the official paper work in uluses of Hulaguids and Jochids and to confirm the common roots of chancellery traditions in these states that were heirs of the Mongol Empire.

AB This article investigates the strategies of monastic patronage employed by women in medieval Epirus. It looks at how royal and noble women effectively applied this traditional tool of public engagement to a variety of ends-a display of political claims, self-representation, networking, and a rise in the social hierarchy. Recognizing the gradual changes in the public perception of female sponsors, it measures their actions against their perception by male writers and elucidates the most common ways of women's involvement, from participation in traditional -family projects to independent endowment acts distinguished by personal agendas. It also attempts to shed some light on the underrepresentation of female monastic institutions in the region that compelled the local women to offer donations almost exclusively to male foundations. This study considers that the main reason for the patronesses' behavior was the longevity of prominent institutions and their ability to ensure the donors' continuous commemoration.

ID REINDUSTRIALIZATION
AB The current stage of development of Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). countries indicates that these states are being forced not only to re-industrialize, but to industrialize their economies almost from scratch, since their industries, for known political reasons, were completely destroyed or are technologically obsolete. This article investigates innovative factors in the development of re-industrialization processes in the countries of the EAEU based on the development and implementation of targeted national policy. The study puts forward a hypothesis about the existence of a dependence between the rates of innovative development of countries, on the one hand, and foreign direct investment and research and development (R&D). expenditures, as well as trends in industrial production development, on the other, as a summary indicator of the reindustrialization of the national economy. To confirm the hypothesis, the following methods were used: statistical analysis, which allowed the primary processing of data that describe the dynamics of indicators of innovative development of countries and its factors, and a comparative analysis of the innovative development of the countries of the EAEU, which constitute the object of this study. The first part provides a sequential analysis of changes in specific indicators describing the innovative development of the countries under consideration, as well as factors that, according to the hypothesis, have a significant impact on it, thereby enabling the evaluation of the general trends in the dynamics of innovative processes within the selected object of this study. In the second part, through the establishment of correlations between the factors and results of the innovative development of countries, measures are proposed to improve the national policy of innovative development and re-industrialization.

DE Kazan Khanate; Ulus of Jochi; Grand Duchy of Moscow; Crimean Khanate;

AB Research objective: To analyze and verify the concept of "party division" of the political elite of the Kazan Khanate.
   Research materials: Historiographical sources, Russian chronicles, historical writings, diplomatic documents, etc.
   Research results and novelty: According to many researchers, political conflicts in the Kazan Khanate were caused by the struggle between the pro-Moscow and Eastern parties. One group of Kazan inhabitants focused on trade and economic ties with the Russian lands, and the other - with the Muslim world. The conflict of economic interests allegedly led to deep political contradictions, which served as a basis of the formation of the parties. However, as a result of this study, it was found that the semantics of the contents in the chronicles is not consistent with the concept of "party division". The lengthy chronicle passages accompanying the descriptions of the events in the Moscow-Kazan relations were designed to show the negative qualities of the Kazan people (adulation and treachery), comparing them with the wicked peoples from the Bible. However, the researchers, applying the so-called rational approach to apologetic excursions, explained the "adulation" and "impiety" of the Kazan inhabitants as manifestations of party struggles. Not only that the concept of party division does not fit into the semantic aspect of chronicle reports, it is also faced with a number of logical contradictions arising from a comprehensive analysis of sources.

AB The article deals with the peculiarities of the perception of socio-political changes by Florentine citizens in the last quarter of the XIV- early XV c., when the dictatorship of the Guelph Party was overthrown, a limit was set to the regime of junior workshops, and urban society returned to republican order, reaching a relative balance of structures involved in the management - senior and junior workshops, as well as those who returned to the city of the arch-elves. This was reflected in the perception of citizens as the achievement of relative harmony by society in a rich, prosperous city that has achieved significant foreign policy successes (inclusion in the sphere of the Florentine dominion of Arezzo and Pisa). Next, the "price of victory" is investigated: the restriction of the norms of Florentine democracy in favor of the emerging oligarchic system.

AB The article analyzes euphemia as a linguocultural phenomenon in the Vietnamese language. It examines the interrelationship between euphemisms and taboos. The author distinguishes five functional types of euphemisms. They are: euphemisms-word taboos used to avoid names of frightful things and phenomena; euphemisms to substitute something obscene, indecent, unpleasant; etiquette euphemisms; political euphemisms; puns (wordplay) for an intended humorous effect. There are the following large fields of euphemisms: everyday-spoken and socio-political. There have been determined euphemism formation modes which are divided into two large categories: structural (formal) and lexico-semantic ones. The article analyzes different euphemism formation modes. In the course of the study, the author has used a broad illustrative material. The research work relevance is due to the widespread usage of euphemisms in the media and communication.

AB Based on the analysis of little-known and forgotten letters of Russian writers, most of them introduced into scholarly circulation for the first time, this article clarifies the existing perceptions of various types of letters to the editor. The purpose of the work is to identify and describe cases of changing conventions between the writer, the critic, and the reader in the early twentieth century. The notice form of the letter, traditionally used to notify readers of ongoing rearrangements in editorial boards or groups, as well as the writer's membership in a particular literary publication, remained unchanged. Conversely, the writer's letter as a response to a reader, a critic, or an opponent were forms influenced by a new sociocultural situation, characterised by an increasing number of printed publications and the appearance of a new type of reader and critic. The article establishes that, when replying to a reader, a social or political opponent via a newspaper, the writer turned his response into a public statement, expressed in accordance with their reputation and social stance. The writer's reply to an opponent often took the form of an open letter and became an instance of civic action. As a response to a critic, the writer's letter to the editor indicated his refusal to regard the critic as an authoritative participant of the literary process, one equal in status to the writer. When addressing the reader through the medium of a newspaper, the writer discussed the factual aspect of the critic's statement, not their opinion of the writer's work, thus emphasising the insignificance of their role. A response to a critic the writer found authoritative instead took the form of an article, or a column. Writers' letters to the editor of the early twentieth century reflect contradictory phenomena in the literary process, caused by the emergence of mass readership and a reconsideration of the terms set between it, the writer and the critic.

DE philosophy of language; semantic; context
AB In modern analytic philosophy, a special type of words, whose meanings are very sensitive to the context, is distinguished. Indexical terms such as "I", "this" or "today" acquire their meanings depending on the speech situation in which they are used. Based on the analysis of such words, an idea is formed of what the context of a language expression is. In general terms, context consists of three components: agent, time and position. However, when analyzing the meaning of legal language ascriptive expressions, we find that sometimes quite different contextual factors influence or determine the meaning. This circumstance determines the need to clarify our ideas about what the context of a linguistic expression is. Depending on these our ideas, the ways of interconnecting words and contextual factors also change.

DE ascription; philosophy of language; semantic; context
AB From the whole set of ascriptive expressions, at least two types can be distinguished: expressions, the use of which is determined by a certain extralinguistic rule, and expressions, the use of which is determined by the personal position or assessment of the agent of speech. For expressions of the first type, it is characteristic that their use in the language may turn out to be either legal or illegal. Whereas the use of ascriptive expressions of both types can be considered from the point of view of communicative success. In both cases, the context of the speech situation plays a decisive role. It is thanks to the context that it becomes possible to determine whether the speaker is oriented to a certain rule or his statement is oriented to a personal setting. In exactly the same way, the context is used to assess the legality of the use of an ascriptive expression, since the law itself is one of the elements that form the context. This use of context by John Perry is called presemantic.

TI Strategies for conceptualizing historical responsibility in the context
   of modern media representations
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE historical responsibility; media environment; historical culture; media
   presentations; historical consciousness; practices of historical
   responsibility
AB The article analyzes theoretical models of historical responsibility and the peculiarities of their application in the context of modern media presentations. A comparative analysis of the models of historical responsibility in modern foreign philosophy and social and humanitarian knowledge clearly indicates the dominance of the universalist and constructivist approaches in understanding historical responsibility. In the latter case, it is viewed as a social practice that develops within a certain community and is focused on appropriation or participation in the distribution of symbolic capital. Historical responsibility is a "tense" relationship of the emerging sociocultural situation, where the discursive practices of historical responsibility (imparting guilt; identifying victims, criminals, participants, observers) turn out to be a kind of a mechanism of symbolic dominance in the political space. This state of affairs cannot escape the influence of, first of all, the media. They turn out to be an environment for the actualization and transformation of historical responsibility discourses that begin to obey the media's logic, goals and objectives. Based on the methodological ideas of Pierre Bourdieu's theory of symbolic struggle and sociophilosophical analysis, the scientist, instrumentalist and pluralistic media strategies in relation to the discourse of historical responsibility were identified and analyzed. The main criterion for highlighting these media strategies was the role of the history researchers' professional community. Each of them was presented in the context of opportunities and risks. The analysis shows that, in the modern symbolic space, these strategies are blended, as a result of which various subjects of historical responsibility not only contribute to the fragmentation of space, but also create potentially conflict-prone clusters. In the context of works by A. Rigney, A. Erll, M. Rothberg, L. Bond, and R. Crownshaw, the article demonstrates that the blending of media strategies is especially noticeable in the context of new transcultural and cross-border ways of collective memory dynamics, when the familiar images of the victim, the criminal, the participant, and the observer find themselves in new interpretative contexts of the host culture, the historical politics of the host society, and the dynamics of its transgenerational values.

   investigation; investigative case; publication of documents
AB Prince Vasilii Dolgorukov was one of the charismatic figures of the Petrine epoch when he came to the fore among the closest associates of Peter I. He proved himself as a talented military commander and an active administrator. He enjoyed a special trust of Peter, who gave him difficult assignments. V. Vl. Dolgorukov's career was suddenly cut short in 1718, when the case of Tsarevich Alexei, Peter's heir, began. During the investigation in 1718, Alexei betrayed a lot of people involved in his escape, including Dolgorukov. It turned out that at the time of the aggravation of conflict, when the tsar demanded that his son reject the throne and become a monk, Dolgorukov tried to establish relations with the prince to gain his favor in the case of the death of the tsar. However, this attempt failed as he was an adversary for the circle of Ale-xei. Therefore, Alexei and his supporter A. V. Kikin tried to discredit Prince Dolgorukov during the investigation. They largely succeeded. Prince Dolgorukov could not refute most of their testimonies. He was saved from the death penalty by the petitions of influential figures and the fact that he was not involved in organizing the escape of the tsarevich. The archival documents published for the first time (materials of the investigative case of Prince V. Vl. Dolgorukov) allow us to consider the whole intrigue around Dolgorukov; the complex tense situation at the court; the relationships between people at the time of the conflict between Peter and Alexei, and during the investigation of the case of Tsarevich Alexei.

AB This paper aims to introduce an important document of the Petrine time into scholarly circulation. The last will of the wife of Tsarevich Alexei, Crown Princess Charlotte Christina Sophia, written on the day of her death on October 21, 1715, in the form of a petition addressed to her father-in-law - Peter I - has been known until now only in two translations, made in the eighteenth and in the first half of the nineteenth centuries, going back to an unknown original. This publication contains the text of the petition testament of Crown Princess Charlotte Christina Sophia recently discovered by A. V. Morokhin in the Manuscripts Department of the Russian National Library (St Petersburg). The document is in German written in fluent Neo-Gothic italics of the early eighteenth century on both sides of two sheets of yellowed paper. Comparing the signatures of Crown Princess Charlotte Christina Sophia under several of her letters originating from the archives of Germany with the signature on the document published makes it possible to conclude that the document is authentic. The article provides a complete transcription of the original source, as well as its literal translation into modern Russian. A comparative analysis of the original text with later editions of the petition testament allows the authors to define the newly found document as the original source. The letter of Crown Princess Charlotte Christina Sophia is considered in the broad context of the political and dynastic history of the Petrine state. The circumstances that come to light during the analysis of the tragic story of Princess Charlotte's death help visualise the expressive features of everyday life in Peter I's inner family circle.

DE Kingdom of the Two Sicilies; Naples; Sicily; press; public opinion;

AB The article deals with the reaction of the Rus-sian press to the revolutionary events in Southern Italy in 1820-1821. The main sources were the journals "Vestnik Evropy", "Nevsky Spectator", "Son of the Fatherland", and the official newspaper "St. Petersburg Vedomosti", and the foreign press was also involved. In the course of the study, the main methods of conveying information to the reading public in Russia on such issues as the development of the revolutionary process in Naples, the reaction of the powers of the Holy Alliance, the role of the Carbonari society and the significance of the separatist movement in Sicily were established. It was possible to correct the conclusions of scientists of the USSR regarding the presentation of the news agenda in journals close to the Decembrist circles. The novelty of the study is seen in the fact that the prevailing influence of the Austrian press on the Russian press was established; the latter imported views on the constitutional process in Naples as the result of a conspiracy by the "sect" of the Carbonari. Materials were established that stood out from the prevailing agenda and considered the events of the Nea-politan Revolution of 1820 from the point of view of political economy.

DT Article
DE Trans-Urals; a model of urbanization; proto-cities; urban structures
AB The article is devoted to the origins of urbanization in Western Siberia, which should be associated with the formation of ancient fortified settlements - fortresses that appeared on this territory in the Bronze Age and proto-cities formed in the early Iron Age. The first simple fortifications in the form of stockades or fortified dwellings in the forest-steppe zone of Trans-Urals were fixed on the materials of the Bronze Age monuments. During this period their number was insignificant, it is known about12, the bulk continued to be unfortitied settlement. The increase in the number of hillforts was greater in the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age (45). They were round-oval hillfors with an area up to 4 hectares. There were major suburbs around them. The citadels of the time were poorly fortified fences. The appearance of first fortifications is connected with the destabilization of the political situation in the region as a result of the influx of migrants from the North of Western Siberia. Then the strengthening of the village with a palisade or a fence was not a defensive measure but probably ideological in nature. The aim was to preserve their cultural traditions within phratry. In the Early Iron Age the number of hillforts increases and stands more than 70 in the forest-steppe zone of Trans-Urals. Within this period the dynamics of fortification is well traced. Already at that time there was specialization of fortified settlements as centers of metalworking, import, exchange, cooperation of foreign population. The fortresses became the centers of origin and transmission of cultural innovation, and the process of urbanization and the resulting changes in the ancient and medieval societies to the greatest extent determined the development of the region.
   The process of urbanization of the Trans-Urals between two ages was influenced by the Great Migration, which was a kind of inhibitor. An outflow of the population to the west led to a dramatic decrease in the number of fortresses in the Medieval Age, but parameters and protective functions of hillforts increased at the same time. Archaeological materials demonstrate that the socioeconomic status of some hillforts, which performed not only a defensive function, but also had administrative, political and religious significance, substantially increased at that time. The actual formation of towns began after the Tyumen Khanate was formed in the Trans-Urals with its capital Chimgi-Tura (and, lately, Isker). When Siberia was annexed to the Moscow state and the Russian population began to assimilate it, the towns received a new impetus for their further development. Archaeological materials obtained during the excavations at those monuments demonstrate that urban settlements that appeared in Siberia during its colonization not only served as military and administrative fortresses, but also were bases of handicraft, industry and agriculture. Tobolsk, which was the first settlement in Siberia to receive the official status of a town, is one of the most striking examples.

The letters are kept in the Bakhmeteff archive of Columbia University. The main place in them is given to the characteristics of the organizational and financial contexts of the publication of A. V. Kartashev's book Reconstruction of Holy Russia. The preface to the publication notes also the importance of socio-political, church-religious and academic contexts, only outlined in the letters. In their totality they will allow to understand the author's intention and the meaning of the book's content. Among other topics of the correspondence that are significant for the study of the history of St Sergious Theological Orthodox Institute and the biography of A. V. Kartashev, the publisher highlights the change in the composition of students at the institute and as a result of this its increased role in training priests for Orthodox churches, as well as the historian's vacation, which he used to write the final books on the history of the Russian Orthodox Church and on the Ecumenical Councils. Finally, the publisher underlines the special significance of the historian's memorial comprehension of the past of the institute, with which his fate in emigration was inextricably linked.

AB This article is devoted to analysing the scholarly path of the outstanding Russian Africanist Apollon Davidson. His personality has already attracted scholarly attention, primarily in connection with the history of the Centre for African Studies of the Institute of Global History, which Davidson created in 1971. In this study, comprehensive analysis of the subject of Russia and Africa in Davidson's work is conducted for the first time. Earlier research has only partially touched upon this theme. The main sources are Davidson's works. The origins of Davidson's interest in Africa are analyzed. This interest was closely connected with the atmosphere of Stalin's Soviet Union, in the conditions of which the historian's personality was formed. The analysis shows that avoiding problems related to the political situation was a conscious choice for Davidson, who sought to avoid having to write propaganda essays within the framework of the dominant ideology. The article identifies the key subjects that attracted Davidson's attention: the formation of Africa's image in Russia, the position of Russia in the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902, the Comintern and Africa, and the main aspects of Soviet foreign policy in Africa. It is shown that Davidson was especially interested in the African travels of Nikolai Gumilyov and the surge of interest in Africa among the Russian intelligentsia of the Silver Age. The publication of most of Davidson's studies was possible only in the post-Soviet period.

DE global governance; identity; migrations; human rights; theory of
   justice; theories of migration
AB A study of political discourse on global migration in the light of justice and human rights concepts reveals of two polar points of view. Proponents of the first disposition associate movement with citizenship, have freedoms and rights, but only within internal borders. Thus, the state acts as a restrictor and a regulator of migration flows. Another perspective goes beyond national borders, granting everyone rights and freedoms. The concept of global governance and the creation of regimes in certain areas brings to the discussion the possibility of abandoning 'local' barriers and, following globalization, building a global public concept. At the same time, external factors exert influence upon the development and popularity of theories. And in terms of the movement of people around the world, or 'global migration,' they are prevailing, setting a pattern of development. In recent decades, the formation and scale of new types of cross-border migration definitely indicate the importance of this issue. At the same time, most of the analytical papers focus on case studies and isolated trends of recent years. This article analyzes the current discussion of the possibilities and limitations of migration from the point of view of political science and J. Rawls' theory of justice. The author aims to highlight polar and more moderate points of view, as well as to correlate them with the concept of `global governance' by T. Weiss, to analyze the possibilities and limitations on the way to the formation of a `global migration regime', to outline the Russian approach to the role of the state in controlling migration flows, as well as to draw the reader's attention both to new trends in the perception of migration and the direction of political discourse on this topic.

DE Cuba; Ernesto Guevara; planning; economic debate; socialism; Marxism;
   political economy
AB The paper covers Ernesto Guevara's views on managing the economy of Cuba which he expressed in the economic debate in the first half of 1960s. Participating in this discussion as a proponent of the budgetary finance system Guevara opposed advocates of the autofinancing system. During the debate he appealed to Marxist theory relying on original works of Marx, Engels and Lenin. From Guevara's perspective, constructing socialism meant a transition to a qualitatively new system of categories among which centralized planning was the crucial one. Thus, this new system was utterly different from the one which was revealed by Marx in Das Kapital when the German scientists focused on capitalist mode of production. On the contrary, Guevara's opponents highlighted that socialist construction could and should count on categories which functioned on the capitalist phase in order to promote efficiency. Being the Minister of Industries, Guevara brought his theory into practice at the production units that belonged to his Ministry. The author investigates several fundamental articles written by Guevara during the polemics, other sources the show Guevara's vision of socialism and works of theoreticians whose ideas were used by the debaters. The paper also introduces archival materials (Russian State Archive of the Economy) that reveal some peculiarities of Cuban planning system formation.

AB Introduction. The author researched and prepared for publication four acts of 1547-1566 issued by Ivan IV and the appanage prince Vladimir Andreevich on the villages of the Trinity-Sergius Monastery in Vereysky and Dmitrov counties. The diplomas are studied in the context of the corpus of act and narrative sources, containing the plot of the relationship of the appanage prince with his suzerain. Methods and materials. The task of this article is to clarify the real participation of Prince Vladimir in the political and administrative life of the country for three years from 1566 to 1569 and is solved by a comprehensive analysis of narrative texts and the act material in which the real prerogatives of the appanage prince are documented. Analysis. An indicator of Vladimir Staritsky's administrative and political activity is the intensity and nature of the charters issued and preserved by him, and their correlation with the acts of Ivan IV, to which the key part of the article is devoted. Results. It has been established that in addition to the acts drawn up in the office of the appanage prince relatively independently, acts have been preserved in the compilation of which protographs were used. When creating the acts in 1566, the offices of the tsar and the appanage prince used the letters of 1547 and 1548, the form of which was reproduced without significant changes. It is hypothesized that the acts of Prince Vladimir Andreevich and Ivan IV indicate a kind of competition in piety between the autocratic monarch and the prince of the blood.

AB This article explores an important archival source, the personal files of deportees, the original form of the document compiled by the NKVD characterizing the identity of a person who is on special settlement. These are massive official documents of a personal nature, applied to all adults deported during World War II from different regions and republics of the former USSR. The author reveals previously classified personal files and documents on the legal status of special settlers. The introduction of new documents into circulation made it possible to shed light on many aspects of the life of deportees related to their social and legal adaptation in new places of settlements. A personal file clearly demonstrates both the conditions of detention at the special settlement, and changes in the regulatory framework governing the life of this category within the framework of the special settlement system in the USSR. In accordance with the ongoing changes, a special commandant introduced each special settler to the new standards, who were given receipts. The file contains four receipts that allow one to divide the period from 1944 to 1957 into four stages. The article emphasizes that for post-deportation generations, the presence of personal files containing personal data was a good opportunity in restoring not only history, but also genealogy. It has both important scholarly, socio-legal, and political significance for the study of destinies, both of individuals and of entire nations. As examples, some documents are contained in the personal files of the evicts.

AB Introduction. The Transcaucasian states waged war with each other and desperately wanted to find some disinterested party to resolve their territorial disputes in 1918-1921. The territory was first occupied by the countries of the Triple Alliance, then by the Entente countries, and each of them contributed to the formation or resolution of territorial disputes. Methods and materials. Based on the historical-systemic and historical-genetic approaches, the author determines which territorial changes were proposed in the region by representatives of the United States and why. The documents collected in the State Archive of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Archive of Political Documents of the Office of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and the National Archive of Armenia were involved for analysis. Analysis. The influence of the United States on the solution of territorial issues was determined by the general approach to the territory as passing into a mandate state. During the discussion of this issue, the understanding of the American representatives about the borders of this zone expanded first from Armenia in a general sense to Transcaucasia, and then narrowed to the borders of Turkish Armenia, which brought them back to the issue of the borders of the Republic of Armenia. At the same time, representatives working in the region proposed a plan for interstate disengagement, different from the British plan, and tried to introduce a governor-general in the disputed territory. Results. The remoteness from the region, the presence of a single channel of information about it through the Armenian Diaspora in the United States affected the narrow perception of the situation in the region by American representatives. The issue of the adoption of a mandate over Armenia or Transcaucasia and Armenia somehow got connected with the issue of costs for its effective implementation. The failed attempt to create an American governor-general in the disputed territories recorded a lack of understanding of the situation in the region and the possibilities of its control and provoked more conflicts between Armenians and Azerbaijani.

AB The pandemic has produced the global COVID-19 vaccine market with various stakeholders acting in their economic self-interest. At the same time, some governments use vaccines for pursuing national interests and expanding their international influence. Using scientific works on the topic and documents from WHO, GAVI, WTO, IMF, government documents and think tank reports, the author analyzes vaccine diplomacy as a branch of medical diplomacy and identifies changes that occur under pandemic impact. The article examines the current policy of China, as it has achieved the most notable success in medical services export, primarily to developing countries, and Chinese pharmaceutical companies play a prominent role in the global vaccine market. It raises serious concerns of the West, which accuses Beijing of using coronacrisis to establish a new (China-centric) world order. It is concluded that government capacity to protect public health and control epidemic spread is among the significant criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of State policy, and its own vaccine industry begins to be regarded as an important element of national security. There is also a considerable increase in the role of healthcare in foreign policy of a number of States using medical and vaccine diplomacies as a means of achieving political goals. COVID-19 vaccines are becoming a strategic asset that affects the country's position on the world stage and generates a new field of geopolitical rivalry. But at the same time, vaccine diplomacy could serve as a dialogue platform in cases when interstate relations are in a deep crisis. And it may lead to awareness of the need to train specialists in the field of medical diplomacy.

AB The article is devoted to the consideration of the role of replicators (genes and memes) in the biosociocultural evolution of a person in the modern global information society. Based on the theory of replicators by R. Dawkins, the concept of cellular autopoiesis by U. Maturana and F. Varela, and an integrative approach to the evolution of biological and sociocultural systems, the paper points to the commonality of genes and memes in terms of their distribution from one person to another and in the media sphere. The category "brain" is introduced into scientific circulation, which expands the philosophical ideas about the genetic and socio-cultural co-evolution of a person and his transformation in society. In this context, attention is focused on the fact that genes, together with memes, play a key role in the transmission of biosociocultural information in nature and society. The article notes that the media sphere and the brain of the person himself act as elements of replication of cultural replicators (meme-viruses). It is shown that the basis of social interaction and the transfer of memetic information from person to person can be imitation processes associated with the movement of matter. This circumstance gives reason to believe that the transfer of knowledge about the reality around us occurs on the basis of uniform laws of self-organization of biological and sociocultural systems. In this regard, based on the principles of synergetics, the article discusses and describes such properties of memes as replication, competition, durability, survivability and independence from the will of the carrier. Also, in the course of our study, it was determined that in the global world, memes began to spread almost instantly in the media space due to the universal electronic environment and the ability of this type of information to evoke an emotional reaction in a person. Therefore, destructive memes have become a good tool that can influence the moral, ethical and political agenda, and even change the preferences of voters. Disadaptogenesis, an objective feature in the activity of the human brain, which in some cases triggers destructive processes, can act as a process contributing to this negative influence. At the end of the article, it was concluded that memes, like genes, lead to the transformation of a person, that is, they determine his upward and (or) downward biosociocultural evolution. The results of this study can be used to develop general principles for preventing the spread of destructive memes in society.

DT Article
DE contemporary Japan; Japanese society; ancestor worship; ancestor
   veneration; funerals; commemoration; death studies
AB This article examines the transformation of ancestor worship in the context of socio-political and religious conditions and identifies the characteristics of worship in contemporary Japanese society and the changes in the form of practices and functions of this worship occurring today.
   Ancestor worship is not a phenomenon unique to traditional societies: in 21st century Japan, ancestor worship rituals are practiced by a large part of the population. After World War II, Japanese veneration practices underwent significant changes. The post-war modernization and urbanization of Japanese society played a major role in these changes, leading to the breakdown of the traditional family system. The concept of ancestor itself changes: the concept of ancestor tends to expand and begins to extend bilaterally (to both the husband and wife lines). There has been a transition from the "obligatory" concept of an ancestor, which includes all deceased ancestors in the direct line of succession regardless of personal preferences, to an "optional" one, which limits the concept of "ancestor" to close relatives whose memories are dear to the descendant. With the change in the concept of the ancestor, the functions of ancestor veneration also undergo a transformation: the former functions of veneration rituals contributed to the stability of the ie system, while the new ones consist in relieving psychological tensions between the living and the dead and bringing comfort to particular people. There has been a "privatization" of ancestor veneration, that is, a growing dominance of personal functions in veneration. Diversification of family types, especially pronounced in the first decades of the 21st century, is also reflected in the rites of ancestor veneration: alternatives to traditional funerals and new forms of burial and storage of remains are appearing.
   The article concludes that, despite changes in the functions and forms of ancestor worship, the place given to the dead in their lives by the living remains invariably important. And the individualization of veneration practices and the undying belief of a large part of the Japanese population in the power of ancestor spirits indicate that the ancestor cult in contemporary Japan is apparently at the next stage of its unfolding, but by no means of extinction.

AB The ethnopolitical situation in the North Caucasian communities is characterized by instability, which is caused not only by the socio-economic situation in the region, but also by socio-cultural processes. Recently, in the socio-cultural life of the region, the issues of the memory of history have been actualized in connection with the spread of various cultural meanings manifested in cultural memory, aimed at preserving and reproducing the integrity of the sociocultural organism, and historical memory, which is an ideological reflection of social reality, framed by political interests of ethnic entrepreneurs. The aim of the study is to determine which mechanisms of the reproduction of sociocultural practices, namely, cultural memory and / or historical memory - prevail in the North Caucasian communities. The study revealed the dominance of historical memory as a factor in the dynamics of socio-cultural processes. This results in the formation by each ethno-nation of its "own" historical memory, the use of which leads to an increase of risks for the stability of ethnopolitical situation in the North Caucasus. The conclusion is made about the importance of activating the mechanisms of consolidation in the socio-cultural practice of the North Caucasian communities, and strengthening peace and cooperation between people of different ethnic and religious identity. This can be facilitated by the reorientation of the historical consciousness of the inhabitants of the North Caucasus region from historical to cultural memory.

AB Introduction. The relevance of the study is due to the need to ensure a synergetic effect within the framework of the Union State of Belarus and Russia, to create its positive image as an integration association in internal and external dimensions. The purpose of the study is to identify the specifics of cooperation between the regions of Russia and Belarus in the context of integration priorities of both countries.
   Materials and Methods. The research was based on the traditional study of documents, content analysis, comparative and multilevel analysis. The most important materials arc official documents of Russia and Belarus, publications in the media, expert survey data, statistical information on the dynamics of interregional relations in the Union State. All of them together made it possible to concretize the signs of multifaceted communications in the field under consideration, to identify possible ways to improve the integration policy of the member states of the Union State in the face of escalated challenges and threats.
   Results. The peculiarities of the approaches of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus to the interpretation of interregional cooperation and integration in the format of the Union State are shown. The positions of the border regions are characterized. The content and orientation of media publications of different levels are analyzed, certain vulnerabilities are highlighted. Insufficient degree of interrelation of strategic orientations of integration and interregional interaction is found. The lack of manifestation of conflicting motives is offset by, distancing from substantive coverage and discussion of topical issues, including by regional and local communities.
   Discussion and Conclusion. The performed research shows that the tasks of information support of the Union State, organization of "demand for integration", training of personnel for "integration marketing" at the level of the regions of the two countries and expansion of their communication channels are unsolved. The recommendations made as a result are intended for representatives of state authorities and local self-government bodies and are aimed at improving the current situation through more effective use of existing advantages and mechamsms and the formation of new ones that meet the needs of integrating states and their regions.

AB The article presents results of the analysis of historiographical sources of Russian emigration in order to identify various points of view on assessment of activities during the Civil War of the leaders of two of four largest enclaves of the White Movement: Lieutenant General E. K. Miller in the Northern enclave and Infantry General N. N. Yudenich in the North-Western one. The complex of works of Russian ?migr? authors, consisting mostly of memoirs and several research papers published in the 1920-30s, represent first attempts at a different (non-Soviet) portrayal of the confrontation of the early 20th century, for instance, an anti-Bolshevik view on the factors underlying the defeat of the White Cause. The leadership of the largest anti-Soviet enclaves was listed among these factors. Thus, consideration of publications of the leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party P. N. Milyukov, professional historian, graduate of the Moscow University scientific school; Major General P. A. Tomilov, Commander of the North-Western Army (before Yudenich); Lieutenant General A. A. Rodzianko; G. K. Gins, Russian legal scientist, member of the government of A. V. Kolchak; deputy of the I, III, and IV State Dumas N.N. Lviv, public figure and journalist, who reported on political issues at press conferences of N. N. Yudenich, G. L. Kirdetsov (Dvorzhetsky); and others permits to implement the principle of objectivity in historical research, but also to highlight the views of ?migr? authors on issues relating to the White Movement enclaves' leaders implementing their authority. The article notes that the said historiographical sources indicate to such negative features in the activities of Generals Miller and Yudenich during the Civil War as indecision, passivity, inability (or, possibly, unwillingness) to rally anti-Bolshevik forces against the Soviets and to organize positive military administration work on the occupied territory, which hampered formation of strong White dictatorship in the regions. The analyzed sources argue that only White dictatorship during the Civil War could have effectively resisted the authoritarian power of the opposite camp, the dictatorship of the Red. However, in the works of ?migr? authors, there is also an opposing opinion, that cooperation was much needed between the military authorities and democratic civil authorities, for example, the government of the North. The article states that studying of this complex set of sources should take into account the peculiarities of their creation: authors' personal attitudes to the events of the Civil War and its participants (sometimes biased), their lack of professional historical skills, narrowness of the source base. Thus, any further research should include comparative analysis of the data of historiographical sources of the Russian emigration and contributions of other historiographical trends.

LA English
DT Article
DE Germany; World War I; gender history; ?home front?; working women;
   emancipation
AB This article attempts to study the process of gender roles transformation of German women under the influence of World War I. Gender history as a social history of the sexes has significant heuristic potential which is why the author uses it as a methodological basis of the research. The recent years have seen an increased interest in war history, the front, and the rear from the gender point of view among researchers. The gender perspective - precisely because it has long remained outside the mainstream - has challenged and fundamentally changed the contemporary historiography of German history. Gender studies demonstrate that debates about war and peace are always also discussions of the gendered social order, or the ideas of "masculinity" and "femininity" at a certain time. For a long time, in historiography, the opinion prevailed that World War I was a decisive factor in the emancipation of women in Germany in the twentieth century. However, studies of the last two decades have convincingly shown that this thesis needs to be corrected at least. The increase in the share of female labour in German industry during the war years corresponded to the pre-war trend and did not exceed it in quantitative terms. Women's labour in the industry was the lot of the lower classes. Measures of social support of the state for the families of military personnel, on the one hand, contributed to women's financial independence, and, on the other hand, increased their dependence on it, formed dependents. The inability of the German authorities during the war years to provide for the basic life needs of the population le d to widespread illegal activities (larceny, illegal markets) and protests, which together with the military defeat, became one of the main reasons for the November Revolution.

DE conscious; unconscious; spontaneous; organized
AB In Russian philosophical reflection, the concepts "spontaneous" and "unconscious" in social processes are often identified, which leads to two undesirable consequences. Firstly, such an interpretation leads to an expansive interpretation of the spontaneous, as a result of which the definition denotes a class of heterogeneous phenomena. Secondly, the identification of the spontaneous and the unconscious leads to the ignoring of the concept of the social unconscious in Russian science. Explication of the spontaneous and the conscious as opposites logically means their definition through the dichotomous properties inherent in the oppositional side. Being more complex, the correlation of the spontaneous and the conscious is not reduced to their elementary opposition. Although spontaneity does not exclude some constants of the conscious, their presence is not enough to avoid disorganization, disorder of the course of social processes. The lack of a sufficient degree of awareness of the social subject undoubtedly leads to spontaneity. However, this fact does not mean that the concept "consciousness" is opposed to the concept "spontaneity" in the categorical sense. Such an opposition means mixing categorical analysis with empirical statements. It seems appropriate to define spontaneous as a form of social activity characterized by an insufficient level of planning, organization, and control over the course of activities. It is these properties that are the criterion for distinguishing between spontaneous and non-spontaneous, in contrast to the traditional pair of categories "spontaneous" and "conscious". In the author's opinion, it is legitimate to define the spontaneous through the opposition of organization, the conscious through the opposition of the unconscious. The following point indicates the logic of such a comparison of concepts. The conscious and the unconscious represent the spiritual sphere of being, organization and spontaneity include both the ideal beginning and the material and practical one. It follows from this that "conscious" and "spontaneous" are diverse concepts, as a result of which they are not conjugate categories. Thus, the distinction between the concepts "spontaneous" and "unconscious" not only helps to clarify their relationship with the related categories "organized" and "conscious", but also has heuristic significance, indicating the grounds for distinguishing the concept of the social unconscious as a separate subject of research.

AB The article analyzes the genesis and internal structure of the "soil" concept in the works of F. M. Dostoevsky and of various Slavophiles: A. S. Khomyakov, I. V. Kireevsky, Yu. F. Sama-rin, and other writers in the sphere of Dostoevsky's interests in 1850-1870: A. I. Herzen, A. A. Grigoriev, N. N. Strakhov, Archimandrite Theodore (A. M. Bukharev), and others. The author traces the conditions under which the magazine Vre my a was created and explores why the ideology of "pochvennichestvo" was unclear to the Russian public, including some of its supporters (N. N. Strakhov). The author assumes that this idea can be traced from early let-ters to brother Mikhail (1838), to the "Pushkin Speech" (1880), and to the novel The Brothers Karamazov. The author criticizes claims about a new unwritten novel dedicated to the further path of Alyosha Karamazov, where, according to the "Diary" of A. S. Suvorin, he would have become a revolutionary. The author concludes that there is a deep unity linking Dostoevsky's ideal of "pochvennichestvo" and the root idea of his literary work, which can be defined as mental searching for an answer to the question of the meaning of life, with the assertion of a direct dependence between moral state of a human being and his religious - ontological position

DE the poem "The Grand Inquisitor" ("The Brothers Karamazov" by F.M.
   Dostoevsky); Archimandrite Theodore (A.M. Bukharev); Creative History;
   Allusion and Reminiscence
AB The article suggests that the chapter "The Grand Inquisitor" in F.M. Dostoevsky's novel "The Brothers Karamazov", which raises the question of the necessity/undesirability of strict administration in the field of church and social life, is a reflection of the views of Archimandrite Theodore (A.M. Bukharev), for his protests against the infringement of the human right to choose a religious model and social freedom subjected to bullying by conservative circles. In a number of his books throughout the 1860s Bukharev insisted on the need to abandon authoritarianism, he questioned the inviolability of church dogmas in favor of a free spiritual search of a person not constrained by restrictions. Contemporaries, including A.I. Herzen, commenting on this issue, spoke of Bukharev's persecutors from the Synod and the "Domashnaya beseda" magazine (The Home Conversation) as "inquisitors" who dealt with the philosopher in the same way as the Spanish religious police did. Bukharev's main idea was the need for the country and the whole world to move from the generally accepted Old Testament model of political and trade relations between people based on the idea of "an eye for an eye" to benevolent positive ties based on the principle of brotherly love, commanded by Jesus Christ. Dostoevsky laid this idea at the foundation of the ideology of "pochvennichestvo", as was reported in the "Announcement" about the publication of the magazine "Time", the organ of the socio-cultural project created by him. The motives and the basic structure of Bukharev's logic, the idea of the saving power of Christian love, were used by Dostoevsky in all his works written after Bukharev's death. It was used with the greatest force in the novel "The Brothers Karamazov" for modern readers at the level of hidden allusion, and for contemporaries it was done in the form of an open allusion.

   work; source studies
AB Introduction. Writing, as a special sign system, provides a link between the past and the present is one of the main ways of transmitting cultural tradition. This article deals with a special form of clerical work in Medieval Russia - scrolls and columns. Materials. A column with a border is a narrow strip of paper, about 1617 cm wide and up to 45 cm long, or 14-15 cm wide and up to 35 cm long. They were glued together along a narrow edge with each other, resulting in documents up to several tens of meters long - columns. Such documents were kept twisted, in scrolls. Analysis. In the second half of the 15th century, the Grand ducal chancery became the center of administrative power. There were a transformation and development of clerical work in it. The conducted research suggests that the appearance of the column form of clerical work was due to political, socio-economic and cultural reasons. The appearance of the columns dates back to the second half of the 15th century. The disappearance of the column form of clerical work occurred in 1700-1702. Peter I initiated a revolution in clerical work by ordering to switch to conducting business in a notebook form. The innovation did not spread immediately; the old traditions of document processing were preserved in the monasteries for several years. Results. The appearance of the columnar form of clerical work coincided with the emergence of a single centralized state under Ivan III, the increasing importance of the clerical apparatus. The disappearance was due to the reforms of Peter I, the formation of the Russian Empire and the replacement of orders by colleges. It is obvious that the emergence and disappearance of such a specific form of office work are associated with large-scale national changes.

DE State Council; Senate; oath; interregnum; abdication; Nicholas I;

AB The article is devoted to the activities of the highest state body of the Russian Empire during the interregnum of 1825. The political crisis changed the institutional status of the State Council. His position in the system of power during this period was not based on legislative acts, it depended on the position of the time-honored Senate and was determined by the tasks of the plan for Nikolai Pavlovich's coming to power. It is shown that during the meeting on November 27, the members supported the initiative of Nicholas to swear allegiance to Constantine, but included in the official protocol an unacceptable formula of his abdication. Senate completely ignored the decision of the Council. This circumstance was perceived as normative and natural. The decisive meeting of the State Council took place on the night of December 13-14, but it is difficult to identify bureaucratic logic in this event. Nikolai gathered the members of the Council, read out a manifesto to them and, without requiring an oath, sent them home. For all the actors of these events, the key was the oath of the Senate. All this gives reason to conclude that the State Council was only the proscenium of the political struggle of the period of the interregnum, a theatrical performance that served for Nicholas as a source of information about the moods of the highest dignitaries. He made all the key decisions on his own, coordinating them only with his confidants, and implemented them through the decisions of the Senate.

AB Introduction. The article explores the process and circumstances of understanding war as a political phenomenon in Soviet Russia 1917-1922, describes their impact on practice and theory development. For this purpose, the author studies the related political and ideological circumstances, characterizes the theory of class warfare and shows the specifics of understanding of the link between war and politics. Methodology and research methods. The methodology is based on political realism and the recognition of war as a complex, volatile and contradictory political phenomenon. The article identifies the causality between the attitudes of the Soviet leadership, political practice and theoretical approaches to the study of war, taking into account real political situations, processes and decisions. Analysis. The study of war as a political phenomenon took place in the context of policy impact of the ideology and doctrinal principles of the state. Two approaches have emerged in the development of the theory of war. The first was characterized by a pronounced ideological perception of the war. The second approach was marked by the recognition of the political nature and determination of war, while avoiding the discussion on the mechanism of implementation of Soviet political institutions into military theory and practice. Under these conditions, the synthesis of the two research paradigms was impossible. As a result, the first approach that didn't recognize the existence of alternative points of view in the study of war began to prevail. Results. In the early years of Soviet power, the scientific study of war turned out to be secondary in relation to the official ideological and doctrinal guidelines, which eventually began to formulate the comprehension of war as a political phenomenon. This situation, with minor changes, remained in the subsequent decades, which had consequences for the country's defense and the use of military force.

AB This paper describes the history of the spread of Western educational models in India and Japan in the second half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Transformation of education, both in its organizational structure and contents, was an important part of the modernization processes in these countries. Despite the obvious similarities, modernization of education in India and Japan differed significantly, due to the social, cultural and political circumstances. In India, Western educational practices were initially introduced by British colonial authorities for the sake of training civil servants. Later on, their spread was supported by Indian nationalists who considered education an intrinsic part of the campaign for independence. In Japan, the main impetus to reforming the educational system was given by the new government, with an accent on the primary and secondary education. To modernize it the government decided to adopt elements of different Western educational systems most befitting to Japanese customs. This produced impressive results, but under the influence of the strengthening nationalistic and militarist sentiments at the end of the 19th century educational priorities changed, shifting to the traditional Confucian values, which in the end led to transforming school into the analogue of the preparatory phase before entering the army.

AB The article aims to identify and analyze the manifestations of the crisis in the American political system in the context of the 2020 presidential election and the political situation that preceded it. To achieve this aim, the author uses systemic, institutional, and comparative methods of analysis, as well as political analysis itself. The 2020 US presidential election became one of the most striking resonant events in world politics, accentuating the presence of a serious and deep crisis in the American political and electoral systems. The polarization of society and the electorate, the growing distrust of citizens in the electoral mechanisms and in the political class of the country were, among other things, a consequence of the tough and contrasting campaign carried out by the two main candidates for the presidency. The BLM movement and the mobilization of supporters of left-liberal values, on the one hand, and the phenomenon of Trump's populism, coupled with two attempts to impeach and seize the Capitol by his supporters at the very end of his presidential term, on the other, became a confirmation of the deep division of American society and politics. Ultimately, the crisis of the US political system includes a number of more specific crises: (1) The crisis of American citizens' confidence in the political system as a whole, because within the framework of the "agenda" formulated by politicians, the tasks of the country's long-term development in the interests of the majority of its citizens are not set and not solved. (2) The crisis of confidence in the political establishment as a whole, which is turning into a kind of a "political corporation" that systematically reproduces itself, and is less and less responsive to the real needs of voters and citizens. (3) The crisis of political parties, which are often unable to effectively control the electorate and consolidate society in a situation of emerging challenges and a demand for change. (4) The crisis of party platforms and ideologies: a significant part of American society lacks trust in them, and the programmatic and ideological differences between the two main parties are no longer so obvious, which disorients the electorate and creates additional space for the activities of political populists and radicals of various kinds. (5) The crisis of the electoral mechanism, connected with the fact that it does not ensure the representation of the interests of various strata of society, is considered as archaic and imperfect by professional politicians and voters. (6) The crisis of unity in values and ideology in American society. (7) The crisis of the institution of elections: voters regularly distrust the reliability of election results, which casts doubt on the legitimacy of the electoral institutions. Thus, in the case of the United States, during the 2020 presidential campaign, there was a combination (overlap) of crises of legitimacy, trust, and manageability on the scale of the national political system, which confirmed the existence of a complex crisis of the latter.

ID RUSSIA
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of a special political form that arises in the "empty space" on the "edge of the state", where actors of power exist remotely, beyond the boundaries of the "emptiness", but they can be materialized in it. The authors use the term "periphery of power" to describe this political form. The article shows that "empty space" is not a va-cuum, but it does not contain what the observer (in this case, the authorities) expects to see, what he can read and comprehend as some kind of entity. It is the absence of the expected objects, actors and practices that makes the space "empty".
   The paper verifies the hypothesis that, being "empty" for an observer, such space is populated and has authorities. Empirically, the study is based on the results of two field works to the upper Lena River. The territory has neither settlement structure nor legal economic activity, and the number of registered residents is minimal. The nearest authorities (police, environmen-tal protection, municipal authorities, etc.) are located on the borders of the territory, and the distance to the nearest large city (Irkutsk) is 500-700 km. Nevertheless, the field work there revealed a fairly large community with its own hierarchy, stable forms of communication, legalization and mobiliza-tion of remote authorities. For members of this community, staying in the "empty territory" makes no sense from the economic point of view. They are registered in other places (district centers or other regional cities, includ-ing capitals) and represent relatively successful citizens. However, the city remains for them nothing else but a source of resources (material, financial, etc.). They live exactly in the "empty space". Social networks are formed in it, statuses and communication are built, which can be turned into the space of power.
   The insights that the authors obtained give ground to assume that this process is not an outlier, but rather represented a more general process of sepa-rating a place to earn money and a place to live. According to their conclusion, while maintaining the current trends, the "exit space" documented by them will expand, forming more and more new forms of "emptiness".

AB When implementing national projects, there is an issue of the expert group formation due to the need in new management mechanisms that meet the meritocratic demand of the Russian society for an effective state under the transition from the "control and supervision" paradigm to the "smart management" paradigm. National projects should not be left out of the wider public discussion and real participation of different target groups, which is determined by the tasks of the power-administrative vertical - to answer external and internal challenges in the implementation of 12 national projects. The result of the established expert group formation is the structure of decision-making groups. To identify the effect of group formation, the authors introduce the parameter `cohesion'-`disagreement' in expert groups during the development and implementation of project solutions. The study aims at assessing the state of expert groups (decision-making), which reflect the level of the regional development, including social-cultural modernization. On the basis of the presented theoretical-methodological foundations, the authors developed a methodology for identifying socio-mental groups that are formed in the decision-making groups and work on the implementation of national projects. This methodology consists of the scales of experts' access to the regional management (index "activity vs passivity") and the scales of solidarity of experts with the position of power, political and managerial activities of all levels of the power-administrative vertical (index "support vs disagreement"). The structures of the expert groups were correlated with the integral indices of the regional development as presented in the social-economic and political-administrative rankings. Thus, on the basis of statistical procedures and identified expert groups, the authors assessed the `disagreement' and `cohesion' of expert decision-making in achieving national goals.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE World War I; Caucasian front; Russo-Turkish War; Eastern question;
   Constantinople; Straits; Russian press
AB The article examines the development of the image of Turkey in the Russian press in 1914-1918. Perceiving the Ottoman Empire as a minor power with a weak army, Russian newspapers and magazines took into account the great strategic and political significance of the new Russian-Turkish war in solving Russia's "historical tasks" in the Black and Mediterranean Seas. Periodicals of different orientations assessed the significance of the new Russian-Turkish war in different ways. For the conservative press, this was primarily the return of the "cross to St. Sophia", the return of the Orthodox tsar to Constantinople. The liberal press paid more attention to the economic opportunities from the capture of the Straits. However, for both of them, the victory in the war was perceived as a natural result of the Russian-Turkish confrontation and symbolized the final "expulsion" of Turkey from Europe. In a broader sense, this meant the expulsion of Aziatchina [Asianism] from the "civilization" area. This reasoning was facilitated by major victories on the Caucasian Front (as opposed to the main front in Europe) and regular reports from official sources (Petrograd Telegraph Agency, General Staff) about the socio-economic and political crisis in the Ottoman Empire. The condescending attitude, the underestimation of the combat capability of the Turkish army and Turkey's resistance to a protracted war prevailed. In many ways, therefore, the Caucasian Front remained secondary, although victory in this theater made it possible to open the Straits and receive large consignments of weapons and ammunition from the Western allies. In 1917, the "dream of Tsargrad," tacitly proclaimed as the main goal of Russia in the world war, became one of the key factors in the political crisis. In the socialist press, Constantinople and the Straits became the personification of Russian imperialism and the cause of the deaths of millions of soldiers, the impoverishment of the people, and the depletion of the economy. Against this background, the image of Turkey underwent tangible changes. The conservative press developed the image of Turkey as an "Eastern despotism," a historically doomed autocracy. In fact, it became a new ideological frame for the old military goals of Russia in the world war. The social democratic press turned more to the suffering of ordinary Turks, who were forced to shed blood for goals they did not know. The commonality of the fate of the Turkish and Russian peoples in their long and difficult struggle with the autocracy for the establishment of democracy was emphasized. The economic and political crisis in Russia actually led the second point of view to victory, which influenced the general course of the Russian Revolution.

DE bureaucracy; business; corruption; corruption risks
AB The article deals with the analysis of the political-economical origin of corruption, corruption risks and the role of the state in emancipation of business from corruption. The reasons defining the objective nature of corruption and corruption risks are given on the basis of competition marking business by the extent of the recourse to administrative factors as well as by the part of the state in countering corruption risks and corruptive emancipation of business. Like the defense mechanism for business the state in the face of competition doesn't cope with the shielding any business caught in a difficult economic situation without standing the competition. Specifically the state triggers off higher competition because of the negligence to interests of any certain business or entire industries. If the necessity in corruption is predetermined by business also the suggestions from business are predetermined by civil servants who are ready to support this necessity notably to their greatest advantage. The concept of corruption is defined as objective peculiarity of the modern society, as the result of competition specifying by commodity and money relations. Corruption itself sets the direction of corruption risks identification. Arising from competition, corruption risks constitute a prospective of entering of political-economic agents into a form of commodity and money relations resulting in purchase-sale of goods ineligible to be privatized on political, moral and traditional grounds. The necessity of reexamination of laws in the part of their influence business needs to ignore the law is given in the findings. The state should be greatly approved in its striving to facilitate relations with business, to remove barriers in formation and to support favorable reproduction. All this leads to emancipation of business which in turn provides more acceptable climate for reproduction and hence reduces the demand for private services of civil servants.

AB In the introduction part of the article the authors give a proof of the topicality issue, define the goal and formulate the problem of the research. As prerequisites for the formation of new educational shifts, large-scale economic and cultural changes are singled out, where the key role is played by the close relationship between thinking and creativity of the subjects of the educational process. According to the authors, the lack of universal - philosophical and methodological - foundations in the construction of a thinking model, including one focused on creating a creative result, does not correspond to the guidelines for the development of modern education. So, the main question that the authors answer is: what is the actualized model of thinking in education that allows to form a creative result in the form of both new and already existing knowledge aimed at solving problems for which traditional methods do not work? To answer the above question, a logical-cognitive approach to the study of thinking was used and emphasis was placed on the actual analysis of the process, structure, elements and levels of mental operations, the result of which is a creative product. The foundation of thinking is a logical pole, manifested in a contradiction, the resolution of which is possible due to a clear fixation (including verbal) of real opposites within the same object under study, and in a logical analysis designed to create such a sign system that would clarify the structure of any language. As a distinctive element of the model of thinking in education, the creation of ideal conceptual images is highlighted, which includes such traditional stages as focusing, processing, choosing and evaluating. However, already at the first stage, the focus is not so much on the object (context, assessment of current barriers), but on the relationship of a person to the object (functional and semantic load). At the intersection of abstract and objective thinking, unique and non-standard solutions with different qualitative characteristics emerge. In conclusion, the authors summarize the results and formulate a conclusion.

DE Russian philosophy; Berdyaev; war; evil; Russian idea
AB N.A. Berdyaev repeatedly turned to the war theme throughout his creative life. His reflections about the war supplemented, elaborated, deepened various interconnected and superimposed fundamental existential problems and, first of all, the problem of presence of evil in the world. Berdyaev considered war, par excellence, as a phenomenon of spiritual order, as a fact of inconsistent and bifurcated spiritual reality. The Russian thinker analyzed war in ontological, ethical, anthropological contexts. The depth and versatility of this analysis allow to speak about Berdyaev's philosophy of war. The article traces the development of Berdyaev's ideas concerning the nature and character of war, the influence of war on the person and society. Already in his early works an idealized image of the knight as an embodiment of the noble human type, as an alternative to the bourgeois vulgarity and philistinism is formed. In the beginning of the First World War he writes a lot about the positive influence of war on the formation of national consciousness, on actualization of the person as a necessary condition of realization by the nation of its own global historic mission. Berdyaev believes in the great historic mission of Russia - to become a connecting link between the East and the West, to unite two streams of world history. However, gradually he leaves these illusions. Berdyaev connects degradation of Russia and Russian people with war and the revolution which followed it. In modern war he sees the mass carnage deprived of positive sense, the powerful factor of people's dehumanization and depersonalization, collective hypnosis. The Russian thinker concludes that "mechanization" of war leads to the negation of the person. Modern totalitarian war cancels the positive effects of former wars and becomes absolute evil.

AB Introduction. The events in Ukraine in 2013-2014 contributed to the manifestation of the Ukrainian political crisis, which led to the secession of the Crimean Peninsula, the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. The new Ukrainian authorities, realizing the impossibility of returning the Crimea, launched a military operation against the DPR and LPR, the so-called "ATO". The general civil confrontation between Kiev on the one hand and Donetsk and Luhansk on the other hand led to the beginning of the civil war in Ukraine, the fact of which is not recognized by the Ukrainian authorities, but is presented as "Russian aggression". Methods. Through institutional analysis, the study identifies approaches to understanding the factor of the civil war in Ukraine. Analysis. The participants of the armed confrontation, both on the part of Ukraine, and on the part of the DPR and LPR, are Ukrainian citizens. The fact that there are a significant number of Russian citizens among the militia, primarily from among the Cossacks, is due to the historical unity of the lands of the pre-revolutionary Region of the Don Army, socio-cultural and blood-related factors. The participation of the Cossacks in the conflict is of particular importance in the context of Ukraine's positioning itself as a "Cossack country". An important place in the understanding of the military confrontation is occupied by the transnationalization of political elites for the post-Soviet space, which acts as an impulse for the unity of the population of the former USSR. In a civil war, there is no boundary dividing the parties on civilizational, ethnic and linguistic grounds. But at the same time, some authors highlight the factor of regional identity. Results. Approaches to the definition of the civil war in Ukraine are revealed. The reluctance of the perception of the concept of "civil war" by the Ukrainian authorities is determined. The assessment of the further development of the civil war in the country is given.

AB : The Byzantine Empire has existed longer than all the empires that were on Earth - more than 1000 years. She created the << Byzantine Commonwealth >> of countries (D. D. Obolensky's term), stretching from the South Baltic to the Mediterranean and from the Adriatic Sea to the Caucasus Mountains. The Commonwealth countries had religious and cultural unity, a close political culture and a similar tragic fate. All of them fell victim to foreign conquest, from the Mongols to the Ottomans, and with great difficulty, centuries later, regained their sovereignty. With the death of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, its historical role did not stop. Byzantium remained a relevant historical actor for a long time, as an ideal and as a symbol, as a heritage and as a hope for the revival of its former greatness. It is not for nothing that the ideas of << lasting Rome >>, << New Constantinople >>, etc., were so popular. According to the Romanian historian Nicolae Iorga, the time of << Byzantium after Byzantium >> has come, which continues to this day. In the article, historians, specialists in the history of Byzantium, consider the following questions: 1) What is << Byzantium after Byzantium >>? Is it an symbolic image, is it a historical memory of a bygone empire, is it a political, spiritual, cultural ideal? Or is it a fictitious concept, Byzantium died in 1453? 2) How long did << Byzantium after Byzantium >> exist? What is the chronological depth of Byzantine influence in the Balkans, in Eastern Europe? 3) There is a point of view about the << unfavorable heritage >> of Byzantium - all countries belonging to the << Byzantine Commonwealth >> have a difficult historical fate. Is this a fatal coincidence, or the negative influence of the << Byzantine heritage >>? 4) Did Byzantium have a successor (cultural, political, spiritual)? To what extent can they consider Russia, the Balkan states?

AB Solomon Maimon (1753-1800), one of the most significant Jewish philosophers of modem times, in his writings tried to critically approach the tradition of Jewish thought and compare its teachings with the views of European philosophers. In recent decades, he and his views have attracted close attention of historians of philosophy. Recently, seven volumes of his works were published in Russia, translated from German and Hebrew. One of his most famous books is his Lebensgeschichte (Autobiography), an autobiography written by him in the 1790s and revealing both the stages of his life path and spiritual development, as well as his understanding of various problems of philosophy, religion, ethics and mysticism. This book has enjoyed a reputation as a classic in the genre of "intellectual biography" for two centuries. The article discusses the main features of this book, as well as its perception in the 19th - early 20th centuries. The stereotypical image of Maimon as a freethinker Jew, a fighter against religious superstitions and social inequality, almost overshadowed his significance as an original philosopher, whose views were appreciated by I. Kant and J.G. Fichte. This attitude towards Maimon was fully reflected in the translations of his Autobiography. Our article pays special attention to the Russian translations of this book. We are publishing for the first time documents related to an attempt to publish in the 1930s a complete commented translation of Maimon's book. Famous Soviet philosophers and translators participated in the preparation of this translation (Boris G. Stolpner, Isaak M. Alter, and others), but the book was never published for political reasons.

AB The Internet provides ample opportunities for spreading radical ideas and influencing public opinion. The study of information strategies of extremist and terrorist movements and the development of effective countermanipulative mechanisms for society are among the most important scientific problems of our time. The authors, using content analysis and comparative analysis, investigated the information strategy of radicals on the Internet in relation to the conducting of a special military operation of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation on the territory of a neighboring state in 2022. Two hundred Internet materials with signs of propaganda of terrorist and extremist ideas were identified during observations in February-April 2022. They became the basis for conducting content analysis on 11 signs and for constructing matrices. Topics of religious extremism, neo-fascism and nationalism predominate in the array of materials under consideration. The preferred style of writing extremist texts is informational (the author, as it were, informs the reader of some kind of " news," while using the actual informational occasion only in a small proportion of publications). The data obtained were compared with the results and information strategies of radicals obtained during a study in 2020 (widespread quarantine measures due to the spread of COVID-19). Similar and different features of the transformation of information strategies of extremists on the Internet were found. Typical features of both periods of crisis are the widespread dissemination of extremist materials, the growth in the number of aggressive comments in relation to state institutions and individual nationalities. The key difference was the sharp increase in the volume of Russophobic texts, the formation of enclaves of extremist communities outside social networks - based on neutral sites (electronic libraries, for example). The content analysis has shown an expansion of aggressive practices among older (40+) people, a formation of a distorted reality through special platforms in such a way that an alternative point of view is excluded from the information agenda of Runet.

DE scientific perspectivism; realism; antirealism; Ronald Giere; Michela
   Massimi; Francois Recanati
AB The current state of philosophy of science is characterized by stasis in the struggle between realism and antirealism. In recent years, a number of authors have come out with a program of scientific perspectivism that claims to sublate this great collision and gain the status of a new epistemological paradigm: "perspectivism, or, better, perspectival realism, is one of the newest attempts to find a middle ground between scientific realism and antirealism" [1. P. 2]. Important milestones of the perspective movement were the works of Ronald Giere, Francois Recanati, Bas van Fraassen, Michela Massimi, and others. The thesis of the article is that perspectivism has not yet realized its claims to autonomy, although it has become an important new arena for discussions between realists and antirealists who try to appropriate perspectivist concepts and arguments. The "middle ground," when thought out consistently and thoroughly, turns out to lie not "between," but either in the territory of realism or in the territory of antirealism, depending on the presumptions of the author of a particular perspectivist conception. This is demonstrated by the analysis of the conceptions of Giere, Massimi, and Recanati. Giere's perspectivism is based on the metaphor of color vision, and for him only some (secondary) qualities of real objects turn out to be perspectival, i.e., subject-dependent. Massimi's perspectivism attempts, on the basis of a visual arts metaphor, to combine the phenomenon of the plurality of scientific theories ("perspectival disagreement" about what an object is) with the general realist attitude of science (agreement about that there is an object). Recanati's perspectivism syncretizes realism about ordinary objects and relativism about other things. The first two versions of perspectivism rely on a perceptual metaphor: perspective is conditioned by the perceptual constitution of the observer, that is, it arises at the mental or cognitive level. Recanati's version attempts to derive perspective from contextuality, that is, it is semantic. However, it does not show exactly how perceptual categories are superimposed on theories or how scientific concepts reveal their perspectival character. The isomorphism of perception and theoretical thinking, sensibility and understanding, remains undemonstrated. On the one hand, perspectivist efforts are motivated by an important concern to account for antirealist critique (lack of access to the " view from nowhere," factual and semantic underdetermination, difficulties with the idea of approaching the truth, the historicity of knowledge, the activeness of the constructing subject, etc.) while preserving the scientific commitment to universality, validity, and truthfulness. On the other hand, the ontological question remains fundamental and unavoidable, and perspectivism (yet?) fails to circumvent it. As we see, all three versions of perspectivism considered in this article turn out to be varieties of realism: Giere and Massimi recognize this explicitly, while Recanati de facto assumes a quite respectable and conservative position of selective realism with respect to ordinary objects.

AB Based on the archival documents and the works of Russian kavkazologists, the article attempts to study the strategy of Russian national policy in the Caucasus. The purpose of the study is to show the place and role of one of the leaders of the Russian military administration in Dagestan Commandant A.T. Junger as well as to identify his rights and powers as the head of the Russian military administration in Derbent. The research material is based on the archival documents of the 18th century (RGADA, RGVIA, RGAVMF) which are stored in the Russian archives and most of which are introduced into the scientific circulation for the first time. Furthermore, the achievements of Russian historians on the problem under study are widely used. The basic principles of scientific objectivity and historicism are used, involving the study of historical facts and events in the specific historical conditions with a focus on the development and interdependence of historical events as well as multivariation of the historical process. Leaving Derbent, Emperor Peter I entrusted all the management of affairs to the appointed commandant. According to his plan, the fullness of military, civil, and political power was concentrated in the hands of the commandant of Derbent, both in the fortress itself and in its district many miles away from it. The duties of the commandant also included the management of the garrison located in the fortress, supervision of order, tranquility in the fortress and outside it, and the protection of the city from the enemy. Its jurisdiction also included financial, economic, administrative and political functions. Using the identified historical sources, it was revealed that the commandant A.T. Junger, entering into negotiations with local feudal rulers, personified a representative of the government of the Russian Empire.

DT Article
DE EU; Spain; Catalonia; nationalism; separatism; independence; security;
   autonomy; mechanisms; crisis
AB The Catalan crisis raises deep concerns about the very nature of European democracy. This is no longer an internal affair of Spain - rather a European and global crisis. Brussels, having declared that the Catalan problem is an internal affair of Spain, cannot completely abstract from it, both for economic and political reasons. It is quite obvious that the Spanish political elite failed to come up with an attractive alternative for Catalonia, or even a basis for a positive dialogue. By decisively taking the side of Madrid after the unilateral declaration of independence, the European Union has caused great disappointment among the Catalan nationalists. The EU is "tired" of crises and seeks to avoid involvement where possible, and it also lacks political or legal tools to resolve separatist-related problems. The European Union turned out to be unprepared for the Catalan crisis politically and intellectually. An extensive network of the EU authorities in the field of crisis management has shown its ineffectiveness. The example of Catalonia clearly demonstrates that the issue of separatism in general poses a serious threat to the European Union and the future of European integration. This threat is twofold. The rise of separatism in Catalonia led to a deep constitutional and political crisis in Spain itself, superimposed on economic problems, especially aggravated during the pandemic. The fourth EU economy is faced with an acute problem of maintaining territorial integrity. The Catalan crisis demonstrated the inability of Brussels to resolve this kind of conflict with mechanisms at its disposal. New mechanisms are needed that can ensure an optimal balance between supranational, state and local government institutions. The events in Catalonia have clearly demonstrated that separatist movements can pose no less a threat to integration as such recognized challenges as terrorism, migration, climate change and cybersecurity. Crises emerging within the European Union have become a serious obstacle to further integration; consequently, the focus of the EU's anti-crisis policy is gradually shifting from external problems to internal ones.

ID HISTORICAL EPISTEMOLOGY; DEMARCATION
AB The topic of the boundaries of science has been discussed in diverse variations. However, understanding the historicity of forms of scientific rationality, relativization and changes in the ways scientific knowledge is produced, and changes in the relationship between science and society inevitably lead to the need to address the problem of the identity of science and to identify the cognitive and social foundations of the slippage of its boundaries. The idea of the boundaries of science depends on the model of science adopted, on its specific historical localization, and on the choice of its aspect of consideration. Science is studied in three main dimensions: science as a system of knowledge, which is characterized by a constant pursuit of truth; science as an activity; and science as a social institution that regulates the relationship between the scientific community, society, and nature. The post-positivist philosophy of science has developed two main aspects of the study of science: cognitive (intra-scientific parameters of the growth of scientific knowledge, internal boundaries) and social and cultural (the relationship of science with other social institutions, external boundaries). It is advisable to consider the problem of boundaries of science by specifying the contexts in which models of science are formed, and depending on the image of science that is "grasped" in this particular dimension of science as a complex self-developing system of knowledge and social and cultural phenomenon, to present ways of identifying science. Thus, for example, the images of science reconstructed by historical epistemology are actively discussed. Another context for the discussion of the boundaries of science is formed around the problem of the relativization of scientific knowledge. Equally important is the context of the emergence of transdisciplinary studies of technoscience. The sociology of scientific knowledge forms the context of " boundary-work" designated by Thomas F. Gieryn. The problem of boundary-work also affects the problems of the method of describing and defining science. Under conditions of inter- and transdisciplinarity and complex thinking the boundaries are erased, and the justification of the demarcation between "science" and " non-science" is questioned. These modern contexts actualize the concept o"boundaries of science", which requires a new philosophical and methodological reading.

TI THE ROLE OF THE NATURAL LAW CONCEPT AS AN ARGUMENT IN CONTEMPORARY

DE ethics of technoscience; convergent technologies; human nature; natural

AB Convergent technologies, which are the most important component of technoscience, open up to the humankind the possibilities of evolution as a consciously guided process of human nature transformation. The issue of the posthuman future of civilization is being discussed under the influence of the NBIC technologies' achievements. The aim of the article is to draw attention to the fact that the natural law norms represent an important argument in the discussion of the most urgent problem of the preservation of human nature - an important aspect of technoscience's ethical discourse. Since knowledge in technoscience is not merely a theoretical product of intellectual activity, but also a form of social practices, the assessment of this knowledge requires a more holistic sociological understanding of knowledge as such. For example, human enhancement technologies potentially form the basis for the transformation of human biological nature, which is the ontological foundation of sociality and culture as an environment for human life. The transformation of biological nature will inevitably lead to a change or even destruction of traditional cultural values. By analogy with the principle of reverence for life, we propose to be guided by the principle of reverence for a human being, drawing on the natural right of every person, including representatives of future generations, to be born with the biological nature of a human being. Based on the idea of the intrinsic purpose of natural law to implement the principles of equality, freedom, and justice in society, which generally contributes to the humanization of social life, we consider natural law as a "meta-right", which is not only a certain conceptual system and the most important mechanism of social interaction, but also a normative criterion for evaluating technoscience projects. The prohibition imposed by the natural right to alienate the biological nature of a person is the ability of a person to preserve their identity as a basis for their progressive development and humanization of social life in all its spheres. The article shows that the concept of natural law can be used as an important argument in discussing the problem of preserving human identity, actualized by the challenges of techno-science.

   Project
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE patrimonial monarchy; patrimonial; final "enslavement of estates";
   westernization; overcoming the Middle Ages
AB The article studies Peter the Great"revolutionary" westernization project of Russia by reviewing the most significant differences in the socio-cultural system of Russia centuries compared to its Western European counterparts in the second half of the 15th - early 18th century. The first part of the article identifies the distinctive features of the socio-cultural system of Russia, which the observers from the Western European saw as the most different from the "correct" European norms and institutions in the second half of the 15th-16th centuries. The most distinctive feature was the concentration in the hands of the Moscow sovereign not only of the state political power but also the property rights on all the country's resources. It resulted in the development of the public sphere in Russia along the line of "sovereign vs slaves", which precluded the Renaissance Western political thought"to accept" Russia into "Europe".
   The author examines two main Western description of Muscovy (Muscovia) in the 15th - 17th centuries: a benevolent approach adopted by Johannes Fabry, Paolo Giovio, Alberto Campense; and a critical approach taken by most authors analyzing Muscovy (Matvey Mekhovsky, Sigismund Herberstein, etc.). These two approaches were also reflected in the dispute between the jurists of the late 16th century about the legitimacy of the state power in Russia -"illegitimate tyranny" by Herberstein and Fletcher and "legitimate despotism" by Boden. These debates in Renaissance
   Europe informed and shaped the concept of the patrimonial monarchy (patrimonial system) in Russia, which was subsequently developed by Russian influential historians (V.O. Klyuchevsky, P.N. Milyukov and others) and foreign experts (R. Pipes, E. Carrer d'Ancausse and others).
   The second half of the article analyzes the concept of "Europeanization" ("Westernization") of Russia and offers a periodization of this phenomenon. The start of early Europeanization, when Russia began borrowing military, technical, cultural, and other innovations from Western Europe can be dated from the birth of a unified Moscow state. Peter's Westernization was indeed a new stage in adopting European experience because he removed the state and church barriers in the communication of Russian people with Western Europeans and encouraged not only going to the West for education and science, but also opened the way to the creation of secular education and science in Russia. These were prerequisites for the beginning of the modernization of Russia.
   In other matters, Peter's westernization differed from the previous periods only in the number of cultural and institutional adoptions. Peter's political system was the apogee of the patrimonial culture in Russia.

DT Article
DE cross-border cooperation; the Kuril Islands; Russian market reforms;
   Japan policy on the "Northern territories"
AB The article shows the specifics of interaction between the Kuril districts of the Sakhalin Oblast and foreign business at the initial stage of Russian market reforms. In the analysis, the author relies on the characterization of the behavior lines of the participants and the event series from the point of view of historical regionalism. It is concluded that the development of cross-border cooperation in the Kuril sub-region was strongly negatively affected by the counteraction policy of the Japanese authorities, who considered the returning the southern Kuril Islands under their jurisdiction a matter of the nearest future. The reaction of the Russian leadership to this challenge was uncertain and contradictory. All this has put the southern Kuril Islands in a situation of uncertainty about their future political fate. As a result, a model of foreign economic relations was formed here, which was almost completely reduced to the legal and illegal export of marine bioresources and only point interactions in the onshore economy, being a brake on the development of island territories and not contributing to their recovery from the permanent crisis of the 1990s.

To do so, the monographic, economic-statistical, and abstract-logical methods are utilized. Digital technologies transform the economic space, completely changing the connections in global value chains, increasing the existing imbalances in the global economy (due to the gap in the digitalization degree of national economies).Thus, the development of digital technologies is full of contradictions: on the one hand, the polarity of political systems, on the other, the uneven, but continuous integration of the digital economic space.

DT Article
DE theory of knowledge; scientific method; sensualism; rationalism;
   activity; philosophical anthropology
AB The article attempts to see the methodology of empirical science proposed by Francis Bacon from an epistemological point of view. It considers the concept of the subject of cognition and its interaction with the cognizable object. The term "active subject of cognition" could not be used by an English philosopher, since this term reflects one of the later approaches to understanding the process of cognition. The article shows that Bacon points to the activity-based nature of the scientific experiment. This approach allows us to give a solution to the problem of the role of sensory data in cognition, which allows us to avoid the acathalepsy of ancient skepticism. The article shows that Bacon's understanding of the experiment can be considered as the first approach to the representation of the givenness of the object of cognition in the forms of practice. At the same time, the reason why this attitude was not developed in the theory of cognition of the 17th and 18th centuries is analyzed. The author of the article sees the explanation of this fact in the exceptional role of anthropological concepts adopted in the philosophy of the European Enlightenment. The self-sufficiency of the epistemological subject, its cognitive autonomy, is the anthropological basis of the theory of cognition of the past. It is manifested in the classical concepts of sensualism, rationalism and Kantian transcendentalism, which fully realized the idea of a self-sufficient epistemological subject. Epistemological search cannot ignore this circumstance. The modern solution to the problem of cognition requires a new anthropology based on the study of the cultural and active evolution of human communities, and an explanation for the formation of a cognitive attitude to the world and human cognitive abilities. The author shows that Bacon was one of the initiators of an active version of the theory of knowledge. The justification of the validity of this judgment is the subject of this article.

DT Article
DE Great Patriotic War of 1941-45; Leningrad; blockade; historical source;
   archive; transcript
AB The article is devoted to the history of creation and characterization of transcripts of narratives of the Leningrad citizens who lived in the besieged city during the war. The article is to determine the significance of this historical source for the study of the siege of Leningrad. The idea to collect materials on the wartime city emerged in autumn 1941 and was implemented by the staff of the Leningrad Institute for the History of the CPSU, who began to prepare chronicles of Leningrad and its region during the Great Patriotic War. A notable part of this work was stenography of stories of the soldiers and partisans who fought in the Leningrad region and of the residents of the besieged city. The work of the Leningrad historians began in spring 1942, intensified in April 1943, and was completed in early 1948. The prepared shorthand notes were preserved in series 10 of the fond R-4000 of the Central State Archive of Political and Historical Documents of St. Petersburg. Over 350 of the 650 archival documents are records of conversations with the Leningrad residents. In the 1960s, 130 items (duplicates) were transferred to the St. Petersburg Institute of History of the Russian Academy of Sciences, forming the body of fond 332 of the Scientific-Historical Archive of the St. Petersburg Institute of History of the Russian Academy of Sciences. As a rule, the respondents were middle-ranking executives: directors and chiefs, chairmen and secretaries of district executive committees (raikoms); but there also were ordinary workers and engineers, teachers and policemen, scientists and artists. Questionnaires were prepared for representatives of some professions and positions in 1944-45, which permitted to identify common features in the life of citizens and specifics of the respondents' activities. Varied scope of the interviewees and wide range of questions were supplemented by the possibility for the narrator to use various documents in their answers. The "freshness of memories" and narration to a Leningrad resident, who had undergone the same ordeal, contributed to creation of voluminous and relatively objective picture of life and activities of citizens in besieged Leningrad. Nevertheless, self-censorship was apparent, and while few made direct distortions, exclusion of some "inconvenient" (in narrator's opinion) details from the final text was quite common. The study of transcripts permits to reveal new facts about the history of wartime Leningrad, to broaden our understanding of the blockade everyday life, and to give impetus to the analysis of the era in terms of history of emotions and micro-history. Most valuable and interesting transcripts can be published in anthologies.

DT Article
DE Asymmetric warfare; hybrid peace; ethnography of violence; Walter
   Benjamin; Karl Schmitt; guerilla; suicide pilot; drone ethics
AB The article challenges traditional notions of war and war ethics from the standpoints of a terrorist attack victim and of a drone strike victim, of the decentralized opposition of "old" and "new" wars, "major" wars and "small" ones, combatants vs. non-combatants, soldiers vs guerilla fighters, friends vs enemies, victors vs defeated. Accordingly, the authors consider the political status and social role of ethnographic, anthropological and ethical research within the context of "new wars," which include guerilla warfare and resort to terrorist tactics. Building on current research in sociology, anthropology, ethics and political studies (Hugh Gusterson, Mary Kaldor, Jeff McMahan, Lucy Sachman, Emran Feroz, Gregoire Chamayou, Kirill Martynov, Victor Vakhshtayn et al.), the authors regard whether drone technologies and other automated weapons conform to the Russia's military ethics. They also speculate upon prospects of some technologies being socially adapted in different world cultures.
   The article brings up to date critique of violence by Walter Benjamin and problematizes the concept of the political by Carl Schmitt through the lens of the presentday military ethnography (see Nikolai Ssorin-Chaikov's Hybrid Peace: Ethnographies of War in this issue of Logos). Analyzing historical transformations and inversions of guerillas, suicide pilots, UAV operators and suicide bombers deconstructs the notion of "hybrid war" as well as "hybrid peace." Finally, the authors introduce a project of a less rigoristic and not purely prohibitive ethical program ("drone ethics") which might serve as a basis for automated systems' algorithms to make decisions during military crises and states of emergency. The article continues to address the range of problems brought up in the Logos issue on war (Vol. 29 #3 2019).

American monopolies have strengthened their economic positions, seized a number of markets. The expansion of American imperialism has led to an aggravation of contradictions between the United States and the rest of the capitalist countries, to an even greater instability of the world system of capitalist economy.

TI EUROPEAN UNION - CHINA IN THE CHANGING WORLD COMPOSITION

DE China; EU; G7; U.S.A.; technologies; investments; competition; world
   order
AB By 2021, the nature of the key factors that will determine the dynamics of the EU-China relations in the medium term has become clearer. The pandemic accelerated many ongoing processes in the world, revealed "weak points" in national and regional economies and security, and exposed the true intentions of international actors. The authors proceed from the working hypothesis that an ideologized rigid approach with elements of pragmatism will dominate in the EU-China relations in the post-crisis period. The balance in the formula of these relations "partner, competitor, rival" will significantly depend on the position of the United States, as well as the European Union's compliance with the "bloc discipline". Competition in the field of technology will be of key importance, but the struggle for political and ideological leadership in the changing world order will also become more acute. The political response of the EU and China to technological challenges will represent a mix of protectionism and neo-techno-nationalism. Politicians in the European Union feel that toughness toward Beijing is well received by the voters. At the same time, the EU member states diverge in their approaches to China, although the efforts are made to harmonise policies both in the European Union and in the transatlantic community. In its turn, the PRC feels more confident in the technological and political competition. The pace of China catching up with the technological abilities of the EU is impressive, though significant gaps remain. Beijing does not have intentions of de-coupling from the West and keeps a strong interest in being present in the EU markets, but it becomes more selective with regard to foreign investments at home. Meanwhile, the global shift of world politics to Asia will require adjustment on the part of the European Union. A possible approach already tested in expert discussions is further engagement with trading partners and blocs in the region, especially the newly established Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. The EU-China relations and their influence, in particular, on Russia were the subject of case study organized by the Center for Situational Analysis of IMEMO RAN. For details see: Analysis and Forecasting. IMEMO Journal, 2021, no. 2. (Available at: https://www.afjournal.ru/index.php?page_id=464#).

   geocultural images; topoi; spatial categories
AB The author of the article refers to the comprehension of a personal biographical narrative, which reflects a person's ideas about the geographical environment, that is, the phenomenon of "imagination of space". The relevance of the study is explained by the fact that modern humanities develop and apply new methodological principles and approaches to identify mechanisms for adapting a person in fundamentally different, "foreign" conditions. The material of the study was the egodocuments, memoirs and fiction of V. L. Seroshevsky, a Polish political exile who spent 12 long years in Yakutia. The aim of the study is to identify the content basis of Vaclav Seroshevsky's geopoetics, which consists in modeling and transforming the image of the North through the prism of "living and experiencing" space. The methodological principles of modern cross-cultural research, where human life is a narrative structure are applied in the article. As a result of historical-cognitive and linguo-culturological analysis, Seroshevsky's autobiographical chronotope, consisting of three periods, broadcasting the formation, development and transformation of the geocultural image of the North, was analyzed for the first time. Three actual images-topoi (sea, forest, steppe valley) associated with the emotive-sensual factor that influenced the author's landscape of Vaclav Seroshevsky were identified.

LA Russian
DT Book Review
DE communism; socialism; Marxism; post-capitalism; virtue ethics; ethics of
   principles
AB The article is dedicated to comprehending the ideas set forth in the monograph by Leonid Fishman The Age of Virtues: After Soviet Morality, which raises the question of the reasons for the rapid destruction of "high" communist morality in the USSR, as well as the sliding of the Russian society in the 1990s into a state of "war of all against all". Setting himself the task of tracing how "evil" is born from "good", Fishman draws attention to the fact that the communist morality of the Soviet Union contained an internal contradiction due to the combination of what can be called virtue ethics and the ethics of principles. Virtues consist of values that are relevant to certain communities. At the same time, virtue ethics has a dual nature. Under certain social circumstances, it contributes to nurturing a harmonious individual who strives for high social goals. This happens if the ethics of principles rises above it, setting higher goals and general ideas about how to treat other members of society. But if the ethics of principles ceases to function, nothing prevents the virtues from serving pure evil, for even members of mafia clans are not strangers to heroism, devotion, and honor. Fishman demonstrates how the virtue ethics gradually replaced the ethics of principles, bringing closer the collapse of the great communist project.
   According to Dmitry Davydov's conclusion, the value of Fishman's research is greater than just historical. No communist project can exclude either its humanistic core, with the focus on the liberation of the individual, or its emphasis on the socialization of the individual in these or other communities. But any "harmonious" personality and any community that serves "the good" risk transforming into their opposites: into a selfish individual and an association of "friends", for whom everyone "who is not with us" is an enemy.

The study introduces and substantiates the concept of "spatial conversion" as a cyclical process of considering and incorporating individual and group interests of individual top managers and business organizations as political stakeholders in the framework of their activities for the generation of political rent and maximizing economic profit. The first part of the paper analyzes the impact of the international context, its conditions and factors on the implementation of construction policy and lobbying of large developers. The article distinguishes between the terms ''lobbying'' as a micro-political activity carried out by non-government stakeholders and ''lobbyism'' as a system of functional interest representation in a specific area.

One of the mechanisms is the construction of ethno-political myths, which can have both constructive and destructive social effects. The process of constructing destructive ethno-political myths in relation to the Crimean Peninsula is particularly revealing in this context. As Crimea, because of significance its military-strategic position, serve as a platform for testing various forms of social destabilization, by the USA, Turkey and European countries, including through the actualization of Crimean Tatar issues. American technologies for constructing the "eternal" foe image in the mythonarrative of the Crimean Tatars based on materials of the US State Department, nonprofit organizations, analytical centers, publications of the American scientific and expert community, mass media, data of Crimean Tatar organizations is considered by the authors in this article.

Zinoviev, with whom the author got acquainted as early as in 1950-s, being a student of the faculty of philosophy at Moscow State University when A.A. Zinoviev, E.V. Ilyenkov and other post-graduate students and professors were some sort of masterminds, thought leaders. The author chanced to study and work with these talented scientists at the department of dialectical materialism in the Institute of philosophy, USSR Academy of Sciences, and since then they were his closest friends and teachers until their death. The author reveals the depth and universality of A.A. Zinoviev's philosophical views, political and cultural ideas, his uncompromising attitude to erroneous ideas and trends of political and ideological leaders of that time, as well as pro-Western writers and artists. Unlike the latter case A.A. Zinovev, while criticizing significant theoretical and practical shortcomings of the Soviet regime, remained the true patriot of his country and its people in all the periods of his life: before his exile, during the exile and after coming back come. The author reveals A.A. Zinoviev's many-sided, prophetical talent of a philosopher, logician, writer, essayist, critic, his fearlessness and courage in his striving and fighting for truth, freedom, justice and genuine democracy.

AB The publication characterizes autobiographies of the historian, ethnographer, linguist, "father" of the Russian school of Mayanism Yuri Valentinovich Knorozov (1922-99), that have been identified in the fonds of various institutions and departments: (State Archive of the Russian Federation (GARF), Scientific Archive of the Russian Ethnographic Museum (REM), Scientific Archive of the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography of the Russian Academy of Sciences (MAE RAN). Autobiography is a "free" author's presentation (with fixed semantic accents, sometimes duplicating the data of personnel sheet) and a mandatory formal element of Soviet personnel management. The text of the autobiography was influenced by the document's purpose: individual facts unfit for socially and ideologically correct biography were "hushed up" or otherwise carefully explained by the author. Drawing on Yu. V. Knorozov's autobiographies written in different years and for different reasons (admission to graduate school, employment, dissertation defense, promotion to honorary titles), the article assesses how explanatory statements were changing textually. "Corrections" are considered using the example of specific facts: during the Great Patriotic War (from 1941 to February 1943), Yuri Knorozov, a student of the Kharkiv Pedagogical University, unfit for military service for health reasons, was in the territory occupied by the enemy. The article is accompanied by the publication of a detailed autobiography of Yuri Knorozov (1981) compiled on the occasion of his nomination as corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in "General history" (ethnography). The autobiography text contains information on most important facts of Yuri Knorozov's scientific biography, including his expeditions (field research), reports at foreign scientific events and participation in international scientific associations. The author concludes that it is more important to analyze not the content of the autobiography, but the socio-political circumstances and practices that determined its semantic framework.

AB These article and publication of archival documents are dedicated to the place and significance of political economy in Nikolay I. Kareev's scientific heritage (1850-1931). Kareev's appeal to political economy was due to both his historical research and the need to justify the methodological status of sociology which synthesizes the achievements of other social disciplines. The positions of political economy are characterized by Kareev with phenomenological and nomological methodological approaches applied to the social Sciences. It is concluded that Kareev's approach is contradictory and inconsistent. On the one hand, he is sympathetic to the liberal attitudes of English political economy, and on the other hand, as a historian, he understands the value of "historicism" (the tradition of Russian conservative liberalism). Kareev is aware of the danger of reductionism represented in economic materialism. According to the scientist, the pluralistic method of the sociology considering the development of society as a derivative of many factors has the potential for overcoming it. The article is accompanied by the publication of a fragment of the sixth Chapter of the unpublished work by N.I. Kareev "General methodology of the Humanities". The text is published from Kareev's manuscript found in the research Department of manuscripts of the Russian state library.

DE anthropocentrism; technocentrism; post-modernity; Homo oeconomicus; Homo
   faber
AB The article considers two fundamental civilizational transitions that have defined the modern development of mankind: the transition from theocentrism to anthropocentrism and the transition from the latter to technocentrism. Namely, technocentrism determines, in the author's opinion, the key trajectory of this movement. The article shows that, since the Renaissance, the development of capitalism has proceeded in parallel with the tendency to individualization, which both Protestantism and socialism in different variants tried to resist. At the same time, the rationalist approach to man, on the one hand, forms the consciousness of Homo faber, the creative man who, with the help of technology, recreates nature and himself, and, on the other hand, adopts a utilitarian ethic that simplifies human relations to the most primitive senses. At the same time, socio-economic sciences emerge guided by the models of physics, assuming that man can be represented objectively as an external nature, i.e., reducing him only to a material base. Progress, which in Condorcet's and Saint- Simon's understanding is moral perfection, is then reduced to the external transformation of man on the basis of science. The reduction of man to a set of simple feelings and needs, regulated rationally, forms the core image of Adam Smith's political economy. This prepares the spiritual foundation for a new stage of civilizational development, when it is not man who is the measure of all things, but technology. Moral relations are replaced by legal relations, and authentic existence is swapped for non-authentic existence. The state acts as the key agent of all social transformations, regulating human behavior by means of punishments and rewards. Accordingly, a system of "surplus power" emerges, justified by the struggle against subjectivism and the transition to objectivism symbolized by digitalization. Management becomes a science, with management separated from the governed. In the education system, the ideal of creating a harmonious personality is replaced by the ideal of a professional who sells well on the labor market. Relationships in a society built on these principles are becoming increasingly cold, and the individual is becoming less and less of a personality.

DE metaphysics; subjectum-basis; subject-synthesis
AB The question of the crisis of metaphysics continues to excite philosophical thought, responding to Heidegger's message of the first half of the 20th century which was supported by Habermas at the end of the 20th century. The origins of metaphysics go back to the theme of foundation, declared by Greco-Roman, Christian culture, where thought and being merge. Crisis is associated with the transition to modernism, which discovered the principle of alienation and positivist intentions. Positivism introduced the subject-synthesis - a kind of a concept that is built not through foundation, but through gathering, accumulating experience of different connections. Communication ties, gradually displacing all the others, began to determine a new order of understanding the world order, shifting the emphasis from semantic, epistemological foundations, to the horizon of sign-symbolic relations. The event of deconstruction, not as a method or a new paradigm, but as a special metaphysics, became a new starting point for the subject, unlocking the possibility of presence of experience within its boundaries that escapes the thought, hidden in linguistic substitutions, metonymy. This is how the zone of the Other was designated; it allowed the unclear, the unconscious, the previously ignored and repressed by meaning and breaking through the language to penetrate into the thought. The subject-synthesis in the situation of the 20th century also revealed itself in an effort to regain its physical, "alienated" side. These aspirations became associated with positivist claims to raise physical science to the level of "all sciences", to overthrow metaphysics, on the one hand and with immersion in the event of "work" as a way of establishing in being, associated with the mobilization means of technology, design, production, typification, digitalization (Ernst Junger), on the other. The meaningful message of metaphysics is consistent as long as there are "meeting places" in the culture, where there will be no synthetic effort to impose semantic landmarks, but the need for their acquisition. This is what various projects of modern philosophy demonstrate. It remains only to understand that it becomes possible to break through to them by following only new paths. Some of them are: deconstruction, "work", "production of meanings", technology, etc.

AB Research objectives: This work is aimed at identifying in the works of pre-revolutionary Russian historians issues related to various aspects of the existence of the Mongol Empire from its prehistory to the collapse, with special attention to the presentation of the ideology of its leaders. Research materials: The main sources are the major works of fifteen famous Russian historians of the XIX - early XX centuries: N.A. Polevoy, M.P. Pogodin, N.G. Ustryalov, N.I. Kostomarov, S.M. Solovyov, K.N. Bestuzhev-Ryumin, D.I. Ilovaisky, E.E. Go-lubinsky, V.O. Klyuchevsky, A.V. Ekzemplyarsky, S.F. Platonov, M.K. Lyubavsky, M.S. Grushevsky, M.N. Pokrovsky, and A.E. Presnyakov. Additional information was drawn from historiographical and Oriental literature. Results and novelty of the research: An analytical review of the pre-revolutionary Russian historiography showed a very different depth of penetration of historians into is-sues related to the Mongol Empire. For a number of specialists, the empire did not seem to exist, and all historical Mongol-Russian conflicts were confined to the Jochid Ulus. Others, taking a contrary approach, demonstrate a good understanding of the internal structure of this colossal political organism and the processes that took place inside it. The amount of information about the Mongols and Mongol Empire in the works of Russian historians were not dependent on the number of available medieval eastern sources at one time or another, being determined rather naturally by the author's position. Along with erroneous opinions, the Old Russian historiography gave rise to many insights and hypotheses that were ahead of their time.

AB The paper presents an attempt to fill in some research gaps in the relationships between the Government and Catholics of the People's Republic of China with the Vatican and with the Catholic Church as a whole. It is a common knowledge, that there are no official ties between Chinese Catholics and the Holy See, which is caused not only by general historical reasons, but also by specific circumstances, which include the tragedy associated with the execution of the Italian pilot of the First World War, Antonio Riva, who lived in Beijing and was executed for trumped up accusations. The publication shows how the relationship between the Chinese authorities and the Papal Throne, already complicated by centuries of misunderstanding, was further undermined due to an insoluble tangle of problems, associated with the non- recognition of Taiwan. Considerable attention is paid to the personality and statements of the Bishop of Beijing Fu Tieshan (19302007), being a kind of mouthpiece of the Chinese government in matters of the the authorities' attitude to both their Catholic citizens and to the Papal Curia. On the example of Fu Tieshan's rhetoric of the early 80s, who concurrently headed the Chinese Patriotic Association, the author demonstrates the complexity of the Chinese Catholics' situation, positioned between the "rock" of the CPC and the "hard place" of the Vatican, which holds a rather flexible position on the issue of diplomatic relations with Taiwan, being a necessary condition for building bridges between the Chinese believers and Rome. The paper also pays attention to another hitherto unresolved issue, i.e., the issue of the appointment of Catholic bishops in the PRC: The Vatican is fighting for its right to approve bishops appointed by the Chinese government. The author expresses cautious optimism regarding the possible resolution of the considered problems, with inevitable skepticism singling out the intractable "Taiwan question" in these positive expectations.

AB Introduction. In the spring and summer of 1917 changes in the former autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland determined the history of relations between Russia and Finland for decades to come. The purpose of the article is to show changes in the political views and positions of the Baltic sailors and the army servicemen, who were elected to democratic organizations of the Russian military at the final stage of the First World War. Methods and materials. The article is based on the results of long standing study of issues, dealing with the stay of the Russian armed forces in the Grand Duchy of Finland, and follows the theoretical developments of V.D. Zimina, B.I. Kolonitsky, E. Mawdsley, A. Wildman on the problems of the Russian revolution of 1917. It uses a historical and anthropological approach to the research of the role of the military factor in the history of Russia and Finland in the 20th Century. Analysis. Reviewed archival documents and published sources indicate that immediately after the February Revolution active party organizations in the units were either a rare exception or experienced a stage of formation, which affected the actions of the primary personnel of the Soviets, as well as soldier's and sailor's committees. During the spring months voters' political sympathies were closely associated with the Socialist Revolutionaries as the most popular party in Russia. However, by the summer of 1917 the readiness of the socialist leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and the Mensheviks to continue the war increasingly contradicted the interests of ordinary servicemen. The question of how the activities of the Soviets and committees of this period fit into the rope of events that became the "prologue" of the Civil War in Russia has been investigated. It is pointed out, that such measures include the abolition of the old apparatus of power, the refusal to comply with the orders of the military authorities, not agreed with soldier and sailor organizations, assistance in the deployment and strengthening of the political union of the Bolsheviks and left-wing groups of socialist parties, support provided to the radical wing of the Finnish social-democracy. Results. The study of socio-political transformations that took place in the Russian military community during the period under review and predetermined changes in the views and positions of the Russian servicemen in Finland allows us to conclude the following. In the spring and summer of 1917 leaders of the Soviets and committees still managed to accumulate a certain experience of "inter-party" interaction. It was first noted that that in the course of the revolution development representative organizations of sailors and the army men just during these months were prepared for an independent line of behavior and sometimes outpaced the protest actions of military personnel in the Russian capital.

DT Article
DE S. S. Kondurushkin; A. M. Gorky; biography; correspondence; dialogue;
   intellectual history; literary and social life of the turn of the XIX-XX
   centuries
AB Introduction: the article is devoted to the analysis of the correspondence between S. S. Kondurushkin and A. M. Gorky in 1908-1913. Despite the fact that most of Gorky's Mordovian correspondent writers are well known to modern science, there are still gaps in the study of this period of Russian culture. The article reconstructs the pages of the biography of the writer and journalist Kondurushkin, whose work is an integral part of the most complex period of formation of the Mordovian literature.
   Kondurushkin's popularity among the readers of the newspapers "Rcch" ("The Speech") and "Zemlya" ("The Earth"), journals "Russkoe Bogatstvo" ("The Russian Wealth"), "Istoricheskiy Vestnik" ("The Historical Bulletin") and "Niva", his work in a wide genre range (from a short story and novella to a travel essay and feuilleton, journalistic article and political note) had a great influence on Mordovian writers entering the literary and journalistic path. A special page is his personal and creative contacts with S. V. Anikin, one of the founders of Erzya literature, who became the author of the newspaper "Rcch" with Kondurushkin's participation.
   Objective: to analyze episodes of personal and creative relations between Stepan Kondurushkin and Maxim Gorky on a broad historical and literary background.
   Research materials: materials of the diary and personal archive of the writer S. S. Kondurushkin, reviews and responses to collections of his stories.
   Results and novelty of the research: based on the analysis of the correspondence between Kondurushkin and Gorky and materials reflecting the intellectual history and cultural life of the turn of the XIX-XX centuries, episodes and contexts of personal and professional relationships of writers are reconstructed and analyzed. The preserved letters and the biography of Kondurushkin published for the first time allow us to assess the personality of correspondent Gorky in a new way, correlate his works with the creative ideas of the young writer, and clarify his artistic and aesthetic views and positions.
   In his dialogue with Gorky, Kondurushkin, recognizing the authority of the great writer and following his advice, demonstrates creative independence and independence in literary and critical evaluations and preferences. As evidenced by Kondurushkin's letters and diary entries, the writer's communication with Gorky became an important part of his professional development and, to a certain extent, contributed to his acquisition of literary skill and creative maturity.

Analyzing the works of Russian and German historians, the author comes to the conclusion that in German historiography, as well as in Russian historical science, there is still no special comprehensive study of the Russian direction of Bismarck's foreign policy in the long period of 1851-1871, on the eve and during the years of German unification.

AB This article is devoted to the scholarly work of the prominent Russian historian, Doctor of Sciences (History), Professor of St Petersburg State University Mikhail Pavlovich Iroshnikov. A student of two well-known St Petersburg-Leningrad scholars, Alexander Ignatievich Andreev and Sigismund Natanovich Valk, M. P. Iroshnikov became one of the leading specialists in the field of the political history of Russia of the 20th century, the history of state and law, the history of state institutions, archives, source studies, historiography and archeography. The successor to the traditions of the St Petersburg historical school - the school of S. F. Platonov, A. S. Lappo-Danilevsky, A. E. Presnyakov - M. P. Iroshnikov not only became a recognized Russian archaeographer, an expert in archival documents, but also a thoughtful, attentive researcher. The most important academic achievements of M. P. Iroshnikov was the study of the creation, activities and personnel of the Soviet government in 1917-1922, and the discovery and introduction of the census of Soviet employees in 1918 into the scholarship. The article analyzes the work of M. P. Iroshnikov in organizing and implementing many of the largest domestic archeographic projects: the publication of the works of V. N. Tatishchev, decrees of the Soviet government, the Radziwil Chronicle. The article also examines the pedagogical activity of M. P. Iroshnikov in St Petersburg State University, where he continued the traditions of his teachers in educating historians, archeographers and source specialists.

DT Article
DE Michel Foucault; historicism; Pierre Hadot; care of self; subject;

AB Michel Foucault was well known as an epistemologist, historicist, and historian of thought. His analyses of ancient culture are a crucial moment for his doctrine of the becoming of the subject. The Foucaultian version of the ancient legacy in modern and contemporary Western culture shows clearly its aspects in the opposition of Pierre Hadot's doctrine. If Hadot accents the mystic mode of subjectivation, Foucault tends to the modes of dandyism and the esthetics of existence. At the same time, both of them belong to the same tradition in the history of the Western intellectual culture that traces the meaning of the human being in the perfectibility and concern of self. This article detects the roots of Foucaultian historicist position and origins of his conceptualization of the care of the self. The Foucaultian conceptualization mixes platonic concerns of the government of self, Nietzschean critics of Kantianism, and the Heideggerian approach to the philosophy of history, the sum of which in this case is radical historicism. As a result, Foucault proposes a contemporary version of the ancient practice of self and asserts the understanding of philosophy of the self. The author's theses is that the focus of Foucauldian philosophy is the care of self as the basic mode of subjectivation in the political and ethical realms of the Western culture.

AB The article is devoted to the socio-cultural factors of justification and implementation of political authority in Ancient India. The political aspects of Brahmanism are considered: the idea of the political dominance of Brahmins over Kshatriyas, the idea of the divine nature of royal authority, the idea of the violent nature of authority. The innovative nature of these ideas for the period of their origin and development is noted. Special attention is paid to the issue of the correlation of dharma (following duty) and artha (following practical benefits) in a harmonious society. The solution of this problem is considered by the political thought of Ancient India, including in the political treatise "Arthashastra". In addition, the article reveals the monarchical and republican traditions of Ancient Indian statehood. It is noted that it is not correct to reduce the tradition of early Indian statehood exclusively to one of the modifications of Eastern despotism.

ID RULE
AB The Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021- 2027 was adopted during the severe crisis caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. In the face of a rapidly deteriorating economic situation, EU countries took unprecedented steps radically changing the principles of resource allocation in the Union. These included the recovery plan for Europe, making the EU budget conditional on respect for the rule of law and the new EU resources system. This article seeks to identify the essential characteristics of the decisions made within the Multiannual Financial Framework and define their significance for advancing integration. The study attempts to answer two questions: do these decisions mark the transition to a new stage of integration and to what extent do they comply with the law of the Union. Several EU initiatives related to debt redistribution are analysed, along with the impact of these initiatives on Eastern European countries, particularly those of the Baltic Sea region. The research explores the decisions from the standpoint of legal and political science. In particular, it is stressed that, when reaching a compromise on making the budget conditional on respect for the rule of law, the EU and its member states had to use a mechanism for postponing the execution of an act of the Union, which contradicts the basic principles of EU law. From a political point of view, the adoption of a package of legislative acts within the Multiannual Financial Framework means growing dependence of the member states and an increase in solidarity and loyalty within the Union.

DT Article
DE Revolutionary Wars; Napoleonic Wars; global history; intellectual

AB The article is a review of Jeremy Black's book "Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars: Strategies for World War". The central issue of the monograph is the problem of strategy development in European armed conflicts at the turn of the 18-19 centuries in a global context. The author of the book points out that the development of strategic plans is influenced not only by military concepts and traditions, but by the social, political and cultural contexts of the age. Since the scale of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars went beyond Western Europe, land and sea operations should be considered in a global dimension, considering other clashes in Asia, North and South America. The vast geography of hostilities forced the warring countries to adjust their policies. J. Black points out that despite the revolutionary innovations, much in the French armed forces remained the same. Napoleon, having abandoned part of the legacy of the 1790s, was unable to develop a successful strategy that was effective at the global level. France lost the struggle for dominance in sea lanes and lost its influence in India and the Caribbean. It also failed to establish successful interaction with its allies. The result of a series of wars of the late 18 - early 19 centuries was not only the rise of the British and Russian empires, but also significant changes in the strategic planning of the European powers.

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to the reconstruction of the events that took place in the city of Mariinsk on May 25, 1918. On this day, the Czechoslovak Corps, which was located at the railway station, rebelled. In historiography it is believed that the uprising of the Czechs and Slovaks provoked a large-scale civil war in Russia. Methods and materials. The main sources for the study were the materials of the periodical press of that time. The newspapers "Siberian Life" and "Voice of the People" published articles by correspondents who directly observed the events taking place in the city or received information from direct participants in the uprising. In addition, archival materials were used, in particular, a telegram from a member of the executive committee of the Mariinsky Soviet of Deputies, Kolesnikov. Analysis. It was established that at the end of May 1918, there were three military and political forces in the city of Mariinsk: a local Red Guard detachment; a Red Guard outsider (the so-called partisans) that arrived from the cities of Western Siberia; and a Czechoslovak Corps. During the conflict that occurred between the two Red Guard units the local Red Guards were disarmed. After that the partisans began to rob local residents and apartments of railway workers. To calm them down, the troops of the Czechoslovak Corps intervened. They quickly disarmed the partisans and took control of the city. Analysis of the telegram of Kolesnikov, a member of the executive committee of the Mariinsky Council of Deputies, showed that it is a copy of the original and contains several significant errors. In particular, the uprising of the Czechoslovak Corps took place on the evening of May 25, and not in the morning, as indicated in the telegram. The Mariinsky events became known in Moscow on the same day. The Chairman of the Supreme Military Council, L. D. Trotsky, took advantage of this to issue a brutal order for the disarmament of the Czechoslovak Corps and the physical destruction of those Czechs who would not surrender to Soviet power. Results. To some extent, the uprising of the Czechoslovak Corps was forced. It was a response to the unrest that arose in the city after the conflict between two Red Guard detachments. The central Soviet authorities in Moscow took advantage of this and ordered the actual extermination of the Czechs. This was the impetus for the emergence of large-scale military operations and Civil War in Russia. Authors' contribution. A. N. Ermolaev identified historical sources, deciphered the text of the telegram, designed the text of the article. I. Yu. Uskov participated in the deciphering of the text of the telegram and the preparation of the text of the article.

AB The article proves the hypothesis that F. M. Dostoevsky's novel The Raw Youth expresses the conception of history directed against the model proposed by L N. Tolstoy in his War and Peace. Tolstoy maintains that the course of history is determined by the spontaneous interactions of elementary biological powers acting within individuals and within nations; he firmly rejects the idea that individuals can influence history by means of their rational will. In his novel The Raw Youth, Dostoevsky defends totally contrary position: only few "higher personalities" can immediately influence history by means of their great ideas, among which the religious ones play especially important role. The article shows that Dostoevsky's critique had probably an impact on Tolstoy; as a result, in his late religious teaching, he adopted the position which he had previously rejected. Now he thinks that only few "best people" living in the strong compliance with the Jesus Christ's doctrine direct society towards the way of spiritual perfectness and thus they determine the course of history. This general model of historical development of society can be named as "spiritual Empire" which is contrary to the accepted western liberal tradition generated by the philosophy of the Enlightenment. Within the model of "spiritual Empire", the aim of the development is represented with the more and more spiritual unity of people and with the fact that everybody serve to the highest values (the creation of culture); such society should be ruled by the "highest personalities" who achieved the highest spiritual development and influence the society rather with the help of their spiritual authority than by means of the material power.

AB The main models of rationalization formed in the classical period of the Arab-Muslim culture (VIII-XV centuries) have had a notable impact on Modern political discourse in Iran. The paper presents an analysis of the political concept of the ideologist of the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 Ayatollah Khomeini (1902-1989). Applying the categorical model "explicit - hidden" (.ahir - ba.in) to the analysis of Khomeini's argumentation makes it possible to identify the most important references to the major philosophemes of mature Sufism in his main work "Governance of the Jurist: Islamic Government" (Vilayat-i faqih: hukumat-i islami). The paper explores Khomeini's views on the phenomenon of Islamic rule, personal qualities and duties of the ruler-jurist (faqih). The result shows how the concept of the "Perfect Human Being" (insan kamil), of the greatest Sufi thinker Ibn 'Arabi (1165-1240) is realized and fundamentally reconsidered in Khomeini's political manifesto. In Ibn `Arabi's philosopheme the unity of God-and-world is manifested by the "Perfect Human Being". The governance of Khomeini's "Righteous Jurist" helps maintain God-and-people "connection" at state level. A comparison of Ibn `Arabi's philosopheme and the political concept the "Governance of the Jurist" sheds light on the ways the "Perfect Human Being" concept increasingly associated with the figure of "Righteous Jurist" in socio-political reality of pre-revolutionary Iran.

AB The article examines the correspondence of the Hanoverian resident in Russia Friedrich Christian Weber over the period from January 1718 to the spring of 1720. The set of letters includes over two hundred reports written by the diplomate in French and currently deposited in the French Manuscripts collection of the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford. The goal of this article is to present this source to the scholarly audience and to offer its preliminary analysis. Although Weber was formally a Hanoverian resident, he represented the interests of England, because the Elector of Hanover, since 1714, was also the monarch of Great Britain. The addressee of Weber's letters was John Robethon, George l's diplomatic secretary. The article examines various aspects of Weber's diplomatic activities, including the methods he used to collect information in Russia and send it to England, such as bribing Russian officials, resorting to secret agents, ciphers, sending dispatches "under the cover, and others. The letters also reflect the tasks set before him by his government, first of all, investigating the nature of relations between the Russian court and the Jacobites and monitoring the progress of the Congress of Aland, including the views of the Russian and Swedish courts regarding the prospects of a separate peace treaty between them. The article also considers Weber's approach to the analysis of the international situation and the political situation in Russia. He concluded that a separate treaty between Russia and Sweden was highly unlikely and sought to convey this to his addressee. In spite of this the British government continued to view the ongoing negotiations at Aland as a threat. Beginning in May 1718, the Court of St. James repeatedly instructed Weber to find ways to disrupt Congress. The set of letters shed light on the history of Russian foreign policy at the final stage of the Great Northern War on the eve of the conclusion of the Peace of Nystad.

   Struggle Against the Soviet Union. Between Politics and Propaganda
SO NOVEISHAYA ISTORIYA ROSSII-MODERN HISTORY OF RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE World War II; Turkey; Germany; nazism; Caucasus; propaganda; pan-Turkism
AB The article examines the evolution of Nazi Germany's approaches towards Turkey and pan-Turkism in the German struggle against the Soviet Union. Particular attention is paid to political and diplomatic considerations, as well as propaganda guidelines adopted in Germany after the invasion of the Soviet Union. Geographically, a special emphasis is laid on the North Caucasus. Turkey was linked with the Caucasus in general and with the North Caucasus in particular through centuries-old cultural and religious ties that flowed naturally from geographical proximity, often supplemented by ethnic and religious affinities between Turkey and the Caucuses, including the North Caucasian peoples. Turkish influence was historically associated with pan-Turkism, a trend that emphasized the spiritual closeness of all people of Turkic origin, regardless of existing borders. In this respect, the German policy towards Turkey was unique, as this was a neutral country with whom Germany played a rather uncharacteristic subtle diplomatic and propaganda game. Its purpose was to tie Turkey to the Third Reich, giving it a role as "subcontractor" to control regions inhabited by peoples who historically gravitated towards Turkey. If this turned out to be impossible in the present or near future, even then the region should have been governed by Germany, with an eye to the interests of an important "shadow" player (Turkey). Germany's flirtation with Turkey and attempts to win over Soviet Turkic peoples, including those in the Caucasus, were indicative of the desperate search for allies. This, in turn, resulted from the German realization that the Wehrmacht was firmly bogged down in the course of Operation Barbarossa.

DT Article

AB In 2012 in Russia, an attempt was made at the legislative level to recognize the subjectivity of the child. In the National Strategy for Children, in force in 2012-2017, a seventh section was about the participation of children. Despite the six-year period of active existence of this document, it is difficult to consider the prevailing understanding of child participation in solving both personal and public issues. The research question is the search for the meanings of child participation and the barriers to its implementation associated with the operation of the above document. An array was selected for analysis, including 10 expert interviews, 10 scientific publications and a transcript of the round table 'Mechanisms for realizing the child's participation in resolving issues affecting his interests'. The study of the selected documents was carried out in the MAXQDA program. For all documents, a unified coding system was developed, including 17 codes and 18 subcodes. MAXQDA tools allowed a comparative analysis of selected articles in the context of codes, volumes and frequency of occurrence of codes in documents, relationships between codes. The socio-political discourse of participation is a discourse of quasi-participation, when all adult participants agree with the importance of children expressing their own opinions, but things do not go further than expressing opinions. This is due to the undeveloped mechanisms for including children in resolving various issues. The participation of children has not become the basic principle for building an entire system of measures for childhood. The developers of the National Strategy deviated from the understanding of participation laid down by the Convention.

LA English
DT Article
DE discourse; ideology; precariat; precarization; middle class
ID EMPLOYMENT
AB The article is devoted to the problematique of using the con-cept of precariat in the Russian scientific literature. Having fixed the lack of consensus about the criteria of the precariat, its social composition and even its very existence as a class, the author suggests one should proceed from the fact that precariat is part of an ideological rather than a scientific discourse, similar to the discourse of the middle class, with which it has a clear continu-ity. These discourses are functional for the reproduction of the existing social relations. Therefore, the article attempts to study discourse that is used to de-scribe precariat in Russia, and to comprehend for the reproduction of what re-lations it is functional.The research conducted by the author shows that the Russian interpre-tation of the precariat differs markedly from the Western one. This applies to both the composition of the precariat and its place in the social structure. The Russian authors draw a picture of a specific Russian precariat, which includes almost half of the society. This precariat bears little resemblance to the Western one, but almost completely coincides with the Russian middle class, as the Russian ruling circles view it. Since the state is able to conduct a dialogue with this kind of precariat, which is a passively suffering and no longer dangerous class that does not undermine the foundations of the sys-tem, the discourse about precariat and precarization is turning into the same potentially legitimate kind of normalizing discourse as the one about the middle class.

DT Article
DE Life; Izvestia; Elections; Supreme Soviet; Soviet Democracy
AB The article discusses an attempt to use the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR as a tool to promote the political advantage of socialism. The turn of the 1950s and 1960s was marked by a desire to build a dialogue between East and West. The USSR demonstrated its openness and willingness to compete with the West not only with tanks, planes and missiles, but also on a symbolic field. One such aspect of the competition, which was supposed to prove the superiority of socialism, was the Soviet elections. Soviet propaganda actively emphasized that genuine democracy existed only in the USSR. At the same time, the Soviet leadership did not at all seek to hide the features of Soviet elections (such as almost 100% turnout and no alternative elections), but rather tried to show the progressive nature of the Soviet electoral system. The articles by American journalist Hedley Donovan in the "Life" magazine and by Soviet journalist Vladimir Kudryavtsev in the "Izvestia" newspaper, which show the perception of the principles of democracy by representatives of different systems, serve as material in the paper. They show that for an American, having one candidate on the ballot overrode all the advantages of the Soviet elections, while for the Soviet side, it was an important sign of democracy. The desire to use Soviet reality as a basis for propaganda, and disappointment in the outcome of the exchange show that for the Soviet side, the election campaign for the USSR Supreme Soviet was seen not only as a political spectacle, but rather as a real manifestation of the Soviet understanding of democracy. The Soviet leadership adopted the idea of the need to lift the iron curtain, and then the very reality of the Soviet system would be the best argument to confirm the advantages of socialism. The article analyzes the political language of the description of the Soviet electoral system and the problems of modern studies of this issue.

AB The article discusses the problem of human development, the relevance of which is dictated by the requirements of modernity. In the Russian Federation, the issues of human development, along with saving the population, are considered as components of the country's national interests. The significance of their solution is emphasized in strategic documents, in particular in the National Security Strategy of the Russian Federation (Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 400 of July 2, 2021). However, the multi-subjectivity of the Russian Federation, the various possibilities of the budgets of the Russian regions, the conditions and living standards of the population of certain territories of the country, their climatic, resource and sociocultural diversity update the study of the features of human development at the local level. The aim of the article is to compare Tatarstan's approach to the accumulation of human development, laid down in the official discourse of the region, and the results of the declared policy. The study was carried out using two methods: content analysis of the Strategy for the Socio-Economic Development of the Republic of Tatarstan until 2030 and an expert survey, the participants of which were experts in economy, education, health, and ethno-cultural sphere of Tatarstan. As a result of the study, the priorities of the republic in terms of increasing human development and their application were identified. The conclusion is made about the embodiment of the majority of the declared interests of the republic. This concerns Tatarstan's guidelines for the development of education (primarily higher education), support for a diversified economy, modernization of healthcare facilities, the formation of a modern cultural environment, and the use of the region's multi-ethnicity as an investment-attractive brand of the republic. The discrepancy between the declared policy and its implementation in practice was found in terms of the tasks for increasing the birth rate, ensuring labor longevity and education competitiveness at the international level. The article proves the need to take into account risk factors as a promising direction for the deployment of the concept of human development. This is shown by revealing the impact of global, all-Russian trends and unpredictable risks on the successful expression of Tatarstan's priorities.

DE philosophy of education; educational migration; talent competition;

AB The article analyzes the role of education and the challenges faced by the domain of philosophy of education nowadays. Civilization owes its existence to the development and formation of education. The philosophy of education considers the most general foundations of education, its development and functioning. The main aim of this article is to critically undertake the value of education and analyze how it has developed from ancient times up until nowadays along the philosophy of education. One of the major challenges is represented by the increased costs assigned to education, which has become one of the most expensive and most valuable commodities and, consequently, has affected the development of countries. In fact, one of the major premises of this study is that educational resources, rather than economic ones, definitely impact the raise and evolution of a nation. A particular focus will be devoted to the correspondences and contrasts between different European educational traditions and some Russian paradigms reflected by the philosophy of education. The European liberal understanding of the philosophy of education and its reception in the Russian philosophical thought have both differences and common aspects. Both support the idea that the philosophy of education has a pronounced interdisciplinary character which should be kept as such. A special place in the field of education is occupied by the international market of educational services, which is designed to improve the demographic situation and positively influences the labor market of recipient countries, as well as contribute to the development of the general level of education of the nation. A second argument that will tailor the current research will plea for accepting the competition of talents in the modern world, which is designed to attract educational migrants. The export of education requires freedom of movement, which underlies the free competition of educational services and the worldwide exchange of knowledge. Thus, the free exchange of knowledge and its transfer will contribute to maximize innovations in the field of education, which consequently will directly support both the modernization of the educational systems and the preservation of national educational traditions.

DE Russian economic thought; proto-marginalism; David Ricardo; Yuli

ID REVOLUTION; HISTORY
AB The paper focuses on the interpretation of David Ricardo's theory of value and distribution suggested by Yuli Zhukovsky, a 19th century Russian economist. In his interpretation, Zhukovsky introduced a two-factor production model characterized by decreasing marginal productivity as well as supply-and-demand price mechanism. Zhukovsky's interpretation of Ricardo was an attempt to deliver a more rigorous approach to the agrarian issue - the hot topic that marked the public debates in Russia after the abolition of serfdom in 1861. Zhukovsky, an early critic of Marx, outlined a different path in the reception of the classical approach in Russia that preceded later developments in mathematical economics. The paper introduces Zhukovsky's interpretation as a case of proto-marginalist analysis. It also demonstrates that Zhukovsky treated the mathematical apparatus as an instrument for the practical application of political economy to the issue of economic development.

AB In the 1990s-2000s after the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the bipolar system it began to seem that the global military confrontation between the two powers left behind and that in the conditions of globalization and interdependence of all states from each other, it was impossible to return to the old rhetoric of the 20th century. However, since the second decade of the twenty-first century, it has become obvious that the logic of political realism, the solution of pressing foreign policy tasks from the point of view of purely national interests, still exists today. Even 10 years ago, many experts were skeptical about military security threats, focusing on nontraditional threats, non-military, economic, etc. Today, the issues of traditional, military security have been again topical on the agenda.
   Within the framework of this article, the problem of threats to military security in Northeast Asia is considered. The article is based on sources and materials available in open sources of information.
   The purpose of this work is to analyze modem threats to military security in Northeast Asia. The subregion of Northeast Asia due to its geopolitical, economic and institutional uniqueness has never lost the urgency of military threats even when on a global scale it seemed that they were outdated. The article analyzes the current territorial disputes in the region, and investigates one of the most pressing problems - the problem of North Korea's nuclear program. In addition, aspects such as frequent military exercises and the reformatting of military formations in the region were also reflected in the work.
   The author concludes that the current level of threats to military security is very high, and that these threats are actual. Northeast Asia is one of the most complex and explosive parts of the world space, capable of instantly plunging most of the world powers into a regional or global conflict. In addition, the author focuses on what adds a state of uncertainty and the absence of the proper institutional environment, which is observed in other regions of world politics.

AB The work is dedicated to the ideas of Karl-Otto Apel. This thinker argues that the conditionality of cognition by language and culture, revealed by modern philosophy, does not deny the possibility of the existence of universal truths. The article deals with the question of whether the concept developed by Apel can be considered a satisfactory solution to the problem of relativism in the theory of knowledge. The core of Apel's philosophy is transcendental pragmatics he developed. Its specificity lies in the fact that, while maintaining the orientation towards the search for the necessary conditions for cognition, it reveals structures in language and communication that generate the intersubjective significance of knowledge. The transcendental language game of an ideal communicative community acts as an instance that ensures the general significance of cognition. At first glance, the concept Apel developed solves the problem of relativism in epistemology. However, this theory raises a number of criticisms. Firstly, in discussing the question of the necessary conditions for objective knowledge, Apel interprets the " objective" in the spirit of the hermeneutic tradition as a general understanding of the meaning of a certain state of affairs or a general view of a certain subject. Apel considers the question of how it is possible to achieve a common view of things between representatives of different cultures. Following the notion of linguistic philosophy about the linguistic nature of being and thinking, Apel remains within the framework of the idea of cognition as an essentially historical and relative process. Secondly, transcendental pragmatics undertakes the substantiation of the ultimate principles of cognition in the horizon of the language game of the Kantian theory of cognition and the normative prescriptions for scientific cognition put forward by classical New European epistemology. In the author's opinion, Apel ontologizes the methodological guidelines of the modernist theory of knowledge. This is manifested in the fact that the principles of argumentative, aimed at rational discussion, discourse are thought of as a necessary condition for any meaningful communication. According to the author, argumentative discourse is, first, only one of the types of social communication, and, second, it is not a condition of any communication, but a normative ideal, first of all, of discussing problems in scientific communities. Thus, summing up the above and answering the question posed at the beginning of this work, it can be concluded that transcendental pragmatics does not provide a satisfactory solution to the problem of relativism in the theory of knowledge.

AB The authors hypothesize that textual information posted on personal pages on social media reflects the political views of users to some extent. Therefore, this textual information can be used to predict political views on social media. The authors conduct experiments on textual data from user pages and test two machine learning methods to classify pages that declare different political preferences. To undertake a study, the authors collected anonymous open textual data of users of the VKontakte social network (the number of pages is 10 123). Data collection was carried out using the VKontakte Application Programming Interface (VK API). As a result of the analysis of the collected data, the authors discovered two types of textual information. The first is a text filled by the user by selecting one of several possible values (binary or categorical variables). The field "Political Views" is one of these text fields, it provides nine options for selection. The second type of text information includes information entered by the user in an arbitrary form (interests, activities, etc.). The authors trained and tested two machine learning models to predict users' political views based on the remaining text information from their pages: a) linear support vector classifier using text representations from the bag-of-words model; b) neural network using Multilingual BERT text embeddings. The results show that the models sufficiently successfully perform binary classification of users who have polar political views (for example, communists - libertarians, communists - ultra-conservatives). Nevertheless, the results for the groups of users that have close political views are significantly lower. In addition, the authors investigated the assumption that users often indicate "indifferent" political views as "moderate". The authors classified the groups of users who declare indifferent or moderate views (the two largest categories in our dataset) and users who indicated other political preferences. The results demonstrate a sufficiently high performance for the classification of custom pages based on these two political views.

DT Article
DE Modenity; theomachy; revolution; cult of Peter the Great; dictatorship;
   development; leaderism; creators; victims
AB The end of the 19th - beginning of the 20th century is a watershed moment for Russia. It was the era of "theomachy", or getting rid of the former gods (authorities, restrictions, coercion and control), in politics, economy, science and culture. In this sense, the motto "Down with the autocracy!" is the political equivalent of the poets' slogan "Throw Pushkin off the ship of Modernity". Poets, like politicians, wanted to break out of the past by removing its linchpin - the tsar, the old power. Some intended to reestablish it, others - to rethink it Politicians sought their ideal in "geography" (the political structure of advanced, democratic Europe), poets - in culture. And they found it in Peter the Great - the revolutionary on the throne, the demiurge of St Petersburg's Russia. That cult, which was seemingly organic for that culture, concealed the expectations that can be politically deciphered as "the dictatorship of development". It was Peter's model of transformation (radical upheaval, a step from the past into the future, with the leader heading the process) that was adopted by the Russian culture as a normative. The revolution and the new ("October") world, with its eulogy of the future, dictatorship, and cult of the leader, have become the answer to the questions of the beginning of the century and their test.
   The article views revolution precisely as an experience (which, for all its intensity and tragic nature, has received insufficient reflection) that failed to have any impact on the subsequent political practice. At the same time, although the main goal of the study is political in nature, the author draws on literary, mostly poetic sources, showing how revolutionary practice (not only at the start, but also at the end of the century) highlights the extent to which the "irresponsible chatter" of poets was truly reflective in political and moral respects.

DT Article
DE Civil war; Soviet festivals; emotions; political cultural; conflict
AB Using the approaches of emotion researchers (primarily William Reddy's concept of emotives), the author analyzes the early history of celebrations of anniversaries of the October Revolution as a special emotional time and demonstrates the features of the language used by different people - supporters, enemies, and opponents of the Bolsheviks - when speaking about emotions experienced during the holiday. The author shows that the celebrations of anniversaries of the revolution were not only vivid artistic actions and important political events, but also a technique of emotions training The specific emotional atmosphere of the holiday made it an important political resource. Meanwhile, the holiday was a stressful time for its organizers: during the preparation of celebrations, logistical problems arose due to a lack of resources in the context of the world crisis, and there were contradictions related to what emotions the celebration of the anniversary of the revolution should evoke. This was manifested in the discussion on the correlation of the holiday and the Red Terror, and in the dispute about whether it was appropriate to recall the fallen heroes of the revolution on holidays. Not only the political environment (lack of resources, security problems, etc.), but also the features of the political culture formed a repertoire of festive emotions. This political culture, the essential elements of which (the cult of the revolutionary leader and sacralization of the revolution) began form before the Bolsheviks came to power, was a powerful force determining the situation no less than the purposive actions of specific political actors and the emerging Soviet institutions.

AB The article analyzes the experience of New economic policy (NEP), some of its features, the study of which may be helpful in solving the problems of the modern domestic economy. Certain similarities are obvious between the mixed economy of the NEP period, which V. Lenin called state capitalism, and the modern market economy with the growing role of the state. Within the framework of the chosen topic of NEP lessons, five key research areas have been identified: 1) selection of qualified personnel, 2) limitation of the excessive control system, 3) monetary policy, combining fighting inflation and stimulating economic growth, 4) a stable exchange rate of the domestic currency or devaluation; 5) attracting foreign capital. For each of these areas, the problems during the NEP period are highlighted. They were caused not only by the complexity of the economic recovery following the civil war. Contradictions in the ruling stratum of the Communist Party were also of great importance. The communists with high posts in the economy considered the development of productive forces to be the main priority and proceeded from the need to stimulate an increase in production. Party ideologists and apparatchiks, representatives of various control bodies, were guided primarily by political and ideological considerations. As a result of these contradictions, economic policy was often inconsistent. The study of the NEP experience lets us find the positive lessons that can be used in modern conditions, and those negative features that should not be repeated.

DE semantics; language; meaning; metaphor; a priori
AB This article analyzes some approaches to the phenomenon of understanding and the role of language in this matter; one of the possible reconstructions of the thesis about the absence of semantics in natural language is proposed on the basis of the well-known position of L. Wittgenstein's late philosophy that the meaning of a word is its use; As a result of some reconstructions, it was established that the a priori of meaning, being an absolutely necessary condition for one or another judgment, presents semantics in a new aspect of vision: the possibility of constructing new schemes and relations between different (sometimes multilevel) segments of reality, etc., are determined by syntactic and pragmatic structures, to the creation of which the mental space is directly related. In addition, the paper analyzes the thesis about the key role of metaphor (the approach to the metaphor is based on the concept of J. Lakoff, presented by him in his work "Women, Fire and Dangerous Things") in the process of creating new knowledge in the context of the approach: the meaning of a word is its use. This became possible on the basis of the analysis of the functioning of terminology in the language of science and the connection of the latter with natural language: the mechanism for creating analogies, images, etc. ensures the formation of a certain logic of the language, going beyond which for the subject of knowledge would guarantee the absolute impossibility of understanding. The main object of research in this article is the a priori meaning. The working hypothesis of this research boils down to the following: the missing semantics, formed by the syntactic structure of the language and corresponding to the logic of the language, constitutes new schemes of understanding, both scientific and ordinary. The purpose of this work is to substantiate the fact that one of the arguments in favor of the reality of the missing semantics is the phenomenon of metaphor. The article uses the following research methods: the method of epistemological explication and the method of cognitive analysis.

AB Political science education mainly focuses on five main areas: the operation of government, public policy, political theory, political behavior, and international relations. This article provides an educational study of comparative analysis of the codification of legislation in various legal systems. The authors analyze the features of the systematization of legislation in the countries of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon legal systems. Based on the results, it was concluded that it is the continental legal tradition that is most conducive to codification activity. The low volume of statutory legal norms in the Anglo-Saxon legal system impedes codification, but provides adequate regulatory flexibility. At the same time, recently in common law countries there has been a tendency to increase the share of statutory law in the regulation of public relations. In this regard, the importance of codification work increases in the systematization of legislation.

AB The authors focus on the ideological and epistemological changes in French studies in contemporary Russia comparing them with the historiography of the Soviet period. The study of the French history is a traditional field of research for Russian historians. For many generations of them, the history of France was the starting point in thinking about the fate of Russia. Regardless of whether the French experience was accepted as a model or rejected, interest in it remained permanent, and the study of French history was ever intensive. In the post-Soviet period, the accumulated potential of knowledge and skills of the past is actively used. At the same time, the current period is characterized by a radical turn, which led to a complete breakup with the Soviet historiography in some fundamental respects. In the ideological and ideological aspect, it took place a departure from the socialist teleology and the revolutionary paradigm of world history, in the methodological aspect it took place a departure from the monopoly of Marxism. Collectives of Russian historians and linguists have entered in the world scientific community, assimilating and using research approaches that exist in world historical science, and responding to the innovations taking place in it. New branches of historiography appeared - the historical anthropology and microhistory, the social and political history was reanimated. The research space has expanded with a focus on the problems of power, institutions and mechanisms of public administration. This movement as a whole was not without losses due to the costs of radical ideological and theoretical renewal, partial departure from the study of social structures and social movements, economic and especially agrarian history of France.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE state capacity; institutional capacities; Bayesian methods; latent
   variables; comparative dynamics; hierarchical models; ratings
AB This article endeavors to construct a composite indicator designed to facilitate the comparative assessment of institutional capacities across diverse political systems. The focal point of analysis resides within the domain of state capacity, a pivotal determinant for a myriad of inquiries that seek to evaluate the efficacy of public policy implementation across varying spheres. The attainment of the research objective materialized through the adoption of Bayesian methodologies tailored for the scrutiny of latent variables, a prevalent recourse within contemporary social sciences to address analogous empirical puzzles. Drawing upon antecedent advancements collaboratively undertaken with co-authors and a minimal selection of variables, ranging from the comprehensive gauge of control over violence to formal economic activity (reciprocally aligned with the gauge of informal economy), two distinct models were subjected to empirical examination: namely, the linear and hierarchical ones. The ensuing analysis of 150 countries across three temporal junctures (1996, 2005, and 2015) distinctly advocates for the adoption of the latter model after accommodating convergence testing. The hierarchical model, oriented towards encapsulating the tripartite dimensions of state capacity, namely administrative, coercive, and extractive facets, gains preference. This predilection aligns with the contribution of J. Hanson and R. Sigman, whose conceptual underpinnings are frequently espoused by scholars when delineating the contours of the observed construct. The hierarchical model affirms the efficacy and discriminatory acumen of the proposed approach in engendering pertinent state rankings. These empirical revelations, in turn, constitute an indispensable stride towards interrogating assorted hypotheses concerning trajectories of institutional development and the construction of classificatory frameworks delimiting state capacity. Moreover, they extend utility in the realm of comparative studies by furnishing an aggregated indicator conducive to cross -national analysis.

AB Introduction: the article is devoted to analysis of dramatic creativity of the famous Russian writer of the Komi Republic Lyubov Terentjeva. The work investigated the problematic and thematic content of the plays, their figurative system.Objective: to identify the problematic, thematic and genre originality of the plays of L. Terentjeva; to characterize the leading images and motifs of her dramatic works.Research materials: Lyubov Terentjeva's dramatic plays.Results and novelty of the research: L. Terentjeva's plays are a vivid example of women's literature. They are devoted to the traditional for this literature theme of family, childhood, and love. The focus of L. Terentjeva's attention is a woman, her life, relationships with relatives, the world around her, dreams, desires, emotions. The dramatist's plays reflect the gender relations of the late XX century; they depict the aspirations of some heroines to personal self-realization, for a radical change in their lives, attempts to escape from everyday problems. Other heroines desire to arrange a family life, to preserve the fam-ily hearth. During the period of socio-political changes, especially at the turn of the XX-XXI centuries, it was the institution of the family that was subjected to various kinds of difficulties, including destruction. Her plays are evidence of the renewal of the scenic literature of the Komi region, the desire of the dramaturgy of the region to develop new themes, characters, genres. The problems of women's fate raised by the writer in the modern world harmoniously enter the dramaturgy of the Komi Republic in the future, already in the XXI century, contributing to the development of this theme in the works of other authors of the region - N. Kuratova, E. Kozlova, N. Obrezkova, V. Lekanova. Their plays also addressed the problem of a woman. In the context of Finno-Ugric literature, some parallels are observed between the plays of L. Terentjeva and the dramaturgical works of the Mordovian writer V. Mishanina

DE behaviorism; educational practices; ethics; learning
AB The article reviews the history of the behavioral learning theory in order to examine the behavioristic approach for its compliance with standards of modern educational practices. It follows the development of behaviorism from early essays of John B. Watson's to B.F. Skinner's works and Noam Chomsky's criticism. It shows how the behavioristic refusal from the introspection method and neglect of cognition led to significant ethical problems such as the Little Albert Experiment and parental emotional coldness of a whole generation that followed Watson's advice on child rearing. The article also reveals that ignoring the introspection method might lead behaviorists to wrong conclusions even if their methods were not unethical. The article unveils how ethical problems and other flaws of the behavioristic approach, which originated from neglecting cognitive processes, prevent contemporary educational researchers from using behavioral learning methods wider in their works. The conclusion is made that behavioristic methods could become a part of modern educational practices under the condition of respect towards the introspection method and cognition. In this case, the following questions should be answered: (1) Is the learning process, suggested by educational practice, subjectively comfortable for a student? Does this practice cause rejection to the process and the subject of learning? Does the teaching method contain techniques that can cause negative consequences for students' physical and mental health? (2) How long will the learning effect last after the subjectively perceived negative reinforcement disappears? (For example, for some students negative reinforcement equals to bad grades, for others to the fear of their own incompetence). (3) What positive reinforcement techniques can be used to make learning outcomes subjectively meaningful to a learner? (For example, the desire to get a good grade can be a positive reinforcement for a student, but outside of school, the knowledge gained through such reinforcement can often be forgotten). Thereby, the combination of two approaches - behaviorism and cognitive psychology, which were once parted, can bring efficient results in improving and creating contemporary educational practices.

DE Catholicism; growth poles; spatial expansion; China; Holy See;

AB The article is devoted to the development of Catholicism in China. The broad chronological framework (the 14th - first half of the 20th centuries) makes it possible to determine the nature of its spatial expansion. The attention is paid to the geographical logic of the Roman Catholic Church progress within China. The territorial and organizational structure of Catholicism in the country included the main core located in Northern China and covering the historical Zhili province with the center in Beijing and the adjacent regions of Inner Mongolia, Shandong and Shanxi. It was distinguished by the highest number and density of the Catholic population, as well as the greatest concentration of administrative-territorial institutions (units) of the Roman Catholic Church, clergy and religious infrastructure. The four cores of the second order, which had a smaller number and density of the Catholic population, were: the Jiangsu province with the main centers in Shanghai and Nanjing in the east, Hubei in the center, Guangdong with the greatest concentration of Catholics in the Pearl River Delta in the south, and Sichuan in the west. Considering both the population and the political side of the network of the Roman Catholic Church institutions in China, the authors conclude that the structure was in need of institutional consolidation from the Holy See, which could give the status of dioceses to its temporary administrative units in China - apostolic vicariates, uniting them into ecclesiastical provinces metropolises. Until this happened, the unity of the space of Catholicism in China could not be ensured, since each apostolic vicariate was directly subordinate to the institution of the Roman Curia, the Congregation for the Propaganda of the Faith, responsible for missionary activities.

AB This paper proposes a systems-theoretical approach to the role of guanxi-based, amakudari-based and other traditional practices, founded on group loyalty and supervisor-subordinate relationships, in making transitions from authoritarian rule. There are a lot of examples of unsuccessful transitions in Orient and non-Western cultures and of the degradation of new democracies in Eastern-European and Asian States. Many hybrid or semi-democracies fall short in the provision of public services or the protection of economic or human rights. Younger democracies are more corrupt, exhibit less rule of law, uncompetitive elections, uncontrolled bureaucracy, shrinked individual freedoms and may slide to authoritarianism through populism. And there are also the well-known problems of collective and civil actions to provide collective goods. In non-Western States collective action adheres to traditions and indigenous forms of group loyalty. The traditional ways for realizing individual interests are based on patron-client relations in these societies. And from this point of view such relations appear to be the most reliable way of satisfying individual interests of gaining advantages from Power than fighting for common goods and civil values through the transition to a more democratic regime, including substantive political changes moving towards a fair distribution of common goods. The goal of the author is to identify the dependence of the changing behavior of individuals to components of engagement in patron-client relations. Traditional patron-client (superior-subordinate) relations as a structuring social exchange are based on some variables, such as benefits\contributions, loyalty, reciprocity, personal commitment, obligation, subordinate, collectivism, personal-life inclusion etc. The model helps to explain what variables change someone's behavior from seeking civil values and common goods to prioritising individual or groups' benefits relating to the patron-client relationships in non-Western cultures.

DE judicial review; constitutional court; ombudsman
ID HORIZONTAL ACCOUNTABILITY
AB In most countries, the main task of the constitutional court is to review compliance with the constitution. The basic method to perform this task is the elimination of violations upon an external request: after the court receives from applicants information about such violations in the form of claims or requests, it assesses the validity of such claim/requests and makes a decision on the particular issue that was brought up by an applicant, thereby restoring the constitutional order within the legal sphere in question. It is clear that one properly functioning court does not suffice for the successful realization of such a review model. One needs the coherent ecosystem of court helpers, who would collect relevant information about violations and supply it to judges - practically like raw materials, without which judicial control is impossible.
   The article analyzes the relationship of the Russian Constitutional Court with a specific type of such helpers - the Ombudsman. Based on the quantitative analysis of the database of the decisions of the Constitutional Court, the author traces the evolution of these relations over the time period from 1999 to the present day and attempts to identify the reasons why, despite the growing "friendliness" of the Constitutional Court towards the Ombudsman, the role of the latter in the judicial review is declining.

AB Based on analysis of philosophical works by Rabindranath Tagore, the article presents a reconstruction of his understanding of meanings and processes of India's history. Tagore's approach to native history is determined his striving for discovery of its real content in juxtaposition with other countries and civilizations. Anthropologically, the key historiosophical idea by Tagore is an idea of human freedom embodied in history of civilizations in many aspects, therefore, he understands history as an orientation for future. Tagore had created special philosophy of Indian history as history of her social life, spirit and culture. The general understanding of India's history by R. Tagore had united idea of `Greater India' - ancient civilization with outstanding ability to integrate all peoples and to resolve conflicts, as well as ideas of striving to harmonic 'unity in diversity' in history as its goal and ideal, of political and economic evolution as the background. Cultural and spiritual life ground main heritage and perspective of development of India.

AB The first philosophical conception of Indian history created by Swami Vivekananda is reconstructed in the article. Theoretically, the philosopher tried to resolve a 'super-problem' of finding the meaning of the whole historical process along with its origin and goal. His general view on world history presents it as the history of human spirit and peoples' spiritual development in time. Based on his own scheme of social-historical development through the changes of the varnas' power (priests, royals, traders, common people), Vivekananda interprets Indian history as different epochs of the classes' domination in society. In many-sides history of India philosopher emphasizes its core - history of spirit, thought and religions, its derivatives are the social and cultural processes - class domination and subjection. Political history is the outer form of internal Indian history. Vivekananda had created special philosophy of Indian history, whose meaning he interpreted as solving key problems of human existence and being and longing to see the eternal and one truth in diversity of natural and social world.

AB Introduction. The paper examines Argentina-U.S. relations during the administrations of Mauricio Macri and Alberto Fernandez, as well as the transformation of the bilateral ties character at the turn of the decade. The author analyzes the changes paying attention to the challenges that the economic crisis posed to the Argentine leaders, and taking into account the motives of both countries. The study identified the risks for the successful interaction between Washington and Buenos Aires, as well as the leverage of the potential influence of the White House on the Argentine authorities. Methods. The study is based on extensive factual data from the period of the latest two Argentine administrations (2015-2021), the new sources, including documents of the U.S. Department of State. An integrated systematic approach allowed to consider the interaction of Buenos Aires and Washington in the dynamics of Argentine domestic political and economic processes, taking into account global and regional factors. When analyzing changes in the character of bilateral ties, a comparative approach was applied. Analysis. The relations between Washington and the government of Mauricio Macri in 2017-2019 were allied. The main areas of interaction were trade and investment, security and political cooperation. To support his ally and the continuity of government in Argentina, D. Trump facilitated the IMF 's approval of the largest standby to Argentina for the period of Macri's administration. The problem of payment became a burden for the elected A. Fernandez. Results. The willingness of the White House to help resolve the debt issue and the American investments needed by Argentina deterred A. Fernandez from developing an autonomist foreign policy pushing him to choose a more balanced course. Both topics constitute the points of potential pressure from Washington on the Argentine leader. Bilateral relations became more restrained, but showing no signs of confrontation. Risks for Argentine-American cooperation are posed by the deepening partnership of the South American country with China and by the position of the Argentine authorities on resolving the Venezuelan crisis. Given its desire to be Argentina's partner of choice, the U.S. is unlikely to firstly use pressure. With the beginning of Joseph Biden's presidency, the climate agenda became a new area of cooperation.

SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Political Philosophy; political concepts; rationality; institutions;
   ideas
AB The monograph written by Kirill Koktysh is devoted to the issues of constructing languages of Political Science. These languages are di-verse, but the author analyzes them through three basic concepts - rational-ism, institutions and ideas. Masterfully combining a limited number of con-cepts, he builds a large-scale construction, showing in detail how one can study languages for describing politics.
   According to Koktysh, the rational is constructed by specific institu-tions. He identifies three institutions that go back to the three functions of the Indo-European gods, highlighted by Georges Dumezil. These institutions correspond to the three functions of politics - "leader" (makes decisions), "priest" (forms and maintains norms) and "merchant" (is engaged in eco-nomic reproduction). These institutions seek to extend their rationality to the society at large, using for this purpose three "big ideas" - order, justice, and freedom. According to the author's conclusion, the institutions of the leader and the priest form the basis of stable social conditions - "political architec-tures", and it is the relations between them that determine the specifics of such "architectures". At the same time, the book pays attention not only to statics, but also to dynamics. The cognitive-structural method used by the author al-lows him to explore the transformations of the societies through the analysis of changes in rationalism, institutions and ideas.
   Koktysh's book is valuable not only due to the novelty of its research question and fundamental nature, but also because it outlines important direc-tions for further discussion. One of these directions concerns the popular criti-cism of the Enlightenment, with which the author agrees, as well as the justi-fication for reducing rationality to mere derivatives of certain social contexts. Another direction for a discussion is about the evaluation of the Anglo-Ameri-can model of democracy, which is denied the ability to produce generally valid meanings. In many ways, this book per se represents a significant contribution to a rational discussion of politics, convincingly demonstrating how complex and elusive the concepts of Political Science are.

   RESEARCH JOURNAL

DT Article
DE Arctic; science diplomacy; Arctic Council; foreign policy; Arctic
   strategies; public diplomacy
AB Arctic science diplomacy (ASD) is both a relatively new topic and an acute issue in Russian academic and political circles. There is neither a clear definition of the concept nor a consensus on the stakeholders, tools, and activities of science diplomacy. This article focuses on the main approaches in Russia in relation to the concept of ASD. The first approach considers ASD as a soft power tool of regional players. Science diplomacy helps to promote a positive image of specific states and to gain access to non-state resources that are usually inaccessible to state actors. A technical/instrumentalist approach to ASD involves the use of academic and scientific-technical cooperation between regions, countries, and societies to create reliable international partnerships on a non-ideological basis and to solve generally significant world problems. The third direction considers ASD as a form of new diplomacy, the strategic goal of which is not only to build friendly relations and cooperation with all Arctic countries, but also to develop international scientific cooperation and improve the international image of Russia.
   This analysis makes it possible to explain the strategic motives and driving forces of ASD and to identify the stakeholders and key forms of Russia's ASD. It is established that the majority of the participants of ASD share the idea that international scientific cooperation in order to ensure the sustainable development of the Arctic can become an effective mechanism for solving the most acute problems of the region, as well as for improving the current relations of Western countries with Russia. The authors believe that Russia has largely managed to form the necessary platforms for the implementation of both strategic and tactical goals of its ASD. These platforms include both national platforms (the international forum "The Arctic: The Territory of Dialogue" and "The Arctic: Present and Future") and the active use of international platforms ("Arctic Frontiers," "Polar Circle," and "Arctic Science Summit Week") and organizations such as the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), the International Arctic Social Sciences Association (IASSA), and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS).

AB The article presents a critical analysis of the interpretation of the political philosophy of Karl Marx in the book by Levi del Aguila Marchena, a Peruvian philosopher working at the Pontifical Catholic University in Lima (Senior Professor and Chair of the Department of Management Sciences at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru). The work has been published in the international series Marx, Engels, and marxisms. The starting point of her critical analysis was the polymorphic and somewhat pretentious concept of "the Dualism of Realms", characterizing, according to the author of the book, the utopian interpretations in Marxist political philosophy of the problems of the state, individual freedom and ways of its realization. In the book, in essence, only one plot is "played out", which is constantly present on many dozens of pages, namely, the identification of Marx's "initial contradictions", the cause of which the author considers the "indestructible inertia" of liberalism in his political philosophy. In our opinion, Aguila Marchena set himself an extremely difficult and thankless task, given the large number of opponents both among modern supporters of Marxism, which is quite understandable, and in academic science. It is probably for this reason that the author prefers not to get involved in modern scientific controversy and in the final chapters completes his reconstruction "all alone". As a result, the rethinking of the theme of personality/free state in Marx's philosophy, which the author obviously considers a contribution to science, looks one-sided and dogmatic.

ID CENTENARY
AB The article analyses the influence of the realities of Soviet reality on the fate of the scientific and technical intelligentsia during the industrialisation of the country. The central figure of the study is a major party worker and statesman, vice-president of the USSR Academy of Sciences, chairman of the GOELRO Commission and the Gosplan created on its basis, the main ideologist of domestic energy development, the creator and permanent director of the Energy Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences, G.M. Krzhizhanovskiy.
   The thematic basis of the context of the article is the objective and subjective circumstances that complicated the state and research activities of Krzhizhanovskiy. The prelude to the plot "Krzhizhanovskiy against sabotage" is a note by the deputy chairman of the Joint State Political Directorate, G.G. Yagoda, about the scale of counter-revolutionary actions in the country, addressed to I.V. Stalin (1933). The document allows us to understand the reasons why the authors focused their attention on the situation that had developed by the end of the 1920s, when the anti-sabotage campaign began to grow in the country. The article analyses the circumstances and chronicle of Krzhizhanovskiy's active involvement in the processes of identifying saboteurs: accusatory reports made on the eve of the trial of the Industrial Party, incriminating publications with invectives against specific specialists, as well as a detailed formulation of the concept of "sabotage", which "cleaned up" the way to large-scale judicial arbitrariness.
   Within a cause-and-effect format the study considers both the reputational losses of Krzhizhanovskiy, due to his involvement in the fight against "sabotage", and the simultaneous preservation of all titles and posts for him, the subsequent repeated awarding of the highest state awards.
   The authors do not give unambiguous assessments of the behavior of the hero, providing such an opportunity to the reader. At the same time, they claim that Krzhizhanovskiy has always been in demand by the authorities and found a common language with them, and the inevitable mistakes and sins in no way detract from the significance and scale of what this, undoubtedly, bright and talented person has done.
   The article uses the publications of the journals "Planned Economy", the works of Krzhizhanovskiy published in the 1930s, as well as the rarely and fragmentally cited works of V.I. Lenin and I.V. Stalin.

AB China's economic, military and political growth led to the transformation of its identity. China's new role in world politics and its emerging identity made scholars look for a suitable model for the rising China's possible future hegemony. This article examines one of these models - the "humane authority" of Yan Xuetong, in comparison with the American model of hegemony described in the work of Zbigniew Brzezinski. The comparative analysis is based on the following parameters: interpretation of hegemony and the foundations of world leadership; attitude towards alliances and allies; international order and international norms; as well as the political and time context where both theories emerged.

DE Ulrich Beck; risk society; risk culture; globalization
AB The article analyzes how theoretically, methodologically and empirically it is possible to open the theory of society and politics to a historically new, intertwined modernity that cancels its own foundations. The author shows how in the discourse of Ulrich Beck's philosophy, the concept of a risk society does not stand in isolation. Rather, it is just a component (although extremely important, perhaps even central) of an even more comprehensive theory, namely the so-called theory of "reflexive modernization". That is why the risk society should be understood, taking into account the comprehensive completeness of Beck's philosophy: it is the intersection of two different eras of modernity. The goal of people should be to overcome the risk society with the help of reflexive modernization and, thus, finally enter the normative target state of the second modern. It is the theory, the theory of society and politics, that can reveal the fundamental fragility and variability of social dynamics that come from the globalization of capital and risks at the beginning of the 21st century. It should be remembered that risks are the result of the process of social construction. However, with the development of mass media and the publicly accessible, worldwide Internet, it is not the abstract risks themselves that are perceived as threatening, but their concrete thematization in the media. This leads to the fact that reality is perceived cognitively in accordance with the schematism of safety and danger. However, paradoxically, the inflation of "perceived risks" also leads to greater indifference. Criticism of Beck's philosophy, based on the argument of the limitation of Beck's works in time and space, is refuted by his later works, such as "World at Risk". Beck expanded some aspects of the concept, which he only hinted at in 1986, and also developed the theory from the point of view of advanced globalization. He did not blame or defend capitalism, but rather pointed out measures to reduce and eliminate risks. Risk always has two sides: the negative side of danger and the positive side of opportunity. That is why in today's society, risk management provides potential scenarios for the future and tools for better risk control.

DT Editorial Material
DE special military operation; partial mobilization; RF President; public
   administration system; civil society; elections; public opinion
AB Eight months have passed since the RF President announced the launch of a special military operation on the territory of Ukraine (February 24, 2022); thus, currently Russia is facing a global political situation that has become more turbulent. Difficulties on the front line, frequent terrorist attacks, military aid to the Kiev regime from NATO countries - all this urged the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the RF Armed Forces to make tough but necessary decisions that could not but affect the majority of Russian society. The paper analyzes key events related to the special military operation, as well as the decisions promptly taken by the President in accordance with the requirements of the time and the situation on the front line. We focus on some of the President's decisions, such as the announcement of partial military mobilization (September 21, 2022); amendments to the RF Criminal Code aimed to strengthen discipline in the army and society during martial law and wartime (September 24, 2022); accession of new territories to Russia - the Donetsk People's Republic, the Lugansk People's Republic, the Kherson and Zaporozhye oblasts (October 5, 2022); large-scale precision missile strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure, military communications and command posts (October 10, 2022); introduction of martial law in the new constituent entities of the Russian Federation and the establishment of special measures to ensure security of all regions of the Russian Federation (19 October 2022). We analyze public opinion trends and the results of the Single Voting Day (September 11, 2022), which are considered as indicators of public sentiment in the hard times that our country is facing. On the whole, our research has shown that the alarming political situation on the global arena, as well as the tough decisions adopted by the head of state in recent months, revealed new features in Russian civil society, provoked changes in the people's internal awareness of the scale of threats to national security. This, in particular, was expressed in the following: many Russians are participating in the special military operation as volunteers; volunteer aid is increasing; in society, there is strong condemnation of those who left Russia after the start of the special operation; all the social strata are consolidating around the RF President; the above trends are observed in the dynamics of public opinion assessments. All these factors can play an important role in Russia's crossing its internal Rubicon in the form of the reorientation of broad strata of Russian society, and above all its elite groups, from the Western development dogmas imposed during the 30th anniversary of the market transformation toward nationally oriented goals and values.

DE state and market; global capitalism; the conflict of elites; the crisis

AB On February 17th, 2022, the journal "Mir Rossii" organized a round table discussion based on Yakovlev's article "Where is Global Capitalism Heading?". It was motivated by two circumstances. The first, an exclusively formal one, was the extraordinary amount of attention it attracted among the readership (as judged by the download statistics). The second was a more legitimate one and had to do with the thought-provoking ideas and questions the article raised which could not but spark a heated discussion.
   The round table took place one week before the start of the special military operation in Ukraine. The discussion, however, revealed explicitly that the research community anticipated the coming global crisis, its scale, and its manifestations in the economic, social, and political dimensions. The timing of this round table meant that the emotional assessment of the situation did not prevail over the analytical one. Still, the heat of the discussion, the straightforwardness and, at times, the rigidity of many arguments related to the foreseeable development of capitalism made it clear that a crisis scenario with global consequences was highly likely.
   The round table has become a part of the intellectual record of our age and an intellectual provocation, involving new scientists into the discussion of where capitalism is heading and whether "the end of history" is indeed possible.

TI THE EVOLUTION OF METAPHYSICS OF SEX IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF SERGEI
   BULGAKOV: FROM IDEALIZATION OF THE ANDROGYNE TO THEIR CRITICISM
SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO
   UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY
   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA Russian
DT Article
DE androgyne; gender; virginity; metaphysics of sex; masculine and feminine
AB The article compares the metaphysics of sex in the early and late philosophy of Sergei Bulgakov. At the early stage, Bulgakov perceived sex of a person as a half, which should find integrity in an androgynous marriage. He criticized a person's escaping from marriage and family, believing that in most cases it is insincere and comes from disappointment and fear. The nature of sex is fundamentally damaged by the Fall, which determines the kind of the suffering associated with it and encourages a person to avoid them. However, but for exceptional circumstances of the rarest cases of "odd spirits," the integrity of sex can only be achieved in the married life of a man and a woman. At a later stage in his philosophy, Bulgakov revises his views on human sex: it becomes a faded reflection of the transcendental Masculine and Feminine principles in the Divine. A person is tasked with purifying and sublimating these principles in oneself, which is achieved by a chaste life in virginity, which Bulgakov again opposes to life in marriage. The later Bulgakov gives preference to celibacy, arguing that marriage does not help to solve the problem of sex. In addition, in his later views, Bulgakov criticizes the ideal of the androgyne. He believes that the androgyne is only deceptively integral; in fact, it destroys the selfsufficiency of each of the sexes in itself. In both early and later views, Bulgakov goes beyond the canonical Christian views on the issues of marriage and virginity, opposing these paths to each other and valorizing one of them in comparison with the other. In his early and later philosophy, Bulgakov denies the middle way of platonic love outside of marriage, believing that it is self-deception and results in a person's inflaming their passions for nothing, and not overcoming them. The article concludes that, in the context of modern gender problems, it is useful to rethink Bulgakov's philosophy in order to return to sex its metaphysical foundations which were lost in modern discourse. Understanding of these foundations gives a modern person the possibility to realize sex not only as a limitation, but also as a capability that allows fulfilling one's inner spiritual potential. It is this possibility that is denied by gender theories, which extinguish sex of its deep essence. Returning a spiritual basis to sex allows overcoming the modern person's alienation from oneself.

AB 1920s were marked by increased international interest in the history of science and technology. In the Soviet Union, this interest coincided with the spread of Marxism and the implementation of the Marxist project of social reconstruction. The Second International Congress on the History of Science and Technology, held in London from June 29 to July 4, 1931, became an important milestone in the international recognition of Soviet developments in the field of the history of science. By this time, Soviet leadership had already begun to exercise control over international contacts and the activities of Soviet scientists. Therefore, the Soviet delegation, headed by N.I. Bukharin, was actually involved in the growing ideological confrontation between the Western and Soviet social systems, which manifested itself in the context of scientific meetings and discussions. This article, based on the analysis of documents from the Russian archives, reveals how the reports made by the members of the Soviet delegation upon their return to the USSR form a dichotomous perception of the work of the international forum and construct a value judgment about the advantages of Soviet Marxism in the study of history of science. Using the sociological models of groupings by type "us - them" and "established - outsiders" allows us to find out how the political priorities and ideological attitudes of Soviet Marxists crystallized within the framework of academic confrontation between scientific approaches to the history of science.

This article revises the concept of political development, uses its meaning to analyze political processes that have been taking place since the beginning of reforms and the opening up of China. It argues that an integral mechanism of political development is the regulation of the alignment of relations in political power, which contributes to the economic and social development of the country and to finding solutions to major national issues. Analyzing political processes in China over 40 years of reform through the new lense of the concept of political development, the authors note that after the three stages of political development, the political system has been reformed and explored in many ways in accordance with various situations and tasks of economic and social development. The political development of China has become an important support and guarantee of economic and social progress. Its main experience lies in the fusion of political unity and political vitality, the unified leadership of the country while sharing political power.

AB Introduction. This study analyzes the anti-crisis policy of the southern Russian regions during the three waves of the pandemic, and also assesses the nature of its change as the corona crisis develops. It was important to identify how the regional anti-crisis policy determines the choice of mechanisms and tools for solving the problems of socio-economic development of regions. Methodology and methods. The analysis was carried out in accordance with the methodology proposed by G. Buckert, in the following areas of anti-crisis management: monitoring, training, decision-making, coordination, communication, leadership and recovery potential. The following methods were used to conduct the study: context analysis - a qualitative analysis of documents adopted by regional authorities; quantitative analysis - analysis of socio-economic indicators that reflect the reactions of the economy to decisions made by regional authorities. Analysis.The study showed that regardless of the strength of the impact of the corona crisis and the extent of the damage caused, the content of the policy of the regional authorities can be characterized as "following the center", which is largely due to the desire to avoid responsibility for the consequences of decisions made. At the first stages of the development of the corona crisis, the goals of containing the spread of coronavirus and state support for the most affected sectors of the economy from the introduction of restrictive measures were the priority. Starting from the second and subsequent waves of the pandemic, the introduction of various measures related to the mass vaccination of the population has become a key area of regional policy. Results. The key problem of the implementation of regional policy measures is identified - inefficient information work of regional authorities, which led to information asymmetry with the increased influence of the media on the social moods of citizens. It is concluded that in order to increase the efficiency of regional policy implementation measures in order to increase the sustainability of regional development, it is important that the ongoing coordination interactions between the authorities at different levels of government have clear goals for restoring the regional economy, and restorative measures should be prioritized with the supply maintenance policy.

The authors use archaeographic method of research to acquaint the scientific community with important historic documents; make assumptions on methods of retranslation and further transfer of information; describe formation of archival collections of the Russian agents' reports of the Russo-Japanese War period. Russian Ministry of Finance, which played an important role in strengthening of Russian influence in the Far East, developed a network of agents who supplied information from China, Korea, and Japan. Their reports allowed Russia to improve its politics in the region. There were struggles for domination in the region at the turn of the 20th century. Information from ministerial agents was of greatest importance in the period of Russo-Japanese War, which was to establish the political leader in the region. A.I. Pavlov happened to be a central link of the agents' network, having made right connections in his diplomatic career in Korea in 1898-1904. His net of agents, consisting of Japanese Foreign Department officials, diplomats, journalists, allowed him to inform the Ministry of Finance of situation in the Japanese army and navy, of the enemy's war budget expenses, of prevailing moods in the Japanese society. Accuracy of data, report on transfers of high-ranking Japanese military officials, description of intrigue in top military circles displayed A. I. Pavlov's excellent knowledge and, to some extent, compensated for inexperience of the emerging Russian military intelligence. Value of his data may be proved by the fact that his reports were analyzed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and passed on to the Emperor. His diplomatic methods helped to develop a moral climate in the region, which was quite favorable to Russia. The published documents demonstrate the "behind the scenes" of the war, highlight new pages of one of the most dramatic events in the Russian history.

AB Introduction. The purpose of this work is to study the gender aspect of Vietnam's public policy, to identify the real picture of women's political participation in the public administration system of modern Vietnam. The methodological basis is an interdisciplinary approach that allowed us to consider the evolution of Vietnam's gender policy, the peculiarities of gender stereotypes of Vietnamese culture, to analyze the documentary base, which included the decisions of the Communist Party of Vietnam on gender equality and the advancement of women (No. 178 / Decision-TTg), the scientific project "Women in public administration today - 2020"; statistical data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Vietnam, the National Action Plan for Sustainable Development for the period up to 2030 (No. 622 / QD-TTg). Analysis. The historical and religious causes of gender inequality in Vietnamese society, including the importance of gender stereotypes in the perception of female leaders by the public consciousness, are investigated. Based on statistical data, the ratio of men and women in the leadership pool of state power in Vietnam, as well as the reasons preventing an increase in the number of women in the leadership of state and political power, are considered. Results. The results obtained indicate the fundamental nature of the legal framework of Vietnam on gender equality, the active formation of various mechanisms for the implementation of the National Strategy for Gender Equality. However, it is noted that its implementation is still formal due to the incompleteness of the institutionalization of the legal framework on this issue, the presence of various forms of hidden discrimination, socio-psychological, religious attitudes, as well as gender stereotypes. The results of the analysis indicate the need to create a system of monitoring and control over the implementation of gender programs, more active use of international experience, integration into regional personnel policy plans, the task of increasing the female leadership. The contribution of the authors. The concept of the article, its theoretical and methodological analysis, general editing belongs to T.V. Karadzhe. The collection and systematization of the regulatory framework, the resolutions of the Communist Party and the Government of Vietnam, the analysis of statistical data on the participation of women in state and political structures was carried out by Chan Thi Mi Ngoc.

AB The problems of automation of research activities are considered, primarily from the perspective of the epistemic potential of gaining new scientific knowledge without the participation of a human as a subject of science. The bases of automation are considered from the standpoint of jointly working methodological approaches to cognition: empiricism and logical positivism. The author shows that scientific empiricism and positivism, the structural tissue in the intellectual Western thought, predetermine foundation of science automation. He analyzes the reasons for the need to eliminate the subject in mathematics and science through the hierarchy of a formal-axiomatic approach, a semantic view, and computational technologies. The current state of mathematics is shown as a confrontation between two opposite approaches: axiomatic and analytical. The axiomatic approach allows and stimulates the automation of science and the elimination of a human as a subject of science. The analytical approach defends the position of the fundamental impossibility of automating science. The author evaluates the role of a human in the new conditions of scientific activity, in which the main part of epistemic categories is delegated to computational algorithms in the system of automated science. These categories are based on Mieke Boon's list, which he compiled while investigating the impact of machine learning on the automation of science.

DE predictions; the collapse of the USSR; economy of the USSR; the
   political system of the USSR; slowdown in the economic and technological
   development of the USSR in the 60-70s
AB The works of Soviet scientists who warned in the 60-70 years about the possibility of the collapse of the USSR are analyzed. In the book "Will the USSR live to 1984?", published in 1969, historian Andrei Amalrik identified the causes of the possible collapse of the USSR (the elimination of the most active and capable from the life and composition of the ruling class, the decrepitude of the regime, the degradation of morality and deideologization) and even named its approximate dates. In a note to the leaders of the government party dated March 19, 1970, physicists Sakharova and Turchin and historian Medvedev showed the slowdown in the sixties in the USSR of economic development and technological progress, the standard of living of the population, the growing lag in these areas from developed capitalist countries. They linked these phenomena with the lack of freedom of thought and creativity, political freedoms. The economist and historian Akhiezer analyzed the history of Russia and, based on the revealed cyclical development of Russia and the huge factual material about political and economic development, predicted perestroika and its collapse, accompanied by the collapse of the USSR. Khanin produced alternative estimates of the dynamics of the economic development of the USSR and its factors by a number of methods. A steady decline in the pace of economic development and resource efficiency has been revealed since the seventh five-year plan. On this basis, a significant reduction in the national income of the USSR was predicted from the mid-80s. B.N. Mikhalevsky, head of the Forecasting Department of the Central Research Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences, in 1967 made a forecast of the development of the Soviet economy for the next 10-15 years. Based on an in-depth analysis of the structure of the Soviet economy and real inflation figures, it predicted a decline in industrial production and the standard of living of the population while maintaining the previous economic policy. It is shown that the authors of forecasts of the possible collapse of the USSR were either persecuted or their opinion was ignored. It is shown that ignoring warnings about the possible collapse of the USSR is explained by the authoritarian nature of the Soviet social system, the low intellectual level of the Soviet leadership of the 60s and 70s, and fears of losing power. The article analyzes the appearance of the authors of warnings about the collapse of the USSR.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Tuva; Mongolia; Communist International; Communist University of the
   Toilers of the East; political elites
AB The article examines how citizens of Tuva and Mongolia studied at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East (Kommunisticheskii Universitet Trudyashchikhsia Vostoka, KUTV, Moscow, USSR) in the 1920s and 1930s. To cover their tuition, a specialized Mongolian-Tuvan sector has been set up at the University.
   Mongolian students first joined the University in 1922, while their Tuvan counterparts first arrived three years later, in 1925. At first, the Mongolian students were much more numerous, but by 1930 both communities have got more equal in size, with about 200 Tuvans and 250 Mongolians. Student selection was a more or less persistent and goal-directed process, with the majority of students lacking in literacy but members of the Revolutionary Youth Union (Revsomol) or the People's Party. The intelligentsia-to-be was supposed to appropriate the ideals and values of socialism and spread them among the people in their countries, thus becoming part of their political elites.
   Setting up the Momgolian-Tuvan sector was no easy task. Among the known difficulties to overcome were the discrepancies in the levels of education of the students, the absense of learning materials in both languages and the poor command of Russian. Learning plans and syllabi were built to cover 3 or 4 years of tuition - more than in any other "foreign sector" of the KUTV. Teaching days were full of tension for every student, most of whom suffered from learning fatigue and sharp drops in concentration at the end of the term. Many failed to graduate.
   On the whole, the sector occupied a special place within the University. The Mongolian and Tuvan students had no need to study under strict secrecy rules. On returning to their home countries after graduation, they could immediately help in state and party building. As a result, when the KUTV split in 1936, the sector remained part of the University where Tuvans and Mongolians studied together with their Soviet counterparts. When the University finally folded in 1938, the sector was subsumed by the Narimanov Institute of Oriental Studies.

AB The article analyzes views of Western researchers on major epidemic outbreaks of plague that occurred in the historical past. Special attention is paid to the practice of work with indirect data taken from paleogenetics, as well as probability theory, sociology and climatology. Understanding the data obtained allowed us not only to move to macro-regional studies, but also to significantly expand the source base of the topic. The results obtained in this way allowed historians (N.V. Devitt, M. Green, M.B.S. Campbell) to resolve a number of the most controversial questions. The main ones concerned: the region of origin and date of major plague epidemics; factors that contributed to the spread of these disasters; chronological and geographical boundaries; the main changes in the socio-economic and socio-political relations of the studied macro-regions. In fact, we are talking about the beginning of a process of radical revision of the dogmas and ideas that have been established since the Middle ages about major plague epidemics in the historical past.

AB This article analyzes the problem of using new game solutions (gamification) in the modern educational process. The author insists that the introduction of gamification has a definitely positive value, since it allows the modern education system to correspond to the complex and dynamic realities of the information society. The article concludes that gamification today is one of the most effective educational technologies aimed at introducing new game solutions into the educational process while maintaining a competent and careful attitude to the content of the disciplines studied. Gamification helps to strengthen motivation among students, develop skills to quickly master new information, and apply the knowledge gained to solve specific practical problems. In addition, gamification contributes to the development of critical thinking as a new standard of open rationality to the greatest extent reflecting the modern type of thinking and the new paradigm of education. Gamification can also and should be considered in a broader context, not only as a factor in the development of the educational process, but also as a factor in the development of civil society, consisting of free and educated individuals who have the skills of a critical attitude to manipulations of all kinds.

AB The article presents the results of a bibliographic and thematic review of the "empowerment" category, the history, key directions and main characteristics of the "empowerment" approach. The empowerment-approach is successfully applied in the world of science and the practice of empowerment of individual, communities, organizations, certain social groups, (women, youth, older people, workers, consumers, patients, minorities, etc.) in psychology, sociology, social work, healthcare, pedagogy, management, politics, economics, technical sciences, and in interdisciplinary discourses. The concept is rarely used in Russian scientific discourse; in political research, it is understood as a struggle for rights and powers, and social and political activism; in pedagogical research and in social work, it is considered as an activation and expansion of the potential resources. There is a wide range of interpretations and discussion of the concept as a goal, value, principle, process, result, method, technology, and strategy. Empowerment creates conditions for the transformation of people, groups, communities, and the social environment in mutual activities based on self-organization and/or supportive facilitation. A characteristic feature of empowerment is the non-linearity, dynamism, multilevel integration of macro-social, meso-social, micro-social, and intrapersonal factors and processes. The levels of individual, group, community, organizational, and institutional empowerment are distinguished. In this paper, we propose the beginning of a discussion about the empowerment approach as a way to study and overcome social problems in mutual activities of people, groups and communities as actors, and transforming agents.

AB The article attempts to analyze the main directions and specifics of economic activities of the South Ural service Mishars (meshchelyaks) in the 17th - 19th centuries, who appeared in the region along with other service people aimed at protecting the fortresses of the region. The relevance of the topic is determined both by the practical absence of such works on the Mishars of the southern Urals in Russian and foreign historiography, and by the importance of studying the economy of the service class, which combined military service with economic activities. The authors analyze the relations between military service and economic activities of Mishars, and conditions and opportunities for farming in different periods of the studied time. Attention is paid to the analysis of the problem during the period of the cantonal administration in the region, when the machine of the military-bureaucratic system, brought to a universal state, not only regulated the conditions of military service, but also directly managed the economy of the Misliar class. The authors state that the service Mishars, living in the places of exodus in the middle Volga region and having moved to the southern Urals, remained within the borders of the Volga-Ural historical-ethnographic region, where, for many centuries, there was a close interaction between the peoples of the Middle Volga and Southern Urals. Nevertheless, as a result of the migration of Mishars to another territory, they were waiting for a new socioeconomic reality, a slightly different natural and geographical environment than in the places of exodus, as well as the specifics of the existing ethnic environment, which led to the formation of various options for their economic activities. In the Southern Urals, Mishars, having successfully retained their previous skills, acquired some new features of economic activities that distinguish them from the Mishars living in the Middle Volga region. The academic novelty of the study lies in a comprehensive study of the economic activities of the Mishars of the southern Urals in the period of the 17th - 19th centuries, closely related to their presence in the military service class, interethnic interaction with the living peoples of the region and, above all, their colleagues and neighbors - the indigenous inhabitants of the region - the Bashkirs. At present, the ethnic group of the Mishars of the southern Urals is the least studied ethnic community in the region, although it has been formed on this territory for centuries. The main methodological principle of the research is the principle of historicism, which involves the study of the economic activities of the South Ural military officials as a process of formation and development in close connection with the natural geographical environment, and the dynamics of socio-economic and socio-political relations in the region. The article uses archival and published sources, as well as data from ethnographic research of scientists of the 18th - 21st centuries.

AB As a result of the March 1st uprising, which swept colonial Korea in the spring of 1919, Korean nationalists established the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai. One of the main tasks of the Provisional Government was to achieve international recognition and receive financial assistance for the implementation of antiJapanese resistance. To this end, it tried to establish contacts with the Soviet government, which expressed support for the national liberation movement of Koreans against Japanese imperialism. Based on the documents from the Archive of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and published sources of the Russian Archive of Socio-Political History, the article analyzes diplomatic correspondence between the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea and the government of the RSFSR, and identifies the key stages and problems of bilateral relations in 1920-1922. Initially, the relations between two sides were developing on a friendly basis. The Soviet government was interested in deepening cooperation with all groups of the Korean anti-Japanese resistance. But, as the situation on the Far Eastern Front changed and contradictions between different groups within the Korean left movement in Russia and abroad intensified, the Soviet position towards the Korean nationalists was rethought. However, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was still interested in recognition and financial assistance from the Bolsheviks. The dispatch of two emissaries of the Provisional Government to Russia over only two years testifies to serious contradictions within the national liberation movement, which directly affected the government's image in the international arena. Finally, the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs decided that the power of the Provisional Government was not legitimate and that it could not be fully considered a representative of the Korean people.

AB The article examines Soviet film politics in the context of socio-cultural processes. The ambivalence of the impact of personal-personal, institutional, and geopolitical factors, the "cold war" is shown. The creation of unique films of high artistic value took place against the backdrop of the imagogical and ideological conservation of the Soviet media space. Therefore, in the period under review, there was an escalation of tension in relations between the authorities and the cinematic intelligentsia. This stage became a kind of "autumn marathon" of Soviet cinema politics, associated with the coexistence of counter tendencies - the formal-ritual reproduction of the system and the increasingly manifested ideological and intellectual rejection in order to gain creative and political freedom.

ID NATIONALISM
AB Regionalist movements in post-Soviet Russia have been well studied in relation to ethnic republics, but in the "situation of uncertainty" of the early 1990s, regionalist projects have become widespread in non-ethnic regions as well. It was a clearly expressed as "reactive regionalism". Fearing that in the context of increasing powers of the republics, "Russian" oblasts and krajs would turn out to be "second-rate" regions, regional elites put forward projects aimed at raising their status to the level of republics. Despite the fact that since the second half of the 1990s, regionalism had declined, in some regions, regionalist projects endured. The purpose of the article is to determine how non-ethnic regionalist projects are legitimized and reproduced. Theoretically, their effectiveness is explained by the actor constellation and the extent to which the actors manage to fill them with legitimate meanings. The most favorable constellation is when all three groups of actors are involved in promoting the project: regional authorities ("top-down regionalism"), activists ("bottom-up regionalism"), and intellectuals. Therefore, for an in-depth study, those regionalist projects, where a favorable actor constellation formed after the middle of 1990s, have been selected: The Baltic republic in the Kaliningrad oblast', The Ural republic in the Sverdlovsk oblast', and the Pomor republic in the Arkhangelsk oblast'. As the constellation changed over time, a comparative analysis of these projects in dynamics makes it possible to answer the research question. Our findings reveal that a favorable actor constellation is not a decisive factor for a project to gain public support. More important is the effective legitimation of the project. In the Arkhangelsk oblast', where actor constellation was the most favorable, the "ethnicization" of the regionalist idea did not meet wide public support, while the population of the Kaliningrad oblast', on the contrary, continued to have a positive attitude to the regionalist idea even in the 2000s, when the authorities had stopped promoting it.

AB The article examines the "American discourse" in Dostoevsky's fiction and journalism. Dostoevsky is known as one of the founders of the "Russian idea" concept, a writer who advocated the preservation of national values in the face of possible Western interventions. Alongside the West, he saw America as the most important opponent of Russian identity. If Dostoevsky's development of the idea of " native soil" functioned as a third node beyond the Slavophile-Westernizer binary, so too did America complicate the narrative of Russia vs the West. If Russia and Europe shared a common past-Dostoevsky's contemporaries had all been raised on the culture and philosophy of Europe, and many had even been educated there-Russia and America had no such shared past. Russian intellectuals and writers of the period all agreed that America was not Europe, and it was not the West. America was a new concept coming into philosophical being, a concept which would capture the literary and philosophical imagination of Dostoevsky and his contemporaries, like Nikolai Chernyshevsky. The American discourse begins with references to the name of Columbus, vividly described in the idea of fleeing or threatening flight (begstvo meaning both escape and the act of flight); it becomes synonymous with death and the mythologem of hell in Dostoevsky's literary texts. At the same time, America becomes a metaphor for the manifestation of a suffering consciousness, whose phenomenological analysis is connected in Dostoevsky's discourse with the image of the "rootless intelligentsia," the consciousness-disease of the underground man. Leaving such a person in a state of submerged consciousness, "bracketing" all the external circumstances of his life, Dostoevsky shows his doom in the search for the universal meaning of life. The room of America, where he places some of his sufferers, makes this hopelessness evident (figurative) and obvious, from the writer's point of view.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of information content of regional materials on the religious landscape of the Tyumen region. The article is based on documents from the fund of state security agencies deposited in the state archive of the socio-political history of the Tyumen region. Researchers can work with documents dated earlier than 1964. The materials describe a variety of methods of working with different faiths. In addition, the available data contain statistical information and socio-demographic characteristics of believers. Descriptions of religious practices and religious everyday life have been preserved. It is concluded that the materials of the regional state security agencies are an important source in the context of a lack of information about the religious situation in the Soviet provinces in the post-war USSR.

   historiography
AB A radical and reformist discourse on the nature and limits of the "folk element" in the British political system in the first third of the 19th century is considered. The key features of this discourse and the role it played in shaping a broad Tory identity are studied. It is shown that during the period under study, the focus of political controversy shifted from issues of sovereignty and royal prerogative to issues related to fair popular representation and the nature of the necessary political reforms. The novelty of the study lies in the emphasis on the fact that it was the abuse of power by the "popular element" in the British constitutional system that was the main threat to sustainable development. This thesis is supported by documentary evidence, including those first introduced into scientific circulation. It is emphasized that the broad Tory identity that developed during the period under study was based on adherence to the ideals of the constitutional order, established as a result of the Glorious Revolution. The author's assessment of how the various approaches of the Tory groups to the issue of reform eroded the broad identity of the Tories, creating a basis for the formation of political ideas of conservatism, is presented.

The authors briefly analyze the background of the crisis, including a number of features of the previous Taliban regime that governed the country from 1996 to 2001. The authors emphasize the fact that the Afghan crisis is deep, large-scale and protracted, that it is fraught with all sorts of exacerbations, including those with the most negative consequences for the countries of Central Asia, in whose security and stability the Russian Federation is vitally interested.

DT Article
DE cognitive code; discourse of madness; new discourse; social customer;
   battle for minds
AB The article focuses on the 'cognitive revolution' of the New Age, when the Catholic ontology was replaced by the completely opposite Protestant one. Among other changes, the concept of rationality changed, and along with it the semantic and pragmatic content of culture and economics. The author analyzes a number of historical turning points, revealing the occurred transformations of the institutional architecture, as well as the new role of economic institutions represented primarily by financiers. In particular, the author reveals the close dependence between the process of delegitimization of the Catholic Church and the inflation processes that came to Europe with the American gold, and analyses the connection between the struggle of the owners of 'new money' for the legitimization of their new social quality and the emergence of Protestantism. The ontological metaphors of Catholicism and Protestantism are also presented: they set the goals and imperatives of the development of political systems, and along with them - the criteria of social mobility and increase in social status. Thus, in the Catholic ontology, the main social subject that determines how an excess resource is invested is de facto society, while in the Protestant one it is the individual. Among other things, it sets the limits of economic expansion, as well as the meanings of cultural and cognitive production: in the second case, the latter concentrates on the task of acquiring individual material well-being, which, in accordance with the Protestant paradigm, is a pass to the Heavenly City. The transition to a new paradigm turned out to be critical for the natural sciences, it allowed them to emerge, but for the social sciences, it was not so fruitful. The problem is that at a certain stage the 'natural' metaphor, successful for natural sciences, was extrapolated to social reality, turning the latter to an object of regulation rather than the object of cognition. Relying on the theory of cycles of capitalism by Giovanni Arrighi, the author also highlights an actor that had an interest in the changes that occured a class of Genoese bankers. As a result of the Columbian discoveries, they acquired a powerful financial resource, and turned it into a powerful tool for transforming the political design of Western political systems.

AB Introduction. The article examines some of key words used by Russia's opposing political forces in 1917. Method. Using methodological tools of the Cambridge Cambridge school of intellectual history the authors study the meaning of words "Kornilovites", "Kornilovism" and "Kerenshchina". The authors study the different contexts of political statements and of political usage of these words. Analysis. The rhetorical design of the conflicts that preceded the Kornilov affair influenced the course of this political crisis: people of different views assumed that the crisis is inevitable, and it would take the form of a violent confrontation. Some people even believed that this crisis would develop into a civil war. Results. The Kornilov affair was perceived as an outbreak of a the civil war, it changed the discursive situation: for some actors the words "Kornilovites", "Kornilovism" became a tool for describing political enemies, and all compromises with them were excluded, while for others these words were a sign of forming of their own political identity. In such situation, the positions of supporters of political compromises were weakened, while different scenarios for the political solutions by force acquired many new supporters both "from the left" and "from the right". Such descriptions and self-descriptions of political opponents justified the use of violence, and it contributed to the country's slide into the full-scale civil war.

DE truth; demons; Christ; the inner world of man; the external world of man
AB The paper is devoted to clarifying the sense and meaning of a paradoxical statement of F.M. Dostoevsky, who said that he would prefer "to stay with Christ rather than truth". He expressed this idea in 1854 in a letter to N.D. Fonvizina. This idea was reproduced in his "Demons" novel, in a dialogue between Shatov and Stavrogin. In the novel, truth epitomizes science, the external world of the human being, whereas Christ represents the world of his/her internal life. And every person realizes his/her choice between the values of these worlds. Characterizing this choice, the author of the paper turns to the work "The Will to Believe" by William James, according to whom, a choice is true when it "belongs to the category of living, necessary and important", that is, when it contributes to achieving harmony in the person's life. The problem of harmony turns out to be central in the human being's life as in the choice between truth and Christ. Setting off science against religion by the characters of "Demons" leads to disharmony of their life, to social conflicts. The way of their resolution in the XIX century was seen by many, including Slavophils, "in the requirement of larger rapprochement of religion with the lives of people and nations" (I.V. Kireevsky). Indeed, the harmony of the external and internal worlds of the believer's life is possible if we understand the external world as the "Kingdom of God", which "is within" the person (Luke 17: 20-21). But the values of the inner world of the person are opposed by natural goods, without which the person cannot live, and most often they were the source of conflicts. Therefore, Stavrogin's assertion that "the goal of the entire popular movement... is exclusively the search for God..." is untenable. In the absence of God, demons can take His place in the inner world of the person. And only the involvement with a "Great Thought", according to Stepan Verkhovensky, will save the person from demons, whereas the achievement of harmony in both worlds of human life will rescue Russia from social disturbances. This seems to be the real meaning of the "Demons" novel. In the information age, the extemal world overshadows the world of human inner life, and it is our task to take this threat into account.

AB For the first time on the basis of archival materials, the article examines the issue of attracting Kalmyks to active military service in the 1920s as part of the Red Army units. From the middle of the 17th and almost to the end of the 18th century. Kalmyks participated in all the wars of Russia in their national military units as part of the Russian army, then - in the Patriotic War of 1812, the Civil War of 1918-1920. Therefore, with the creation of the Red Army on the basis of compulsory military service of citizens of Soviet Russia, difficulties arose with the recruitment of Kalmyks for military service due to low literacy and the language barrier, although their fighting qualities were not in doubt. The problems of conscription of Kalmyks for active military service were solved during the reform of the Red Army in the 1920s, which coincided with the economic, socio-political, cultural development of the Kalmyk Autonomous Region.

DE nature of war; methodology; political science; strategic culture;
   Austria; Russia; Germany
AB The collective monograph "Military sciences versus the science of war" edited by V.K. Belozerov and A. Dubowy presents the results of a discussion of experts from Russia, Austria and Germany focused on the methodological problems of war studies. The discussions brought together specialists with profound research, educational, and military experience who contributed to a interdisciplinary dialogue between representatives of two schools of modern military thought. The authors of the monograph strive to discover a set of methodological principles that would give a holistic/systemic vision of war based on an understanding of the deep relations between its military, political, economic, and social aspects. The evolution of different sciences that study war at various levels and dimensions has objectively approached a new stage of research associated with the integration of knowledge about war on an interdisciplinary basis. An integrated science of war should also help to create a model of governance that harmoniously combines the civil and military spheres. In the field of military education, this implies the expansion of the military horizons of the officer corps through academic knowledge. Both Russian and Austro-German strategic traditions have close scientific and philosophical roots, dating back to the teachings of K. Clausewitz. At the same time, the originality of Russian political thought manifests itself in the fact that it anticipated many features of modern wars. The authors from Russia and Austria emphasize that Clausewitz's critics underestimate the differences between the essence and phenomenon of war. As result they make a false conclusion about the obsolescence of his theory. The monograph offers various options for a systematic study of war, taking into account the social nature of war, whether it is "military political science", "polemology", or another discipline.

The topic of the article is relevant, since the memory of the Civil War of 1936-1939 is an important factor of political processes in modern Spain, including the positioning and discourse of political parties. Methods and materials. The purpose of the article is to determine the semantic dominants of the construction of the memory policy by the political parties of Spain in 2007-2021. The research is carried out on the basis of social constructivism, the concepts of historical memory of P. Nora and A. Assman, and discourse analysis. A secondary analysis of the results of sociological surveys was conducted. Analysis and results. The article reveals the political orientation of the "Act on Historical Memory" of 2007 and the proposals of political parties on its reform. It is proved that the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers' Party is interested in reviewing the policy of memory, deepening its anti-Francoist content. The left-wing parties - "Unidas Podemos" and "Mas Pais", as well as the Catalan parties, most radically advocate the adoption of a new law on historical memory, honoring the victims of the war. The center-right forces-the People's Party and "Ciudadanos" ("Citizens") to limit the effect of the 2007 Act, portraying the parties to the conflict - Republicans and nationalists - as equally responsible for the violence. The right-wing radical party "Vox" openly considers itself the successor of Francoism and its unitarian program, placing all the blame on the Republicans. The activity of parties of Catalonia and the Basque Country in the field of constructing historical memory is evaluated, the trends of contrasting the memory of the Civil War in public opinion throughout Spain, as well as Catalonia and the Basque Country are shown. Conclusion. In general, the policy of remembering the Civil War for 2018-2021 has become much more important for public opinion, which is explained by the current political competition.

In the proposed article the author, for the first time, consistently and comprehensively has traced the evolution of Adolf Hitler's strategy towards the conquest of the oil fields in the Caucasus as part of the Nazi German government's plan for world domination. The lower chronological border (1940) is defined by the year when the first military plans of Nazi German's leadership for capture of oil reserves in the Caucasus were developed. The upper chronological border is defined by the end of the military operations in the city of Stalingrad and in the Caucasus, which put an end to the "global ideas" of the Nazi German command Methods and materials. The methodology of the research is based on the application of both traditional methods of historical and economic sciences (comparative, statistical, problem-chronological) and new approaches (factor analysis, elements of behaviorist method, involving analysis of the actions of actors, procedures for making certain decisions depending on their value priorities, character traits). The author of the article utilized an interdisciplinary approach towards their research, given that it helped to achieve the goal of the study. The conclusions are based on the documents of the national archives, memoirs of military leaders, statistical information, etc. In the course of the work the authors collected and analyzed a significant amount of archival material, examined domestic and foreign historiography on the subject.

DT Article
DE metropolitan Spyridon-Sava; old Russian Homily for the Nativity of Our
   Lord Jesus Christ; 16(th) century; contextual links; Menaion Homiliary
AB This article considers the previously unstudied Homily for the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ found in the manuscript of the early sixteenth century from the Kornilievo-Komelsky Monastery. Based on a comparison with other works attributed to Spyridon-Sava and considering the typical features of his works, i. e. his teleology and Graecisms, the author puts forward a hypothesis that the Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Russia is the author of the Homily. The material used by the author to substantiate his attribution is withdrawn from the title of the Homily for the Descent of the Holy Spirit which is stylistically akin to the homily found. The plot comparison of the Homily for the Nativity makes it possible to single out a common motif that unambiguously connects this homily with the Message about the Monomachus' Crown, whose belonging to Spyridon has been questioned. After summarising all known information about Spyridon, the author puts forward a concept that determines his participation in political contacts between Muscovite Russia, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Referring to the chronicle entries, the author suggests revising the relationship between Spyridon and Ivan III, whose patronage can explain the high assessment of Spyridon's activities by Archbishop Gennady, Abbot Dositheus, and Maksim Grek. The author revises Spyridon's message about his "imprisonment" in the Ferapontov Monastery, suggesting that the condemnation of Spyridon and his "curse" in the charters issued may have been caused by a change in the political situation at the end or after the reign of Ivan III.

AB The key research task addressed in this article is to identify, using the example of Tajikistan, the main methods of struggle for influence currently used by leading international actors. Tajikistan is considered both as an autonomous actor with significant internal sources of development, and as an object of influence from more powerful states. The article analyses the nature of the actions taken by the United States, China, and Russia to gain political, economic, and cultural influence in this Central Asian republic. These states act as investors and trade partners in Tajikistan, they gain influence in education by promoting the study of English, Chinese and Russian languages. While the Western investments tend to decrease, the United States retains its influence, primarily in the financial sector. It also attracts the most active, young, educated citizens of Tajikistan to US for permanent residence. Of all countries, China has the most consistent and effective investment strategy, which includes the allocation of investment loans to Tajikistan, the creation of infrastructure facilities through these loans by Chinese companies and labor. The gradual establishment of China's dominance in the economic sphere is accompanied by an increase in China's presence in education and culture. Russia is Tajikistan's main trading partner, the most important security provider, and destination for a critical number of labor migrants. There is a fundamental difference in the approaches of Russia, China, and the United States to Tajikistan: the activities of Russia and China are focused on maintaining and strengthening stability in Tajikistan, the United States, in the context of their campaign of tough confrontation with Russia, is ready to assist in destabilizing the situation in Tajikistan, using Islamists for this purpose.

DE object-oriented anthropology; improvement; biotechnology;
   self-identification; self-removal; body orientation; existence
AB In connection with the development and ubiquity of digital technologies, numerous developments in the field of biomedical human improvement, the introduction of biotechnologies and informatization, the problem of distinguishing the human from the non-human is coming to the fore, the line between them is rapidly thinning. In the light of all technological advances, we are assimilating new terminology imperceptibly, gradually, together with a new style of thinking about a person. One of the directions of such assimilation and shift of emphasis in the understanding of the specifically human is the biotechnological approach to humans. The origins and consequences of the approach are convincingly discussed in works by P.D. Tishchenko, who was the first to notice the tendency of "destruction of the human in a human", characteristic of this approach. The biotechnological approach can be accepted or rejected, but it will not be possible to ignore it today, since it is not even that a new field of research has appeared along with a new terminology, but that a new existential experience has appeared that requires appropriate reflection. Moreover, in the situation with bioethical problems, we deal not only with new experience in terms of experimental data about a person and not just with terminology, but also with the development of a special type of representation of a person, which is characterized in the presented article as "object-oriented anthropology" (by analogy with Graham Harman's object-oriented ontology). The author of the article identifies two basic concepts for the biotechnological approach to a person that form the understanding of a person in the bioethical paradigm: "here" and "it's about to come". Analyzing both the understanding of the concept " here" and the attitude to the body in works by R. Descartes, M. Heidegger, J.-P. Sartre, M. Foucault, M. Merleau-Ponty, as well as modern research in the field of bioethics by B.G. Yudin, O.V. Popova, P.D. Tishchenko, S.Yu. Shevchenko, S.V. Lavrentieva, the author of the article comes to the conclusion that a person as " here" in modern bioethical discourse is completely objectified and is actually inhuman or "Dasein" (using Heidegger's terminology) way of being, while " it's about to come" loses its remoteness and gets as close as possible to " here", thereby supporting the initial understanding of a person as a thing, as an object for manipulation. The danger of any improvement and manipulation of the human in a human, associated with a technological, body-oriented and object-oriented understanding of a person, is that, thanks to the paradigms "here" and "it's about to come" that merge in the biotechnological approach to a human, with the general tendency of body orientation and inattention to the fact that a person cannot be understood as "cash" equated to a class of objects without losing their own essence, this leads to the inevitable appearance of the topic of "subhuman", also characteristic of bioethical research. The " person" as "here" or as "it's about here" becomes a "contractual" person. Thus, in search for the improvement of a human and the expansion of the horizons of human existence, object-oriented anthropology brings a person into the sphere of the inhuman and turns out to be not a way of one's own rediscovery and affirmation, but another way to abandon oneself and avoid the human in a human.

DT Article
DE metaphor; semantics; pragmatics; meaning; Aristotle
AB The article explores the semantics-pragmatics relations concerning metaphor interpretation in natural languages. We deal with the historical roots of metaphor founded in Aristotle, who emphasized that metaphor interpretation requires theknowledge of the external world. We present two formal semantics approaches to metaphor developed by Joseph Stern and Emma Borg. They both claim that successful metaphor interpretation needs the knowledge of extra-linguistic factors to supplement semantic knowledge. In conclusion, we define which of these two approaches is more consistent with Aristotle's view. The first part of the article is concerned with Stern's approach. He suggests a theory of metaphor developed in accordance with Kaplan's semantics, where we distinguish two levels of meaning, i. e. the character of the expression and the presupposing of the character - content distinction. The formal semantic theory of metaphor aims to define the rules for meaning assignment for metaphoric utterances. However, these formal rules only provide a universal form of interpretation for metaphoric utterances and do not explain the actual process of interpretation. In order to explain this process, we need to supplement semantics with pragmatic knowledge. The second part of the article deals with Borg's approach, which also presupposes that semantics is not enough to understand metaphor. In addition to semantic knowledge, one requires psychological knowledge, i. e. the knowledge of the structural relationships between concepts that reflect the structural relationships in the external world. Having psychological knowledge is what allows us to interpret metaphorical utterances. We argue that the main similarity between the two presented approaches lies in the fact that they both admit that having semantic knowledge is not enough for a successful interpretation of metaphor. The difference between the approaches is that Stern states that we need to add pragmatic knowledge, while Borg argues that we need the psychological one. We agree that Aristotle accepts isomorphism between language, thought, and the external world. Based on the fact that Borg implicitly accepts the weaker version of isomorphism, i. e. between thought and the external world, and Stern does not, we conclude that Borg's approach is more consistent with Aristotle's view.

AB The development of political economy in the Russian Empire not only reflected all the inconsistency of the process of its formation, evolution and theoretical and methodological restructuring in the West, but also differed significantly from it. The latter was due to the difference in the conditions in which this process took place, the range of specific problems with the solution of which it was associated with the general level of development of scientific economic ideas and the like. N. Bunge says that political economy as a science could be formed in Europe only on the basis of the development of market relations, the growth of personal independence, civil freedom and private property. In Russia there were still no conditions even for sufficient mastery of these achievements of Western economic thought.

The relevance of the methods used tomanipulate social axiological attitudes and orientations is due to both the transition of society(institutional, structural, value, behavioral) to the post-industrial, information era, and the end ofdeideologization. The semantic vacuum of the late 20th & mdash; early 21th centuries in many countries ofthe world, it is very actively replaced by the narrativization of history as an effective tool formaintaining the legitimacy of power and constructing identities. The analysis of the memory policyin a theoretical and methodological way revealed the absence of paradigmatic concepts that couldinterpret this phenomenon. At the same time, the topic of memory studies has led to the so & ndash;called & ldquo;third wave & rdquo;, which is characterized, on the one hand, by the semantic differentiation of theproblem field, and on the other hand, by the formation of the actual-applied axis & ldquo;core & mdash;periphery & rdquo;. The applied aspects of the commentary concerning the Russian case are also analyzed.The periodization of the development of the political use of the past is highlighted, which ischaracterized by an explicit strengthening of the influence of historical and memorial politics onpublic groups, which inevitably transforms classical historical science towards posthistory.

DE youth; political parties; generations; leaders
AB In the 2010s-2020s, we can observe a contradiction in Russia: on the one hand, sociologists record the depoliticization of youth; on the other hand, young people are increasingly becoming subjects of the political underground. This alarming trend, called alienation, is a consequence of a lack of a dialogue between youth and parties, which results in a social divide and frustration among young people. In this article, based on the materials of a qualitative sociological study conducted in August-November 2021 on 31 focus groups in 13 subjects of the Russian Federation covering 300 people aged 18 to 25, we elaborate on these issues. According to the results of the study, most of young people identify themselves as liberals, socialists, and conservatives. The groups of both liberals and socialists were dominated by tolerant positions on all acute political issues, which brought them closer together. In contrast, the patriarchal conservatives rejected tolerance and favored traditional values. Instead of a right-/left-wing continuum, we found that attitudes toward minorities are becoming a prevalent split factor among young people and the old ideological scheme is losing its relevance. It would be logical to assume that young people, having decided on their ideological positions, give preference to the corresponding party or leader. However, 90% of young people surveyed said that there are no parties in Russia today that express their interests. A discrepancy arises between the demand of the generation of 20-year-olds and the presented range of Russian politic structures. Today, due to the Internet, young people are genuinely becoming interested in public affairs. In parallel, there is the old world of " youth policy" which was invented by adults for the young. Among the zoomer generation there is a sense of disbelief in the old-style political system. Parliament seems to them a relic of the past when direct democracy was impossible. Zoomers today see how effective social media are: millions of people speak out every day on current issues, they no longer need "representatives" to be heard. Young people are not against the creation of a party capable of expressing their interests, but, in general, another party within the framework of the old idea of representative democracy does not arouse their enthusiasm. They are looking for another opportunity to express an active position, and so far they have not found it. To understand the young is sometimes the shortest way to avoid problems in the future.

DT Article
DE Claude de Seyssel; Georgy Gemist Plifon; Venetian humanism; late
   Byzantine humanism; military estate; monarchy; early Modern times
AB The article deals with the ideas of Claude de Seyssel (1450-1520). Attention is paid to the fact that these ideas were based on an analysis, based on the model proposed by Plato, of the oligarchic form of government as a real form of existence of the republic in contemporary Venice and a study of the applicability of this model to France. The relevance of the work is due to the appearance of a number of works in which one can see that the views of Claude de Seyssel were similar not only to the views of the Italian humanists, but also to the utopian ideas of the reorganization of Byzantium by George Gemistus Plethon (1355/1360-1452/1454). The authors of the article argue that the ideas of Claude de Seyssel should be considered in a broader context than was previously accepted in historical science. It is shown in the article that it was Claude de Seyssel who drew attention to the importance of the military class and its rights as the most important principle for the formation of European monarchies in the context of problems common to Italian and Byzantine humanists. It is proved that he became a kind of transmission link between Italian and Byzantine humanism, on the one hand, and French humanism, on the other, and significantly influenced the development of socio-political and historical concepts of French thinkers of the 16th-17th centuries.

   humanism; existentialism
AB The article analyzes the axiological oppositions (dichotomies) of two German ideologies - state-nationalist and existential-humanistic. The work is aimed at identifying the philosophical and ideological foundations of the history of Germany in the XIX - first half of the )0( centuries. They are connected, first of all, with the struggle of two German ideologies that asserted opposite axiological values. The task is to identify those essential accents of values that inspired some Germans to aggressive and violent activity, and others to rather the opposite activity. The first axiological opposition of ideologies is almost antiChristianity and Christianity. The doubtfulness of Hegel's "Lutheranism" and the spiritual Christianity of Francis of Assisi and Hesse are shown. The second opposition is brutality and humanity. The arguments of Hegel's brutality and rigidity and the humane motives of Hesse's ideology are presented. The third is militarism and anti-militarism. The article shows the assessment of wars by a number of German thinkers, Hegel and the reverse assessment by Hesse. It shows Hesse's struggle to awaken a sense of responsibility among the German people after 1945. The fourth opposition is revolutionism and anti-revolutionism in two ideologies. The fifth is the racism and nationalism of the German thinkers, Hegel and Hesse's anti-racism and internationalism. The sixth dichotomy is the totalitarian spirit and the anti-existentialism of Hegel and humanism, as well as Hesse's existentialism. Hesse defends a person's personal choice, personal path, sometimes even in spite of the state, society, nation. In conclusion, the repeatability of ideologies and historical events is justified. The dichotomies of nationalism and globalism, fanaticism and pragmatism and others are shown; the change of the principles of existence and types of morality in the "spiritless" world.

AB Introduction. Contemporary Russian-U.S. relations have reached freezing point, but expert community continues to analyze possibilities and produce recommendations for the Russian policy of the incoming administration. The study of the debate is important not only for the political and diplomatic purposes but also for better understanding of the mechanisms shaping Russia's image in the United States. Methods and materials. The article provides an analysis of the exchange of expert opinions published in the USA in August - November of 2020, including five open letters published on Politico web site, report of the Atlantic Council and several articles addressing similar themes on the pages of American periodicals. Analysis. Texts of the letters are analyses for their argument and recommendations and compared between each other. The author underlines the difference between the groups of the signatories, depending on their relative experience in working in and on Russia or in the Eastern Europe and suggests correction to the Tsvetan Todorov' approach to the understanding of links between knowledge about and practice towards the "Other". Results. The author notes the existence of the centuries-old legacies of the American approaches to Russia: similar descriptions of Russia persist from the late 19th century to 2020. He also highlights an absence of a Russian position in the debate, while positions of Eastern Europeans and Ukrainians were provided by separate letters.

AB Introduction. The article studies the features of the late Byzantine diplomatic receptions. The author analyses the account of the Burgundian traveller and diplomat Ghillebert de Lannoy, who described diplomatic receptions at various European courts in details. Method. This study applies the methods of imagology and historical anthropology, allowing to identify the foreigner's stable and emotionally-coloured perceptions of another culture. A comparative approach is used to compare the late Byzantine receiving ceremony with receptions by other Christian rulers and the earlier Byzantine diplomatic tradition. Analysis. Ghillebert de Lannoy, as a representative of King Henry V of England, King Charles VI of France, and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy, visited several Eastern European countries. In Constantinople, the embassy met with Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos and his son and co-ruler John VIII and received a hearty welcome. The analysis has uncovered that, in the Palaiologan Age, the imperial reception became less magnificent and more intimate, but sill followed the established Byzantine tradition and differed from receptions at other courts due to its more pronounced ritual nature. The program of the embassy also included purely "Byzantine" entertainments for foreigners: a tour through Constantinople and demonstration of Christian relics. Additionally, imperial gifts excelled among the gifts from other rulers. The Burgundian ambassador was impressed by the official audience following a strict ritual, acquaintance with the city's sights and Christian relics, and gifts he received from the emperor, which possessed high material and spiritual value. Results. The Byzantine diplomatic reception was supposed to convince foreign ambassadors in the political and cultural superiority of the Greeks, to plant in their minds the idea that the Empire, despite its difficult situation, kept a prominent civilizational position in the Christian world. In the case of Ghillebert de Lannoy, these aims were achieved.

AB Sergey Kuzmin's paper draws on Russian and Mongolian archives to discuss the relationship between the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and the Jebtsundamba Khutagtu in the context of their joint hopes for future independence. This was promoted by the prevalence of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia, the leadership of the Tibetan-born Jetsun Dampa Khutuktu, the influential Tibetan colony in the Mongolian capital of Niislel Khuree, and permanent contacts between Mongols and Tibetans. It demonstrates how the two states co-ordinated their independence struggle during the first half of the twentieth century. This association continued after the two states had broken away from China and continued into the 1930s, with individual Tibetan hierarchs becoming involved in local resistance to the Socialist suppression of Buddhism in Mongolia.

AB The article was prepared for the 80th anniversary of the doctor of historical sciences, professor Vladimir Anatolyevich Kitaev. Student of the outstanding soviet historian P.A. Zaionchkovsky, graduate of Gorky State University V.A. Kitaev is an authoritative expert in the field of social movement and public thought in Russia of the 19th century. V.A. Kitaev revealed and convincingly proved that the Russian thought of the 19th century sought answers to topical political and socio-economic issues on the path of ideological synthesis. Conservatism contained elements of liberalism (slavophiles); Russian liberals have not escaped the influence of conservative ideas (K.D. Kavelin, B. N. Chicherin); the journal "Bulletin of Europe" became the ancestor of social liberalism in Russia; one of the leaders of the decembrists, P.I. Pestel, in his constitutional draft attempted to combine liberalism, conservatism, and socialism. The article suggests that such an ideological synthesis could be a reflection of the ideas of the Russian people, which contained the age-old dreams of freedom and the pursuit of it, commitment to traditional national and state values, thirst for social justice. In 1983-1999 V.A. Kitaev worked at Volgograd State University. He was the first dean of the Faculty of History and permanent head of the Department of Russian History. Under his leadership the traditions of the Faculty of History (now the Institute of History, international relations and social technologies) were laid. Now V.A. Kitaev is a professor at Nizhny Novgorod State University.

AB Introduction: enriching vocabulary by creating new words and terms in many languages of the peoples of Russia and the world remains relevant to the present. The lack of scientific, technical, economic, socio-political terminology hinders the full functioning of native languages as state languages in the Finno-Ugric republics of the Russian Federation. Borrowed vocabulary from the Russian language is used in these areas. The compilation of new words concerning many spheres of life and activity of the Mari people, including office work, the introduction into scientific circulation of neologisms of the 1920s-1930s, the "revival" of words that have fallen out of use, the introduction of dialectisms into the vocabulary of the Mari literary language was actively engaged in the widely known in the Finno-Ugric world Doctor of Philological Sciences, Professor I. G. Ivanov. A deep connoisseur of his native language, he always emphasized that the Mari language is not "poor" in terms of vocabulary, as it was customary to think and talk about it. The article is devoted to the analysis of ways and methods of formation of new words in the Mari language on the material of one of its dictionaries.Objective: to identify productive ways of word formation, to trace trends in the enrichment of the lexical fund of the Mari language. Research materials: dictionary "Mutvundym poidarena. U mut-vlak muter" ("Enrich the Vocabulary. Dictionary of New Words") by Professor I. G. Ivanov, research papers devoted to the problem of enriching the vocabulary of the Mari language. Results and novelty of the research: the analysis of new words from the point of view of their ways of formation shows that for the Mari language, derivation and word composition are the most productive. These methods are used in the formation of all independent parts of speech. A new way in word formation proposed by I. G. Ivanov is conversion. It is characteristic for the creation of new nouns. The scientific novelty of the study is that the dictionary was analyzed for the first time in terms of the possibilities of creating new words in the Mari language.

LA English
DT Article
DE philosophy of science; normal science; scientific revolution; paradigm;
   disciplinary matrix; representation; reference; historiography of
   science; epistemology
AB The citation index of Thomas Kuhn's work may strike any imagina-tion. "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" (first edition 1962) is undoubtedly a twentieth-century record-breaker in the field of philosophy of science in terms of such a scientometric parame-ter. But such fame has been bitter in many ways and placed a heavy burden on the author. For several decades he has been the target of the harshest and most severe criticism. Often the concept of "normal science" and the "scientific revolution" as a "Gestalt switch" was declared ridiculous and absurd. The paper analyses three lines of criticism of Kuhn's concept: the first came from practicing scientists, the second from specialists in the phi-losophy of science (primarily proponents of "critical rationalism"), and the third from the field of social epistemology. Reproaches about the political bias of Kuhn's concept were taken to extremes, since his views were widely popular. In our opinion, Kuhn should be called a victim of spontaneous hypercriticism. This circumstance did not allow him to improve the original model of scientific revolutions. In this respect, replacing the concept of "paradigm" with the concept of "disciplinary matrix" was a step backwards, not forwards. However, it is impossible to deny that in the field of the historiography of science, he acted as a real reformer. With the courage of Don Quixote, he de-fended the rights of historical reconstruction, the preservation of the historical past of science, which should not be com-pletely assimilated within the framework of the modern system of knowledge. His motto was - "penetrate the minds of other people who lived in the past." He boldly argued that in the process of historical development, science changes not only ideas about the object of knowledge (representations of the object), but also the reference of its ideas and concepts. Such a for-mulation of the question has not yet been fully reflected in modern epistemological concepts.

LA English
DT Article
DE Sources; Russian revolutionary terrorism; letters to power; terrorist
   activity; revolutionary expropriation
AB The research is devoted to analysis of an original and peculiar source, written appeals of revolutionary terrorists and militants to tsarist authorities and institutions. This type of documents is known in source studies as "letters to power" and has been subject of numerous studies and publications, mostly in form of collective peasants' appeals to authorities at various crisis points in the Russian history of the early 20th century. However, appeals of revolutionary terrorists and militants to population and administration have not yet been subject to analysis and research due to their sparsity, location in local archives, and unwillingness of party committees and police to make them known to general public. Terrorists' appeals to the authorities were essential to terrorism: this was their way to proclaim and make public their demands and reasons for violence. However, party committees always strongly resisted individual militants entering into communication, as they considered terrorist attacks as party activity, were wary of police provocations and concerned about secrecy. Therefore, we can assume that the militants' appeals to the administration are indirect evidence of their autonomy or independence from parties and committees. Such appeals were mostly made in the following two instances: when militants actively participated in action and when they were hiding from police persecution for a long time. Appeals could be verbose or concise, addressed directly to the authorities, or to a certain official, or distributed via media, or left as a note on the crime scene. They mocked police for their incapability to arrest the author, emphasized disinterested or party nature of their combat activity, announced future crimes. Detailed letters often proclaimed that the author had to resort to criminal action due to errors of prior administration. The authors implicitly or explicitly indicated their willingness to end their struggle, if they were to be granted pardon, or if the persecution were to be ceased. Numerous appeals of militants and terrorists to the authorities strongly suggest that social and political crisis of the Russian society was quite deep; they are an important sign of systematically organized party terrorism, as well as a vivid source for studying social and psychological atmosphere in the crisis of the early 20th century in Russia.

ID YABLOS PARADOX
AB This article presents the author's project of a new epistemological concept of analytical realism. The terminological issues related to the choice of the name of the concept are discussed. The main structural elements of analytical realism are outlined. The existing theoretical results are formulated that can be used as the basis of the concept. The main challenges and further prospects for research within the framework of analytical realism in the context of the modern development of epistemology are fixed. The project of a new epistemological concept is proposed to be called "analytical realism". Why "analytical realism"? How justified is this title? For example, if we are based on the research of H. Putnam, then all manifestations of his epistemological program could be called analytical realism, because he always worked within the tradition of English-language analytical philosophy. But at the same time, we know other types of realism both in the topological sense and in the content of these theoretical concepts. For example, the concept of speculative realism which is widely discussed today was born in continental Europe, and in terms of content it has nothing to do with analytical philosophy. One can also consider the problems of realism discussed in the framework of modern philosophy of science. Although this is an English-speaking environment for the most part, the content of this area of research can hardly be attributed to the general context of analytical philosophy either. In this case, the accepted terminological restriction seems to be appropriate. Analytical realism is an epistemological concept developed exclusively in the context of the tradition of analytical philosophy with a focus on logic, philosophy of language, theory of meaning, theory of reference, with a focus on the main representatives of the school of analytical philosophy.

ID UNLABELED GRAPHS
AB Mathematical structuralism is characterized by the acceptance of the thesis that the subject matter of mathematics is structures. These structures can be understood in various ways. Structures, whatever they are, are "implemented" by specific collections of objects. One of the ways to classify different variants of mathematical structuralism relates to the possibility of constructing a theory of structures and how such a theory should be constructed. In other words, this method concerns whether it is possible to describe any mathematical structures using some unified mathematical theory, and what kind of mathematical theory it is. From the point of view of the set-theoretic version of mathematical structuralism, mathematics is the science of structures, which can be described using the apparatus of set theory. Specific mathematical theories "grasp" various kinds of set-theoretic structures, and the relation of realization that takes place between these structures and mathematical theories is supposed to be described by model-theoretic means. This version of structuralism presupposes a non-structural understanding of set theory, and the axioms of structure theory have a fixed interpretation. This version of set theory assumes that the entire universe of sets has already been built, that all stages of the cumulative hierarchy have already been realized, which conflicts with the very idea that every stage in the cumulative hierarchy is followed by the next stage. Another consequence of understanding the axioms of set theory as truths with respect to a fixed structure, as well as the fact that set theory as a basis receives a special status and is not interpreted in a structural way, is that such an approach does not imply any kind of set-theoretic pluralism. That is, only one set-theoretic structure is considered the only correct description of the universe of sets, while any alternative options proceeding from other axioms are discarded as false. In order to get rid of the conflict between the fact that the axioms of the theory of structures assume the universe of sets is already built, and all stages of the cumulative hierarchy of sets are already realized, and the principle of indefinite extendability, one can turn to modalities. Due to the fact that the axioms of set theory are understood in a modal way, it is possible to explain in a potentialist way the totality of all sets without the assumption that there is some universe of sets fixed once and for all. Accordingly, this is consistent with the principle of indefinite extendability. Set-theoretic pluralism still turns out to be significantly limited. That is, modal set-theoretic structuralism still does not provide a structuralist explanation for set theory.

AB The article analyzes the preconditions, causes and consequences of the resumption of hostilities in the zone of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in the fall of 2020. The structure of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the stages of its development in the late XX - early XXI centuries are considered. The paper considers the activities of the OSCE Minsk Group and its efforts for the peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The danger of the existence of unresolved, "frozen" conflicts is conditioned by the potential for a renewed armed confrontation. The reasons for the resumption of hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh are analyzed at three levels in accordance from a neorealist perspective. At the level of interpersonal relations, the regress in mutual understanding between the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, which has manifested itself in recent years, is analysed. Their careers and political experience are compared. At the level of analysis of interstate relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, a comparative characteristic of the potential of these states is presented. From the very beginning the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh was asymmetric but a gradual change in the balance of military power in favor of the Azerbaijani side is perceptible. When analyzing the internal political processes, attention is drawn to a weakening of state institutions in Armenia after the events of 2018. At all stages of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the influence of nationalism on the mass consciousness of the population of Armenia and Azerbaijan remained, which impacted the policies of both parties involved in the conflict. Analyzing the processes taking place at the level of the system of international relations, the author notes the growing activity of Turkey, striving for leadership and hegemony in the region. There is a significant increase in the level of political and military support to Azerbaijan from this country. The article emphasizes the role of the Russian Federation as an effective mediator that managed to broker an agreement between the two sides to end the armed struggle in Nagorno-Karabakh. The deal reached on November 9, 2020 is analysed as well as the consequences for Russia's foreign policy of "unfreezing" the conflict.

AB The author focuses on the little-known Siberian period in the life of Vladimir N. Lvov (1872 - 1930) the former member of the III and IV State Dumas of Russia, the Chief Procurator of the Most Holy Synod (March July 1917). The article is mostly based on the records of the archive of the Federal Security Service Directorate of the Russian Federation in Tomsk region and the materials of newspapers, published during the Russian Civil War. V.N. Lvov left revolutionary Petrograd and ran to the Volga region from where he was later evacuated because of the war. Like other refugees, the Lvov family headed to the East and temporarily settled in Tomsk. There began the first period of V.N. Lvov's life in Siberia (autumn 1918 - December 1919). The author refers to the facts from his interviews and public speeches in Tomsk, and those published in Omskbrochures where Lvov reminisced on the events that happened in Petrograd in 1917. The defeat of the White Army forced Lvov to leave Tomsk and move abroad. In Paris he joined the immigrant movement, that advocated the acknowledgement of the Soviet government in Russia. In 1922 he returned to the Soviet republic and joined the Renovationists movement that was used by the Bolsheviks to destroy the Russian Orthodox Church. The second Siberian period in the life of V.N. Lvov (1927-1930) began when he was arrested by the Joint State Political Department in Moscow and sent to Tomsk into the three-year exile. There, he taught foreign languages, but he lost his job in 1929 and dragged on a miserable existence. In February 1930, he was arrested by the Joint State Political Department (OGPU) of the Tomsk Region and accused of the counter-revolutionary actions within "an anti-Soviet group". He was under arrest for seven months waiting for the sentence. After the Plenipotent Office of the Joint State Political Department in the Western-Siberian Kraihad found out that Tomsk chekists (secret service agents) falsified political cases, some of them (including the case of V.N. Lvov) were reopened. All of the accused were acquitted by the resolution of the Plenipotent Office of OGPU in the Western-Siberian Krai and set free. But a few days earlier, on September 20, 1930, V.N. Lvov died in the hospital ward of the Special purpose detention center in Tomsk. He was buried on the Voznesensky cemetery that was destroyed later. All in all, Lvov had to spend five years in Siberia. But he was not engaged in any kind of political or social activity when he was there as a refugee during the Russian Civil War or in his administrative exile under the Soviet rule.

DE "New Silk Road"; world-system analysis; modern world-system; public
   consciousness; foreign policy goals; Russian nationalism
AB Continuing the discussion on the sociological aspects of Russia's participation in the creation of the trans-Eurasian high-speed transport corridor, the author suggests considering the worldsystem analysis as the main element of the "sociology of space". We are talking about the identification of three groups of countries - the core, the semi-periphery and the periphery - according to the criterion of their participation in the formation of international "rules of the game". From this point of view, the " New Silk Road" is an element of global domination by new leaders (semi-peripheral BRICS countries) the old ones (first of all, the USA). Empirical data from surveys of Russians organized in the 2000s-2020s. According to the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the focus of the Russian political leadership on increasing its international role is based on the public consciousness of Russians, more than 80% of whom want their country to become at least one of the most economically developed and politically influential. Opinion polls also show that, despite the confrontation with the West in recent years, Russians still have a high level (slightly less than half of citizens) of awareness of Russia as a European country, which might become an important element of approving the "big project" of a transport corridor connecting China and the EU. At the same time, the high prevalence of Russian nationalism (the idea of Russia as a "common home" is shared by only about half of Russians) may become a factor complicating the implementation of this important international project.

AB Introduction. The Civil War in the United States (1861-1865) has been of considerable interest to historians, lawyers, economists, and political scientists for more than 150 years. The internal political struggle that broke out in the middle of the 19th century between the two regions of the young democratic state seems to be a valuable object of research. However, scientific approaches to the study of the causes of the "inevitable conflict", their transformation and rebirth depending on the historical period and the political situation are of even greater interest. This article attempts to summarize the main trends in the historiography of the causes of the Civil War in the United States, mainly in foreign historiography. Methods of research and materials. The methodological basis of the study was made up of general scientific and private scientific methods. The historical-legal, comparative method, as well as sociological, concrete-historical and systemic methods are used. The theoretical basis of the study was the work of mainly foreign historians, lawyers, political scientists and state historians. Analysis. Without denying the centrality of slavery among the causes of the Civil War, researchers identify religious, economic, political and social factors as the key determinants of the separatist movement in the South. A special place in American studies is occupied by the consideration of the role of African Americans in inciting conflict, the personality factor of A. Lincoln, as well as the influence of the abolitionist movement and journalists on the growing confrontation between the North and the South. At the same time, all directions, one way or another, boil down to the fact that it was slavery that was the fundamental cause of the Civil War. The peculiarities of the formation of each of the scientific directions were determined by the socio-economic and political conditions that took place in a particular historical period. Results. The periodization of scientific approaches to the study of the causes of the Civil War in the United States in the historical and legal literature can be carried out by dividing the research into three main periods: the "confrontational" (second half of the 19th century); the "socio-economic" (beginning - middle of the 20th century); the "industrial" (middle of the 20th century - the beginning of the 21st century). In the period from the beginning of the 21st century to the present, there is an obvious consensus on the central role of slavery among the determinants of war, but approaches to this problem in recent years have been characterized by interdisciplinarity, complexity, taking into account completely different sides of the conflict. Each of these areas has contributed to the formation of a holistic view of the causes of the Civil War, allowing us to realize the complex, multifaceted nature of the causes of the conflict and to reject two-dimensional approaches to their understanding.

DE syllogistics; intensional semantics; conservative extension; Leibniz;

AB The article considers a new approach to the construction of semantics for syllogistic statements - an intensional one, in which general terms are compared not with the extensions of concepts (as it has been since the time of Aristotle), but with sets of attributes (that is, the content of concepts), and syllogistic constants are considered not as relations of inclusion of classes of extensions of concepts, but as signs of relations between concepts according to their content. This approach to the interpretation of syllogistics goes back to the logical works of Leibniz, which are analyzed in the article. The semantics formalizing the Leibniz approach proposed by Vladimir Markin is presented. Special attention is paid to the description of a special type of construction of Nikolay Vasiliev's imaginary logic, the interpretation of imaginary logic based on the intensional interpretation of attributive statements with two types of negations (strict or absolute and weak) is considered. The formalization of this variant of imaginary logic proposed by Dmitry Zaitsev and Vladimir Markin is given. The article presents calculus corresponding to two intensional semantics: for traditional syllogistics C4 ( Lukasiewicz syllogistics) and for imaginary logic-2 by Vasiliev (IL2). The main result of the article is the conclusion that the IL2 system with two types of negations is a conservative extension of the C4 system. To demonstrate this, a sublanguage (containing only those syllogistic constants contained in C4) is allocated in the richer IL2 system, with the help of which the axioms of traditional syllogistics are set, the identity of the construction of the semantics of the two systems is shown. The corresponding theorems are formulated and proved: the theorem that the IL2 calculus is an extension of the C4* calculus (this is the C4 calculus given through a sublanguage); a theorem on the semantic equivalence of two systems; a theorem on conservative extension (Vladimir Smirnov's definitions are used for proofs).

AB The purpose of the AUKUS strategic alliance is to develop cooperation between the member countries (Australia, the UK, and the U.S.) in the field of security and defence in the Indo-Pacific region.The agreement provides for the supply of submarines powered by nuclear reactors to Australia. The emergence of this new strategic alliance was caused by the following factors: the increased power of China in the region, the weakening of the U.S. position in the Indo-Pacific, the desire of the UK to implement the "global Britain" strategy in practice, and the need for the U.S. to have reliable allies to contain China. These factors reveal the true purpose of AUKUS-containment of China and opposition to its active policy in the region.In this article, the author uses comparative analysis to reveal the different goals and geopolitical interests of the AUKUS countries. The systematic approach helps to describe the essence of the complex geopolitical system developing in the Indo-Pacific region. The theories of new institutionalism and constructivism make it possible to identify both continuity and gaps in the security policy and foreign policy of regional actors. Australia's participation in AUKUS allows it to strengthen its political ties with influential partners-the United States and Great Britain, receive additional security guarantees from them in the context of increased activity of Chinese policy in the region, raise the country's status in the regional hierarchy, and strengthen its defence capability.Australia's entry into AUKUS means the formation of a new, anti-Chinese strategy in the region. For the UK, membership in AUKUS allows it to expand its naval presence in the Indo-Pacific region, strengthen its special relations with the United States, improve its image (which was shaken after the country's exit from the European Union), and restore traditional ties with Australia. For the United States, AUKUS is the implementation of the strategy of pivot to Asia and the creation of a new alliance that has greater opportunities for military-strategic cooperation in the face of the threat from China to use the Pacific Ocean to oust the United States from a leading position. There are some potential regional geopolitical consequences of AUKUS. They include escalation of tension and the nuclear arms race of the opposing parties, a new cold war with China, expansion of the club of nuclear powers because of Australia, imbalance of geopolitical forces in the region, the undermining of transatlantic unity, and the emergence of a common strategy in the foreign policy of European countries and the United States.

DE Seno Giro; Shinko Bukkyo Seinen Domei; Buddhism; socialism; monotheism;
   creationism
AB This article discusses the philosophical views of Seno Giro (1890-1961), the founder of the movement "Shinko Bukkyo Seinen Domei" ("Youth League of the Revival of Buddhism"). The study shows that Seno Giro sought to develop his own original philosophy, combining a complex of Buddhist doctrines and the main aspects of socialism, which was popular in the liberal Japanese circles at that time. The paper analyzes the main trends of his movement, which was focused on the reformation of traditional Buddhist institutions and the creation of a Buddhism that would be more suitable for the requirements of the modern era. The evolution of Seno Giro's views is traced from a simple adherence to the dogmas of Nitirenism to the idea that Buddhism, if it were reorganized on the basis of the ideas of Western philosophy, could be a solution to the social problems caused by capitalism. Thus, it is concluded that Seno Giro not only called for a complete reformation of Japanese Buddhism (as many Japanese intellectuals of that time did), but also sought its practical implementation, considering the synthesis of socialism and Buddhism as the most appropriate option. According to Seno Giro, the study of the political philosophy of socialism would help to awaken Buddhists from their "dogmatic sleep", and Buddhism, in turn, would complement socialist atheism and materialism with humanistic ethics, due to the fact that it lacks the monotheism and creationism inherent in Christianity.

AB Formation of administrative system in the Kalmyk steppe in the first quarter of the 19th century led to emergence in that inorodtsy environment of a professional group of officials characterized by diverse class composition, various levels of education and confessional affiliation, which was radically different from autochthonous population leading a nomadic life and professing quite different religious views. Despite abundant historiography on the problem of bureaucracy in the Russian Empire, this professional group serving in the inorodtsy directorates remained out of researchers' eye. However, it represents the social capital of the region, thus explaining the interest in the issue. The research assesses everyday life of the ulus administration officials who lived on the territory of the Kalmyk steppe in the second half of the 19th - early 20th century highlighting three areas: image of home and home comfort; intra-family relations; and infrastructure. It draws on documentary materials from the fonds of the National Archive of the Republic of Kalmykia containing personal data of civil servants and paperwork. The socio-demographic picture of the professional group in question was obtained through analysis of service lists and certificates. Integrated use of reconstruction methods and content analysis of documentary materials, as well as descriptions compiled by researchers, permits to reconstruct the appearance of the ulus stavka, administrative center where the officials lived; interior of the trustee's house and to assess his welfare and intra-family communications. The author concludes that everyday life of the ulus officials depended not only on their official position, level of education, financial solvency, and mindset, but also on such factors as natural and climatic conditions, autochthonous population's economic management, and incorporation of the territory in the national socio-economic and political-legal space. Isolation from familiar environment and established communication ties and lack of accessible infrastructure predetermined changing role of women in this micro society, which was formed on the principle of service.

AB The article is dedicated to the memory of Pyotr Fedorovich Nikulin, professor of the Faculty of Historical and Political Sciences of Tomsk State University (August 10, 1951, - January 31, 2022). Pyotr Fedorovich's life path is an example of becoming a scientist from a village boy to a professor at one of the leading universities in Russia. He was able, although not completely, to realize his creative potential - a gift from God due to the diligence and perseverance laid down by his parents, Old Believers peasants. His scientific works are a tribute to the memory of the main estate of Russia - the peasantry, who went down in history and created a modern industrial and intellectual country with their labors and destinies. He was engaged in the most difficult part of historical science - source studies, the search for optimal methods of analyzing mass sources - agricultural censuses to determine the level and prospects of development of farms of Siberian peasants. He was not only a student of professors of the Faculty of History of Tomsk University, but also a graduate student of academician, Professor of Moscow State University I.D. Kovalchenko. The main conclusion from the works of P.F. Nikulin the fact that the farms of Siberian peasants were almost 100% natural, regardless of its scale, is confirmed by calculations. According to P.F. Nikulin, the main way of modernization of the peasant world was cooperation, not farming.
   The authors believe that Pyotr Fyodorovich Nikulin left a noticeable mark in the historical Siberian literature.

DE Mongolian civilization; national identity; foreign policy; multipolar

AB The article is devoted to the problem of positioning Mongolia in the modern world. The research is based on a civilizational approach to understanding the Mongolian world and political realism. To determine the characteristics of the Mongolian civilization, the authors study philosophical thoughts and ideas about harmony, duality, specific understanding of time, and Buddhism - all those ideas that influenced the views of the Mongols on "nations", history and geopolitics. From the point of view of political realism, the position of Mongolia is quite vulnerable. Mongolia currently has a difficult choice of foreign policy strategy. As a possible response to the growing threat of a potential conflict between the three main centers of world development - the United States, China and Russia, the authors consider the deepening of Mongolia's cooperation with its closest neighbors Russia and China in a trilateral format. In this case, the role of Mongolia would increase sharply to the level of an equal subject of international relations, since the country appears as the core of the Mongolian world and a separate local civilization of Inner Asia. Mongolia willingly engages in new forms of cooperation, being an observer of the SCO, and even expressing its intention to join the EAEU in the future. At the same time, in the choice of Mongolia's foreign policy strategy, the previously chosen line of the cautious "middle path" is clearly traced; it can only be understood by carefully studying the features of Mongolian civilization.

AB Manuel Ancizar Basterra belonged to a galaxy of prominent liberal figures in Colombia, an intellectual elite who played an important role in transforming the socio-economic and political life of the country in the era of the liberal revolution of the mid-19th century. His activities were multifaceted: a politician and a public figure, a diplomat and a scientist, a journalist and a publisher, a costumbrist writer, a mason and a lawyer. But above all, he was a humanist and educator who devoted his life to Colombia, where, being of Spanish origin, he was born, and which became his real homeland. In 2015 UNESCO, within the framework of the World Heritage Program, has granted the private archive of M. Ancizar the status of a documentary heritage of mankind. In this work, for the first time in Russian historiography, an attempt is made to trace the main stages of M. Ancizar's life, to assess his contribution to the development of publishing, participation in the Chorographic expedition (1850-1859), his activities as rector of the National University.

AB The paper analyses one of the issues of the eastern policy of Russia of the Peter's era, related to the creation of the Russian-Ottoman frontier on the territory west to the Caspian Sea. The difficulties in the process of carrying out demarcation in the border zone caused by the negative reaction of various actors in the border life are discussed. The author introduces a new source - a historical map of the Caspian territories, on which the border between the Russian and Ottoman Empire is drawn; demarcation work, conducted by the committee, is shown. The study reveals that the Russian-Ottoman border line divided the communities of the East Transcaucasia without consideration of historical traditions of conducting economic activity and ethnocultural contacts, thus certain difficulties and unsteadiness occurred in the border zone. The reaction of the frontier participants make it possible, in general, to determine the attitude of the Caucasian and Persian political elites to the emergence of the Russian and Ottoman Empires in the Caucasus-Caspian region. The obtained scientific results are unique from the point of view of humanitarian knowledge, and they can be used for further development of various issues of the Caucasian foreign policy of the Russian and Ottoman Empires of the 18th century by Russian and foreign researchers.

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to the analysis of the formation and spread of protest discourse in new practices of protest behavior. Online rallies, which appeared in 2020 in the public space of Russia, remained an unobtrusive practice, despite their potential applicability within the framework of a single logic of "competitive politics". Methods and materials. The research methodology is based on the theory of "relative deprivation" (T. Garr), "competitive politics" (C. Tilly) and the theory of "network society" (M. Castells). As specific research methods, the author used a selective analysis of cases of protests in the period 2018-2021(42 actions in 26 regions of the Russian Federation), as well as discourse analysis, which made it possible to determine the topic of protest actions. Analysis. The political discourse of protest is a communicative space for the construction of common symbols and identity of the movement. The formation of discourse takes place in the online space, which is due to the development and simplicity of communication between individuals. Results. On the basis of the analysis, some conclusions were drawn about the specifics of the formation of protest discourse in the online environment: 1. Discourse is formed in open online platforms, such as groups in VKontakte, Telegram chats or Internet forums; 2. Protest communities are engaged in information and mobilization functions regardless of the number of participants (at the same time, the effectiveness of audience engagement and, as a result, feedback will differ significantly); 3. The main topic of protest actions is represented by opportunistic problems of a civil nature, where there is an immanent opportunity for the transformation of discourse into a political (anti-political) one; 4. The most popular (the number of likes and comments) are posts in groups on social networks containing a direct call to participate in rallies, as well as short emotional slogans and memes.

DE Mikhail I. Rostovtzeff; Roman Empire; image; Social and Economic History
   of the Roman Empire; history of Rome; modern historiography
AB The article examines the features of the image of the Roman Empire created by the outstanding historian M. I. Rostovtzeff, primarily in his "Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire". This image is contradictory and ambiguous. It involves a lot of genuine innovative ideas, bright colours, but there are also a number of obvious exaggerations and aberrations, a certain "contemporization" of economic and social realities. Paradoxically, Rostovtzeff's Roman Empire turns out to be an empire without imperialism. Its very "empireness", i. e., specific ties between the center and provincial and "barbaric" periphery; the organization of space; the modes of relations between the "imperial nation" and the subordinate peoples; the unity of diversity as well as geographical (geopolitical) and economic determination of Roman imperial expansion, remains outside the historian's scope. At the same time, Rostovtzeff perspicaciously grasps the deep drama of Roman history, irreducible either to the tyranny and extravagance of individual rulers or to the merciless struggle of social classes. A significant role in creating such a comprehensive image of the Roman Empire was ensured not only by Rostovtzeff's political preferences and life experience, but also by his personality and style of scholarship. This gives the "Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire" a special dimension, making it not only a fact of historiography per se but the substantial evidence of the indissoluble relationship between the personality of the historian, his ideas and the time in which he happened to live and work.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of differences in the approaches of European Union member states to the inclusion of migrants into the political community by granting them citizenship. These differences are operationalized through the category of "citizenship regimes". The article distinguishes three types of citizenship regimes - liberal, restrictive, and mixed. Whether a particular regime can be categorized into one of these citizenship regime types is determined on the basis of three indicators: (1) application/non-application of birthright citizenship (jus soli), (2) the presence of the institution of dual (multiple) citizenship, and (3) the relative simplicity/complexity of the naturalization procedure. At the same time, due to the lack of the comprehensive statistical data, which would allow assessing all possible components of this procedure, in order to evaluate the degree of the simplicity/complexity of the procedure, the authors focus on such a parameter as the minimum time period of residence in the country required to apply for citizenship.
   Having considered the evolution of the legal systems of the EU states, the authors reveal important differences in the approaches to the naturalization of migrants along the axis between the "old" countries of the European Union, on the one hand, and new members of the United Europe from the former socialist countries, on the other. While the "old" EU members tend to gradually liberalize citizenship regimes, the new ones are leaning towards a restrictive model, which manifests itself both in the difficult conditions of naturalization and rejection of the birthright citizenship law. The convergence of the positions of these two groups of countries on this issue is not visible.

AB Introduction. Recently, the interest of representatives of the expert and scientific community has been growing in the transformations of one of the most famous practices of rebel activity after the Second World War - the Maoist model of people's war. Its interpretations in the framework of expert support for the foreign policy activities of the USA are prompted with great attention and caution not only to the role of methodological restrictions, disciplinary filters, the intellectual climate and relations with customers of analytic products of this kind. No less important, as this article shows, are the transfers of ideas and practical experience - the usual debate about the export of democratic and socialist models of development during the Cold War often consists of a scientific discussion on the periphery of the question of the importance of exporting the Chinese model of people's war in the history of international relations after 1945. Methods and materials. Interdisciplinarity is the feature of research. The search for the political connotations in the RAND reports wrote during the Cold War and devoted to the experience of counterinsurgency in Manchuria during the 1930s demanded the use of the methods practiced by the historical and political sciences simultaneously. Analysis. Accordingly, particular attention was paid to the peculiarities of expert support for decision-making in the United States at the initial stage of the Cold War in the context of the RAND activities, which in the framework of cooperation with the Ministry of Defense practically monopolized the analytical support of American politics in Vietnam and South-East Asia as a whole in the organization of counterinsurgency in the 1960s. The focus of the research is the study by RAND experts of the historical experience of previous powers on the example of forms and methods of anti-insurgency activities of the leadership of the Manchukuo and Kwantung army in Manchuria which reveals both the phenomenon and the causes of the distortion of historical realities of the Interbellum era during the Cold War. Results. The RAND experts thought that the Chinese case of the Interbellum offered the answers on two major questions of tactics and strategy of counterinsurgency in the "Third world": on the enemy, as well as on the ways and methods to crush him. But methodological self-containment lessened critical value of that memorandum and made it more easer the infiltration of the key ideas about the Chinese model of the people's war widely presented in the government, military and political circles of the USA during the 1960s into the research made by the RAND Corporation experts.

AB The phenomenon of modernity excite people, presumably, from the moment when a person became a reflexive being: perceiving himself as a creature living in time and space, surrounded by other objects and subjects; as an active creature. Acting and speaking. Language - is a way of encrypting / decrypting the world - in time immemorial turned out to be the cornerstone of the appearance of a person / subject, and together with a person / subject and modernity as situation of existential problematization of the current moment of individual life. A man as a subject has existed since the emergence of language and reflective consciousness. Likewise, modernity, which is the primary element of culture and civilization, is eternal to man: from the link man-time, subject-modernity, culture arises, civilization is born, all forms of human existence arise. Modernity is a derivative of human rootedness in time. Hence its permanent character: it is the result of a human-human dialogue and human reflection, permanently unfolding in time. Hence, permanent modernity, which structurally, as shown in the article, consists of the following elements: 1) civilization (foundations set by conditions and reflected in the mentality, assimilated a priori), 2) modernity (a stable value scale of civilization, expressed in artistic practice and forms of political request, including at the level of theses: "time is money", "Reason, Emancipation, Progress", etc.), 3) culture (forms of social life in modern conditions, accepting micro- and macro-forms), 4) postmodernity (situations groping for new foundations, unfolding in the horizon of culture, but with the goal of modernity and civilization), 5) the intercivilizational era (the position of breakdown), 6) the subject (a person who realizes his own self and creates a project for a social future), 7) a multitude (a community of followers, emerging around the subject), 8) politics (procedures for the implementation of modernity in the field of intersubjectivity, the final mechanism of cultural transformation, where do not merge love, philosophy and art, and the main movers are the subject, utopia and revolution, hidden in the space of everyday life). At the same time, civilization and politics form a staticdynamic whole, within the boundaries of which culture in the broad sense of the word develops and unfolds.

AB The author examines the compatibility of the interests and policies of the European Union (EU) and Turkey in the Balkans. After the admission of several Balkan countries to the EU, Brussels focused on the remaining six countries termed as "Western Balkans". Turkey's policy covers the entire peninsula, including Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia and Montenegro. Ankara pursued its interests through NATO in the 1990s, and the EU in the 2000s. Brussels and Ankara worked jointly. In the 2010s, the EU and Turkey started to act in parallel. Economic and humanitarian issues turned out to be dominant, and Turkey actively promoted trilateral cooperation initiatives. In addition to bilateral relations, involving political, military, economic and humanitarian dimensions, Turkey supports the multilateral cooperation between different Balkan institutions. Some commentators consider the EU and Turkey to be partners, while others argue that they are rather competitors. However, the situation is more complicated. In the Balkans Ankara's and Brussels' priorities mostly diverge. Whilst EU's policy is coherent and long term, Turkey's Balkan policy looks contradictory due to the incompatibility between the support of the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Balkan countries and purely regional initiatives. The author determines this situation as Turkey's Balkan dilemma. Yet, Turkey's European integration prospects are under question. In the Balkans, Turkey's national and regional interests have collided with the geopolitical goals of the EU, which barely includes a place for Turkey.

AB The article presents the essence and functional aspects of political manipulation in traditional and modernization space. The authors pay attention to different variants of conceptualization of this phenomenon, distinguish its theoretical, historical and technological dimension. The work shows the close correlation of the study of political manipulation with the branching of ideas in the field of philosophical, political science and legal comprehension of the social sphere. Particular attention is paid to the specifics and technologies of political manipulation under the conditions of digitalization of Russian and international political space, which entailed radical qualitative changes in this area of ideological and other influences on the mass political consciousness. The authors substantiate that in the digital era of development of socio-political interaction, the phenomenon of "manipulation" is qualitatively complicated and transformed both semantically and technologically. The content of the research proves that political manipulation becomes total and systemic, because the society has not yet formed adequate sociopolitical and legal forms of prevention and counteraction to this phenomenon, and the available theoretical-methodological and praxiological tools do not grasp a number of ontological and technological manifestations of digital political manipulation, which makes the latter extremely elusive.

AB The paper examines the results of reforms in the remuneration system of university lecturers. Two stages of the transformation process have been considered: the transition to the new remuneration system in 2008 and the introduction of effective contracts in 2012. The paper explains how the political and bureaucratic mechanisms of the formation of the remuneration system have changed. We have made an attempt to describe the government failures in the implementation of effective contracts. It is assumed that the new mechanism remains over-regulated and is based on the idea of the local nature of the academic labor market. The imitation regulation is considered to be one of the most important reasons of the state failures. On the one hand, the government manifested the establishment of understandable and achievable indicators, on the other hand, the authorities failed to solve real problems of the production and transfer of the new knowledge. Governmental stakeholders in education are interested in maintaining and further expanding of their functions. Meanwhile, insufficient professionalism in decision-making and shorttermism become the reasons for inefficient waste of budgetary resources for the indicators production and elaboration of various of insurance procedures. The study shows that for many universities the achievement of the target salary level is associated with serious difficulties. There are also significant differences in remuneration systems between universities. Interregional differences in the level of wages of university staff create different conditions for investment in the human capital of university lecturers and incentives for interregional staff turnover that weakens the resource potential of universities in a number of regions.

DT Article
DE COVID-19; coronavirus; pandemic; expertise; expert knowledge;
   post-truth; postmodern; authority; legitimation; paternalism
AB The article analyzes the reasons for the important effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has become the catalyst for long-overdue decline in the authority of expert knowledge. The author claims that widespread access to information and scientific data results in the collapse of universal and monopolistic expert-scientific hierarchies of knowledge of a large society, controlled by the state. Scientific experts, who acted as the historical heirs of priests and shamans, have lost their privileged access to sacred knowledge, made public by the media and the Internet. This resulted in severe damage to the key function of expertise - legitimization of the political order and power elites. Experts without the status of agents of the state have become indistinguishable from ordinary citizens. The example of discussions between Waxers and Anti-Waxers shows that both sides are able to put forward convincing scientific arguments that rhetorically do not allow the authorities to bring the discussion about the effectiveness of vaccinations down to a completely unobvious dispute between enlightened state experts and uneducated obscurantists. It is in the most developed Western states where one can see a strong civil dissident movement that distrusts or calls into question the disciplinary regimes of collective coexistence, legitimized by the paternalistic rhetoric of concern from political elites. Accordingly, the elites in the background situation of strengthening the practices of heterarchy, post-truth and postmodernism can no longer rely on the usual metanarratives of the Enlightenment, which allowed them to monopolize the discourse of science in the name of progress and unconditional good, building hierarchies of knowledge-power convenient for their priorities. Since science, knowledge and information have long became public domain, the line between elites, experts and citizens in the field of access to science has become almost indistinguishable. The actual political problem is that the situation of collision of different paradigms, opinions and data is exactly the normal state of science, which is now transferred to the field of public discussions following the final secularization of science. Thus, the institution of expert knowledge turns into an unnecessary link in a situation of equal access of all interested parties to scientific data; to an institution that hardly would efficiently perform the functions of scientific legitimation of socially significant decisions in the foreseeable future.

AB The object of the author's study is Hungarians in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina of the Republic of Serbia at the present stage of history. The aim of the article is to identify the qualitative parameters of the maintenance and development of the identity of this ethnic group in the conditions of living outside the "parent" state. The study focuses on several thematic blocks as important indicators of the functioning of ethnicity in this sector of the population. It provides a demographic portrait of Vojvodina Hungarians, highlights legislative guarantees of ethnic minority rights and other forms of state support in the country of residence, and provides information on the social and political activity, as well as cultural, educational and awareness-raising activities of Hungarians in Serbia, primarily in Vojvodina. Particular attention is paid to the peculiarities of the autonomous structure of the province.
   The socio-anthropological analytical approach to the analysis of empirical material allows one to reach the level of theoretical generalization, to identify the role of state borders as a factor of influence not only on the civil identity, but also on the formation of cultural and everyday features of diaspora groups as a result of constant contacts with ethnically foreign neighbors. The author provides evidence of the high level of development of Serbia's legal framework in terms of maintaining cultural diversity in the country, creating a wide range of social and domestic conditions necessary to maintain and develop ethnic identity among national minorities, including Hungarians. At the same time, the data from the censuses of various years in Serbia show a gradual decrease in the number of Hungarians in recent decades. The negative trend is explained by their low fertility, as well as by the migratory mobility of the inhabitants of Vojvodina, for economic and other reasons, which are often not directly related to identity issues. Moreover, Hungarian identity becomes an additional resource in the choice of the most promising life strategies of the younger generation.

AB The article deals with individual factors of the functioning of science and scientific knowledge on their internal and external contours. As a working hypothesis, we put forward the thesis that science has a specific sociality, which is based on (1) a certain type of humanism common among researchers, and (2) localized in a special space - the space of a research laboratory. During the formation of modern science, it was these two factors that shaped science, firstly, as a system of values, the main purpose of which was and remains the search for truth, and secondly, as a social structure, the organization of which must satisfy the desired ideal. The transformation of these basic factors of the functioning of science in the modern world leads not only to the emergence of new actors in the scientific space, but also to the need to revise the classic forms of functioning and interaction of the scientific community both within itself and with non-scientific institutions. A scientific laboratory is one of the meeting places and intersections of the external and internal contours of science. Scientific research takes place in it, but it also forms the infrastructure necessary for the society to use their results. On the one hand, it spreads scientific values beyond scientific institutions, and on the other hand, it reassembles scientific practices so that they can either exist outside the walls of laboratories. Therefore, both for the social and cognitive contexts of the consideration of science, the laboratory has a special status. It not only forms the values and image of the scientist inside and outside the scientific community, but also becomes a key element in the social structure of the production and dissemination of knowledge.In modern conditions, the laboratory has another specific feature. It can no longer be viewed simply as a specific location. Rather, we can talk about its distributed nature. It includes various departments responsible for the creation of equipment or software associated with interaction with scientific and non-scientific actors. It breaks up into many connections and relationships that require the efforts of its participants to maintain. As a result, the distributed nature of the laboratory allows maintaining in the social system a set of values associated with openness to new things and the ability to introduce scientific achievements into social life.

TI THE NOTION IN HEGEL'S SUBJECTIVE LOGIC

DE notion; Hegel; science of logic; metaphysics of subjectivity; reason;

AB The article considers the Notion within subjective logic in Hegel's Science of Logic. Hegel defines the Notion as " self-relating negation" or negative self-referential free identity. The usual meaning of `notion', that is as a rule of thinking an object (which Hegel calls `finite determinations of conceiving'), is to distinguished from the Notion in the specific Hegelian use. "The Notion" is the chapter that scrutinizes metaphysical categories of subjectivity and personhood from pragmatic, epistemological, and practical perspectives. Subjectivity is analyzed through its functions and operations that constitute the essence of (collective) subjectivity and are implemented by it in forms of judgement, inference, etc. Thus, the Notion is a "logical" (i.e. metaphysical) analysis of collective epistemic and practical agency or the system of science considered in its strictly abstract metaphysical structure. The universal Notion (der allgemeine Begriff) signifies the general ability of thinking (which Kant calls the I, Self) and the abstract (empty) universe of discourse. This minimal subjectivity and space of reasoning can perceive (in thought) and accommodate broad content, turning it into narrow content by placing it "ideally", in our minds or as content of collective practices (science, etc.). The particular Notion (der besondere Begriff) is the ability to subsume under given rules or concepts or the ability to follow the already given rules (Kant called it conceiving, Verstand). The content of conceiving fills the abstract universe of reasoning, and we can interpret it as conceptual scheme. The particular Notion is adequate for thinking of content from the perspective of its seriality and regularity, general functions or rules. That is adequate for the cognition of physical processes in nature, rigid and pre-determined laws and regularities that captures things in their repeatability. The singular Notion (der einzelne Begriff) is the ability to reflect and think of the mind and reason themselves as the only unique thing and individual things in their singularity. All stages of the Notion are free and spontaneous, but the highest stage of freedom turns out to be the singular Notion.

AB The article examines the significance and degree of the US involvement in Italian politics, the chronological logic of America's role in the country's political life through the prism of the national Italy's archetype. The authors chose foreign policy and military components as the base for the research because they clearly demonstrate the nature of the US influence in Italy. The article provides a contemporarypicture of the positions of the main Italian parties in relation to the American administration. The study examines the relationship between the US administrations and Italian prime ministers and their differences from previous periods. The authors argue that, through the United States, Italy is trying to assert its role at the regional and global levels, combining the principles of loyalty to both EU and U.S. For the United States Italy with its current political configuration represents a comfortable and reliable partner. The authors conclude that pro-American forces have always been present on the political Italy's scene and despite the fact that relations between the two countries in the short and medium term are determined by the political situation at a particular moment. There is no doubt about Italy's intention to maintain of strategic partnership with the United States, whis is perceived as a foreign policy benchmark.

DT Article
DE European integration project; political equilibrium; globaliza-tion;
   sovereignty; legitimacy; Machiavellian moment
AB The European integration project, after 70 years of the successful implementation, is now facing a significant number of difficulties caused by the process of globalization. The list of these difficulties includes: (1) the incompleteness of the process of formation of the European identity; (2) the deepening contradiction between two fundamental legal principles - transnational and national constitutionalism; (3) the growing asymmetry between the European regions; (4) dramatic disputes over migration issues; (5) the ideological confrontation between liberal and illiberal democracies. This situation, exacerbated by the challenges of globalization and officially defined today as the "existential crisis" of the EU, revealed certain significant flaws in the current integration model hung between confederalism and federalism. The shortcomings, such as weakened democratic legitimacy, ineffective decision-making and the absence of clear and stable European leadership, have resulted in the growing spread of Euroscepticism and right-wing populism, as well as the erosion of Europe's mission in the world.
   The increasingly obvious threat of a loss of political balance in Eu-rope makes it important to comprehend the potential directions and scope of changes in the EU integration project, to assess the hypothetically possible le-gal and institutional forms of the new integration model and their political im-plications. The author describes the current situation as a Machiavellian mo-ment in Europe: under the conditions when the preservation of the status quo only reinforces the contradictions within the integration project, the European elites are faced with the necessity to make a clear choice between a confederal and a federal system in order to find a new legitimizing formula for this fading project, and it should be done as soon as possible.

DT Article
DE collective memory; identity; symbolic coding of past; memory studies;
   cultural sociology; Paul Ricoeur
AB A typology of theoretical approaches to the study of collective memory developed in the 20th century is proposed in this article. The main difference of the selected sociological and cultural-sociological approaches to its conceptualization is shown. The first approach (Anthony Giddens, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Foucault, Ulrich Beck, Niklas Luhmann, and others) focuses on structures and reified values. Thereby it implicitly inserts memory into the mechanism of reproduction of social structures and allows identifying it with ideology as a "false consciousness". The theoretical significance of this approach is that within its framework the concept of memory was associated with the concept of identity. The idea of Zygmunt Bauman about the need to study not only identities, but also processes of open identification was of great importance. According to this idea the memory of a collective must be viewed as a constant process of reactivation, correlated with changes in culture. The second approach explores the transformation of symbolic values attached to events of the past by collective memory without reduction to the state of social structure. As the theoretical foundation of this approach, the author proposes the "strong program" of the sociology of culture by Jeffrey Alexander. The advantage of the culturological approach is that it allows revealing the connection between the strategies of collective memory and the dominant temporal images of culture (Zygmunt Bauman, Aleida Assmann, Andreas Huyssen, Pierre Norah, Hermann Ltibbe) So, the dependence of the new relevance of memory for European culture on the crisis of the ideology of modernity and the onset of the postmodern era with its awareness of the impossibility of finding the past is shown. In conclusion, the necessity of complementarity of the above mentioned approaches is substantiated. As a variant of the theoretical basis of such complementarity, the project of Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic anthropology is proposed. It is shown that, through the concepts of "mutuality" and "reciprocity" used by Ricoeur as moduses of social being, it is possible to reveal the relationship between the two levels of collective memory functioning: the level of meanings and the level of establishing social existence.

DE USSR; Soviet past; United Russia; Communist Party of the Russian
   Federation; political rhetoric; discursive strategies; politics of

AB The article is devoted to the study of the specificities of the use of the Soviet past in the rhetoric of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and the United Russia. Based on the analysis of the texts of the leaders and functionaries of these parties, the authors reveal the goals of addressing the Soviet heritage, the distinguishing features of its interpretation, the invoked discursive strategies and macrosemantic structures. The authors show how interpreting the Soviet past and establishing its connection with the present and future of Russia serve the tasks of political identification of the party and legitimization of its position.
   According to the authors' conclusion, the specifics of the studied parties' appeal to the Soviet legacy is largely determined by the position they occupy in the country's political system, as well as the history of their creation and development. With the help of the references to the USSR and certain aspects of its existence, representatives of the United Russia are trying to legitimize the current political course. By focusing on the achievements of the Soviet period, they demonstrate the historical continuity of the current political regime and its orientation towards stability; while by noting the shortcomings of the Soviet system, they highlight how current regime is different and emphasize its successes. Representatives of the United Russia use analogies with political organizations of the past to self-identify as a force that supports and largely ensures the course towards strengthening the Russian state, as well as to present the non-systemic opposition and external players as forces that undermine its stability.
   The main purpose of referring to the Soviet past in the texts of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation is to demonstrate the continuity of the party in relation to the Soviet period, with the latter being interpreted mostly positively. At the same time, the appeal to certain events of the past allows communists to criticize the current domestic political course, present themselves as an opposition force and support the actions of the Russian government in the international arena.

ID THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
AB The fact that four hemispheres are marked on the globe, but only two of those possess their poles, is presented in the article as a metaphor for the need of referring to the structure of objectivity when one formulates the problems and results of research in the humanities. The metaphor illustrates the role of axiomatic syntax. This role is specifically manifested in the evaluation of epistemic success in formal philosophical discussions, i.e., during the defense of qualification works or the experts' assessment of initiative research. The study is carried out on the basis of the concept of "epistemic virtues" (Lorrsine Daston, Peter Galison) and the methodological consequences of this concept which have been presented in works on mapping the space of thought experiments as well as in works performed with the involvement of the ideas of modern theoretical geography and semiotics. The geographic metaphor of the poles, firstly, demonstrates the navigational role of philosophy in the construction of cognitive maps. Axiomatic planes and/or decision spaces are a particular case of such maps. The syntax of epistemic virtues forms a "compass needle". Secondly, it serves as an illustration of the fact that any conventional distinctions (and/or any configurations of conceptual constructions) make sense only if the limits of structural objectivity are observed. And, thirdly, the metaphor demonstrates that the paths of arguments lose their meaning on those cognitive maps that are created assuming the existence not so much of the West and East poles as in the spaces absurdly given by the West and North or East and South Poles.

AB The proclamation of independent Latvia in 1920 should be analyzed from the standpoint of political realism as a theory of international relations. In this regard, we can talk about four large-scale external factors that had a fundamental impact on the formation of the Latvian statehood in the period 1917-1920: 1) the Russian factor; 2) the German factor; 3) the influence of the Entente countries; 4) the influence of neighboring states of the region (Estonia, Poland, Finland, Sweden). The main internal factors that determined the state independence of Latvia were the rapid economic development of the region, primarily due to close ties with the Russian imperial market, and the strengthening of ideas of national independence among the political elites of the future Latvia. It is concluded that independent Latvia appeared on the map of Europe as a result of complex historical processes and as part of a change in the general model of Europe's development, moving from empires to nation states.

DE noncognitivism; metaethics; moral reasoning; state of affairs
AB One of the problems that noncognitivism faces as a metaethical position is that, if its premises are true, then any inference that concludes to a fact based on premises that include a moral claim is an inference from the speaker's non-cognitive state. In this case, the form of such an inference turns out to be similar to the so-called wishful thinking, which is unacceptable. A dilemma arises, where the first option is rejection of moral arguments in favor of facts, and the second option is rejection of noncognitivism. Is treating moral reasoning as wishful thinking evidence against noncognitivism? In the article, we consider the grounds for positive and negative answers to this question. We also put forward a new argument against noncognitivism, connected with the problem of explication of the foundations of a moral claim.

DE mystical experience; constructivism; essentialism
AB The article is dedicated to the study of approaches to the definition of the epistemological meaning of mystical experience. A researcher cannot confidently assert that a mystical experience took place if they do not know whether a mystical experience is the result of interaction with some transcendent reality. Since neither empirical nor logical verification of statements conveying mystical experience is possible, the only means of verification is the "background knowledge" of tradition that legitimized the individual experience of the mystical. The definition of the determinants of this knowledge is the subject of many years of discussions between essentialists and constructivists. The former speak about the essential constants of mystical experience, which in different traditions are transmitted by different symbols, but are an expression of the same thing - superreality. The latter, arguing that the content of discourse about mystical experience cannot be studied separately from the religious and cultural tradition, as well as from language, deny the single essence of mystical experience. Based on the analysis of the arguments of essentialists and constructivists, the article proposes to consider anthropological (associated with transformations of personality or consciousness) and sociocultural contexts as forming the content of mystical experience. At the same time, mystical experience is presented as the result of a specific activity - aimed at something that is considered a supernatural (transcendent) reality by the subject of experience and the tradition in which this subject is included. The researcher notices changes in the activity of an individual who states about own experiences of the transcendent reality, and has a reason to speak about the acquisition of a specific experience by the individual. Leaving out of the field of research judgments about the supernatural source of mystical experience and other similar statements as subjective explanations of mystical experience on the part of its bearers, the researcher can consider mystical experience as an anthropological phenomenon, i.e., the result of a specific human activity.

AB The article is devoted to the consideration of the concept of "nation" in the political thought of Piedmont during the French Revolution and French occupation. Analysis of political writings of 1799 - early 1800s. shows that both radical and moderate Republicans, members of various clubs and societies, actively participated in the discussion about the fate of Piedmont. The idea of the French government and part of the Italian republicans to annex Piedmont to the French Republic provoked strong resistance among intellectuals. The Patriots of 1799 saw the creation of a special Piedmont republic as part of the project for the future unification of Italy. They substantiated the sovereignty of the "Piedmontese nation" or "subalpine people" by appealing to the feeling of local patriotism, national character, language, history, traditions and faith. The influence of the intellectuals of Piedmont in the late 18th century is analyzed on the establishment of traditions of political particularism and local nationalism in the revolutionary period. It is noted that the idea of a special "Piedmont nation" was also developed in the political literature of the era of Napoleonic rule in Italy.

AB Contemporary French historiography of the Revolution of the 18(th) century is closely connected with the achievements of historians from other countries. Nevertheless, many factors contribute to the fact that it is French scholars that have regained their pre-eminent position. Today, the concept of popular anti-revolution, developed since the 1980s by C. Lucas, R. Dupuy and J.-C. Martin acquired a special significance for the French national memory and actualizes a new appeal to the topic of << banditry >> (<< brigandage >>). This category at the turn of the 18(th) and 19(th) centuries was very vague. The << bandits >> of the era of the Directory and Napoleon were all those who committed crimes against the state and were << outside the law >> (rebels, political opposition, robbers, etc.). The author of the article analyzes the correspondent historiographic situation at the current moment. The particular attention is paid to the generalizing works of V. Sottocasa, Y. Bos. and M. Belissa. The author shows that a turn in French studies of these subjects is just planned: it is necessary also to develop a new categorical apparatus, move from the study of discourse and the legal side of this issue to historical anthropology and erase the chronological barriers of the topic.

DT Article
DE Chura bey Narykov; dastan "Chura Batyr"; Kazan Khanate; epic; diplomat;
   figure; historical
AB Research objectives: To reconstruct the image of Chura, the son of Naryk (Chura Narykov) - a political figure and historical personality of the period of the Kazan Khanate - based on a comparison of the historical epic with the history of the Tatar khanates in the first half of sixteenth century.
   Research materials: The author analyzes various historical sources and literature with information about the real personality of Chura Narykov, his life, and his work. She focuses on the history of the Kazan Khanate in the sixteenth century and analyzes the texts of dastans collected and published by Russian and foreign scholars from the second half of nineteenth century, along with archival and published epic texts in various versions dedicated to Chura Batyr which were distributed and recorded by Tatar-speaking informants in the Volga region. In turn, information about Chura Narykov as a real person is contained in Russian chronicles, the anonymous "Kazan history" of the sixteenth century, and in publications of Kh. Atlasi (1993), R. Fakhretdin (1995), M. Khudyakov (1990), A.Kh Khalikov (1992), D.M. Iskhakov (1994, 1997, 2017), S.Kh. Alishev (1995), A.-Z. Validi (1992), and others.
   Results and novelty of the research: The author draws parallels between historical reality and the epic Chura-batyr, addresses the problems of the historical explanation of the rich material of folk art, and reveals the commonality between reality and epic works about Chura-batyr. The study systematically proves the relevance - in the history of the Turkic peoples - of political events associated with the Tatar khanates that existed until the late Middle Ages, focusing on the fact that during this period Kazan was a major political center of important events of a global scale. Key aspects of the topic raised in the study contribute to a more detailed study of the history of the Golden Horde and the Tatar khanates, determining the role and historical significance of the Tatar version of the dastan about Churabatyr along with other Turkic versions and variants. The historical personality of Chura Narykov is considered as a prototype of not only the Tatar, but also the Turkic historical and heroic epic.

DT Article
DE institutional-matrix approach; civil society; civic participation;
   degrees of freedom; Russia
AB This publication is a sequel to polemics that took place between me and S.G. Kirdina-Chandler in the journal "Socis" in 2016 about the concept of "civil society". The essence of the polemics was that S.G. Kirdina-Chandler recognizes civil society not as a universal or general scientific concept, but as an "ideologeme" formed by Western European civilization, based on the Y-matrix, and imposed on other societies and peoples as a model of self-evaluation and imitation. My position consisted in the recognition of civil society as a universal notion, which presupposes the advancement of all mankind from socio-economic independence to the highest degrees of freedom - political, moral, religious and creative. S.G. Kirdina-Chandler argued that, empirically, the "law of stability of the dominant matrix institutions" was found to prevent the replacement of the basic institutions by the dominant matrix, and that in Russia "collectivism" rather than "individualism", "redistributiveness" rather than competition, the value of "order" rather than freedom, orientation to some common good rather than to the private interest of citizens will always predominate. The material-natural environment is recognized as the fundamental basis of this dominance. The latest historical events allow us to recognize the historical correctness of S.G. Kirdina-Chandler's institutional-matrix approach, namely, the return of Russian society to the dominating role of X-matrix institutions - distributive economy, centralized management and communitarian ideology. The institutional-matrix approach allows to assume that in several decades the potential of X-matrix institutions may be exhausted, and then the Russian society will start to activate the institutions of private property, market economy, real federalism, political pluralism and competitiveness, spiritual freedom and civil society. In 2022 we must, however, recognize that the bid for global geopolitical and military-political competition from Russia has been made, and active mobilization of all X-institutions has begun.

DE Republic of Tuva; Republic of Kalmykia; regional politics; woman in
   politics; gender imbalance; gender stereotype; political culture
AB The aim of the research was to study gender differences in Russian regional policy in the cases of the republics of Tuva and Kalmykia. The data for the analysis consist of active rolls of the officials working in government agencies in the republics as well as the results of a sociological study conducted there in January - March 2022. The latter was pursued through in-depth and expert interviews and dealt with the issue of perception of women's role and potential in regional politics and government. The expert interviewees comprised public and political figures of different times. We analyzed the existing gender stereotypes, assessments of women's potential in regional politics as well as a comparison of men's and women's positions. An analysis of the composition of the leadership staff of the legislative bodies of the two regions, the highest bodies of executive power, and ministries has found out that the number of active female politicians is quite small. Some regional features have been revealed: in Tuva, women are more represented in the parliament, while in Kalmykia, there are more women in the government of the region. Despite the high socioeconomic activity of women, a higher level of their education and, in general, their numerical predominance, patriarchal views on the role of females in politics and gender stereotypes are quite strong in both republics. According to these social biases, politics is a male sphere. In addition to the gender stereotypes in the regions under consideration, there are strong economic and sociopsychological barriers to women. They prevent females from being more active in regional politics. A common feature of public opinion in the two republics is that many people are unprepared for the fact that women can hypothetically lead the regions. At the same time, the political potential of females is estimated to be higher in Kalmykia than in Tuva. This fact was confirmed when a woman was appointed the Chairman of the Government of the Republic of Kalmykia in September 2022. An analysis of statements of female respondents has shown that women are ready to "sacrifice" their careers, including political ones, for the sake of the family, and statements of male respondents confirm the patriarchal nature of Tuvan and Kalmyk societies.

TI REGIONALISM IN THE "MESSAGES" OF THE HEADS OF SUBJECTS OF THE RUSSIAN
   FEDERATION: A DISCURSIVE PERSPECTIVE
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE regionalism; regional identity; regional elites; heads of Russian
   regions; message; discourse analysis
AB This article discusses a system of indicators that help to analyze regionalist discourse in the rhetoric of the heads of subjects of the Russian Federation. The first block reflects various aspects that make up the objective capital of regional specifics (historical and cultural uniqueness, economic specifics, political features, natural and geographical markers of place features). The second block is "cultural regionalism and regional identity" (representing the region as a unique space for the country, nominating the regional community, naming specific brands of the region, names of "cultural heroes", etc.). The third block is the positioning of the region in relation to the federal center. Based on the analysis of 62 texts, it is shown that in the vast majority of cases, the understanding of the specifics of the region in the messages is carried out taking into account historical and cultural features. Geographical and natural markers are usually used with the purpose of demonstrating the tourist capital of the region, economic markers serve to characterize the potential of the territory, and its leadership in various ratings. The concept of identity as a resource for the development of a place is poorly represented in the texts of the chapters. The concepts used here are related to such concepts as "land", "face", "regional character", "cultural code" of the region. Three strategies were identified, according to which the contexts of mentioning the word "federal" were correlated. The first model is paternalistic, in which the region "expects help" and is "grateful for it" to the federal center. The second model is represented by the partner speech strategy. Within the framework of it, in the discourse of the head of state, the region acts as an equal participant in interaction with the federal Center. The third model is conditionally neutral and is related to the reporting data on federal programs. It is found that in the regions where the most intense discussions about the specifics of the territory are presented, the intensity of the discourse of regional identity is frequently higher. In such message texts, regionalism is articulated in the aspect of cultural regionalism. Political regionalism as the relationship between the region and the center is formalized by a neutral agenda.

DT Editorial Material
DE absolutism; autocracy; military revolution theory; Ivan the Terrible;
   Boyar Duma; oprichnina; level of taxation
AB The article is devoted to the interpretation of socio- political processes during the reign of Ivan the Terrible from the standpoint of the theory of military revolution. Following the well-known work of B. Downing, the author identifies ten stages in the evolution of the medieval monarchy to militarybureaucratic absolutism. Such cases are described in the history of the Scandinavian states. Further, the socio-political processes of the times of Ivan the Terrible are analyzed from the point of view of their correspondence to the distinguished steps. It is concluded that these processes follow the scheme of B. Downing. The starting point of development is the medieval monarchy, in which the power of the suzerain is limited to assemblies (conditionally, << parliaments >>), where aristocrats predominate, managing the resources of their land holdings. The military revolution downgrades the importance of chivalry and requires the creation of a large army of firearms-wielding mercenary infantrymen. Funding a new army requires a reallocation of resources to the detriment of the aristocracy. The << Parliaments >> resist these demands, and a conflict ensues between the monarchs and the aristocracy. The new army ensures the victory of the monarchs. Monarchs abolish << parliaments >> or deprive them of real powers. The victorious monarchs subdue the nobility, take away some of its resources. Reforms are being carried out, a new financial system is being created. A new bureaucracy is being created, and commoners are recruited for positions. The nobility is trying to fit into these new structures by taking office positions. Taking into account the criticism of the concept of << absolutism >> in the context of the possibility of informal compromises between the monarch and the aristocracy, the author confines himself to considering cases where such compromises obviously could not have happened, when the monarch completely subordinated the aristocracy. The author notes that this conclusion is preliminary, and the problem requires further detailed research.

DE Kripke-Wittgenstein paradox; semantic non-factualism; rule-following;
   private language argument; communitarian sceptical solution; Boyd's
   hypothesis
AB The article contains a critical analysis of the skeptical solution to the rulefollowing problem. The skeptical solution denies the existence of "superlative" R-facts that would make statements of the form "P means R by '+' " true. The role of the sources for the meaning of `+' here is played by the patterns of solidarity behavior of members of some community to which P belongs. The correct use of '+' would be one that is approved by the competent majority of this community, and there can be no other sense in which it would be correct or wrong. Boyd's hypothesis denies the communal character of the '+' meaning. While there are no "superlative" R-facts, there should be C-facts not about the R as the standard that P or its community follows in their practice of using '+', but about whether they do it correctly. The proof of the Boyd hypothesis is based on the example of an imaginary Omega-community, whose agents use a finite set of simple symbols for the needs of their arithmetic: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'J'. Each symbol denotes a subset of identical, from the Omega-community point of view, numerical values. The symbol 'A' is used, for example, for a subset of the natural numbers 1, 10, 19, 28, 37, 46, etc.; 'B' for 2, 11, 20, 29, 38, 47, etc.; 'C' for 3, 12, 21, 30, 39, 48, etc. The Omega-community's arithmetic uses the only local function. whose range of values forms a finite set of mathematical propositions {a} that are true. The Omega-community's arithmetic, like our own, is open to many skeptical challenges. Is there a fact that determines the meaning of '.'? What do agents do when they calculate with '.' (say, solve examples 'A circle plus B = ?', 'C circle plus E=?', etc.)? Do they Add, Badd or Dadd? To answer them would require a "superlative" R-fact. For the calculation practice with 'circle plus', it could be a certain R-fact that determines the only possible order for the sequence of numerals 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'J' such that {a} is true. An analysis of the calculation practice using the local arithmetic function circle plus shows that for it there are no such R-facts that would determine the only correct standard R - even if the agents in the Omega-community were trained in such calculations on a full set of cases for the application of that function. However, for such practice there are C-facts (independent in their existence from R-facts) that make it possible to distinguish between what seems to be right and what is right. The solitary agent P and the Omega-community are in the same position regarding the knowledge of C-facts. The Omega-community's point of view has no advantage in matters of C-facts knowledge over the solitary agent P's point of view.

AB The article is based on the report "Postcoloniality: subject field, methodological foundations, social perspective" delivered at the seminar of the Center for Civilizational and Regional Studies of the Institute for African Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The article offers an analysis of the main aspects and trends of Postcoloniality as an interdisciplinary area of scientific research and as one of the "big challenges" of the contemporary world. The actuality of the problem is determined by the need to rethink the socio-cultural heritage of civilization, its current status and prospects. Coloniality continues to exist in the postcolonial world, but the struggle for political sovereignty is replaced by the sociocultural decolonization of people and communities. In the field of disciplined reflection, Postcoloniality is positioned as a complex area of research, an academic theory and a critical concept that claims to revise the Eurocentric discourse in the field of socio-humanitarian knowledge. Postcoloniality is also one of the characteristics of the emerging postmodern Universum. A large "homeless" nomadic community is emerging on the planet, which does not fit into the Procrustean bed of geographic localization and national statehood. Postmodernity, relying on creativity, experimenting with a variety of ways of self-organization and self-realization, finds itself in a symbiotic union with Postcoloniality. Today, turning the old encumbrances into a resource, the former inhabitants of the third world are mastering the planet, forming multi-vector coalitions in a constructive/destructive way. Having acquired a transcontinental subjectivity, they intercept the strategic initiative. Alfred Sauvy's vision of the role of the third world is coming true, the potency of which he compared seven decades ago to the transforming force that once sent the feudal-estate world order into the dustbin of history. The story of the "burden of the dark-skinned man", having passed in its "African aspect" by a long march along the steps of Pan-Africanism, negritude, the movement of "black panthers", Afrocentrism and BLM actionism in the entry way of the new century, has come close to the embodiment of the synthesis of Afropolitism, with Postmodernity scattered across the planet, strengthening solidarity positions of Modernity which decolonizes the integral Cosmopolitanism.

AB The article is dedicated to the prominent Russian scientist, ethnographer and historian Valentina Pavlovna Nevskaya (1919-2009), who received international recognition for the outstanding achievements in the development of the history of antiquity and world Caucasian studies. The biography of the scientist, which reflected many of the most important events of Soviet history (Civil War 1918-1922, economic experiments of the Bolsheviks of the 1920-1930s, the tragedy of the "great terror" policy of 1937-1938, mass repressions, the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945 years of the Cold War, etc.). The fate of Valentina Pavlovna was quite typical for the representatives of the Soviet intelligentsia: the choice of her major, as well as the choice of work, was determined by the status of "member of the family of the enemy of the people." Since ancient history was the least politicized branch of Soviet historical science, V.P. Nevskaya chose the history of Byzantium for her thesis topic. The book, written based on the aforementioned thesis, was translated into German and Japanese. The scientific studies conducted by V.P. Nevskaya, who left a big mark in the historical science of the North Caucasus (including taking part in a large-scale academic project of the Soviet era - "History of the peoples of the North Caucasus (end of XYIII in - 1917"). Nevskaya V.P. is the editor and author of the main overview works on history of particular areas and peoples of the region. Particular attention is paid to the works of a scientist on the history of Karachay-Cherkessia (from ancient times before the Bolsheviks came to power), in which, on the basis of numerous personally collected materials, including ethnographic and archaeological proof, the history of the region (population, social, family, land and legal relations, way of life, folklore, traditions, etc.) was recollected and restored. Valentina Nevskaya, having carefully studied the very complex social structure of the hereditary relations of the mountain peoples, came to the conclusion that these peoples were at the feudal stage of development, determining that at the turn of the XVIII - XIX centuries. These relations took place and were firmly fixed in the adatas, the customary law of the peoples of the North Caucasus. Particular attention in the writings of V.P. Nevskaya was given to the Karachais, a small Turkic people living high in the mountains of the Western Caucasus. After analyzing a large number of diverse sources, the researcher concluded that feudalism in Karachai developed directly from the general system, and land relations determined the nature of the relationship of Karachais with neighboring peoples, in particular, with Kabardians as a "militarypolitical confederation". Her experience teaching as a professor at the Stavropol State Pedagogical Institute (now the North Caucasus Federal University), where she headed the department of general history, is described. Valentina Nevskaya taught ancient history, continued her research on the history and ethnography of the North Caucasus and prepared a number of candidates of historical sciences. It is emphasized that the works of V.P. Nevskaya are currently important sources for writing dissertations, monographs, and articles on topical issues in the history of the North Caucasus. The texts of her books and articles testify to the highest level of professional skill, versatile erudition, the steady observance of ethical standards, and the awareness of the scientist's moral responsibility.

AB The questions of classification of political metaphors are considered. This classification is necessary for the analysis of the data of sociological survey, which was conducted by the team of Smolensk University in 2022 in regions of Russia. The study of the reputational image of power (respondents' answers to the questions: "How would you draw the reputational image of Russian / regional power?") problematizes the principles of classification. The relevance of the study in working out the diagnosis of the reputational image of power. The novelty of the study is that the analysis was conducted on the basis of folk metaphorization, rather than professional political discourse, which researchers of political metaphorology and political semantics usually deal with. The empirical material for the problematization of the classification was the results of the sociological survey 2021, which included similar questions. The classification of power metaphors on the basis of major philosophical categories and structural relationships (space/time; living/artificial; human/ nature/society) is presented, as such principle allows capturing the real diversity and multidimensionality of figurative likenesses proposed by respondents. The results of the study of folk metaphorization adjust the existing classifications of power metaphors, do not fully coincide with the known classifications of metaphorical models of power, also adjust the ideas about the popularity of typical metaphorical models.

AB The article analyzes the situation of the protection of historical and cultural heritage in the end of 1917 - beginning of 1918 in Petrograd. After the October Revolution Anatoly Lunacharsky (the people's commissar for education) decided to organize the central department for protection of historical and cultural heritage of Russia. This project was previously discussed by the Provisional Government. After the October Revolution it became even more current question. On the one hand it was the time of the building on completely new principles of state administration, and on the other, it was the time of general instability and in fact the outbreak of civil war. Responsibility for the safety of such artifacts (among them museum collections were the most important), which lay with the Bolsheviks, could be used as a weighty argument in the fight against numerous political opponents. It was in urgent need to take the preservation of cultural and historical monuments under centralized control. The foundation for such an organization was prepared by the Petrograd Artistic and Historical Commission, which began its activity in the period between the two revolutions of 1917. After the October Revolution, its members, realizing the importance of the tasks, refused to join the sabotage of the actions of the new government and continued to fulfill their duties. The authors analyze a number of archival documents, not previously considered by researchers in this perspective. These documents give reason to propose that Anatoly Lunacharsky planned to create the State Council for Arts under his own patronage in the period between January and February 1918. Also, he planned to transform the United Artistic and Historical Commission into the central executive body for protection of historical and cultural heritage. In fact, it should have been the ministry-equivalent organization. After the creation of the State Council for Arts this Commission should save its functions of the central executive institution. In this regard P. P. Veyner prepared a Note by the Anatoly Lunacharsky's request, the publication of the text of which is carried out by the authors for the first time.

DT Article
DE relativism; history; analytical philosophy; narrative; discourse
AB The subject of the article is the study of the foundations of historical relativism that arose during the "linguistic turn" in analytical philosophy. The aim is to try critically analyze three theoretical propositions:
   1. The prerequisites of historical relativism are already laid down in early analytical philosophy, in the criticism of the idea of universal history and universal methods of historical research;
   2. There is a rejection of the idea of description in favor of the idea of representation, and, as a result, a plurality of interpretations is postulated;
   3. The main theoretical achievement of historical relativism is the understanding of the historical narrative as a "story". A new discursive understanding of the language of historians is emerging in the analytical tradition.
   According to judgments of supporters of historical pluralism in analytical philosophy, there is a certain ontology of history, the essence of which boils down to the assumption of an ineradicable diversity of communities, epochs and cultural formations in the history of mankind. The following distinction can be proposed: unlike supporters of pluralism, historical relativists introduce into history the idea of the randomness of socio-cultural phenomena, which entails an apology for the multiplicity of interpretations. The historical world turns out to be random through the prism of a certain historical language devoid of essentialist patterns. The pluralism of interpretations corresponds to the random multiplicity of historical formations. The criteria for the truth and persuasiveness of the historical interpretation no longer relate to the objectivity of the described event, but to the plausibility of the proposed narrative. An increase in the number of historical interpretations will not give tangible progress in the study. The pluralistic position seems to be more constructive, since, avoiding universalism, it does not exaggerate the fabrication of interpretations. Relativism turns out to be a paradigm, not a theoretical attitude; it is a metaphysical position. If we present history in the form of stories, then this entails the transformation of the subject of history itself. The historian seeks not to recreate, but to organize the past in a discursive form within the framework of historical relativists. The object of history is thereby transformed: history is not a description of events in the past, but the construction of a discourse about historical experience.

AB The author conducts a systematic comparative analysis of the scientific worldviews and key research ideas of the American political anthropologist James Scott and the Russian agrarian economist Alexander Chayanov, to show their similar interests in the study of peasant revolutions, state systems, and anarchist ideas. Based on the identified similarities and differences in the milestones of their & nbsp;intellectual biographies, the author compares Scott & rsquo;s concept of the first ancient autarkic states with Chayanov & rsquo;s abstract economic-mathematical models of island-states. The article describes the contradictions and failures of modern projects for transforming the nature and society by state bureaucracies as revealed in the studies of Scott and Chayanov, and emphasizes the interest of both scholars in the potential of the anarchist epistemological and political ideas for the development of the scientific theory and political practice of interaction between society and the state. The author argues that Scott and Chayanov are not orthodox anarchists insisting on the complete disappearance of the state; they believe that the Leviathan statehood is impossible and, perhaps, not necessary to destroy. However, in their research, both Scott and Chayanov constantly raise questions about the ways to limit and weaken the power of the state bureaucracy with various forms of non-state public life associated with the anarchist ideas of self-organization, spontaneity, and freedom

DE linguistic turn; analytic philosophy; Richard Rorty
AB The idea of Richard Rorty's linguistic turn seems to be a good example to substantiate the point of view that the "philosopher's topos" should be determined not as event-related, but through their involvement in intellectual networks, through their connections and interactions with the scholarly community as a whole. That is, the place of a philosopher should be determined depending on how much their views, ideas, thoughts turned out to be influential, impressive, convincing, which would allow us to judge their "ideological platform", so to speak, ad hoc. In this sense, Rorty's linguistic turn may prove to be quite a noteworthy example. Fifty-five years after the publication of Rorty's famous anthology The Linguistic Turn: Essays in Philosophical Method (1967), we can confidently say that today there is no doubt that the idea of eliminating confusion and contradictions arising from our use of language has played and continues to play an important role for the philosophy of the 20th and 21st centuries. But what is of concern is that it is possible to successfully designate an entire movement with such a vague concept, firstly, because the term "linguistic turn" implies too many different methods, and, secondly, because many philosophers who consider themselves, for example, to belong to the analytic tradition, are unlikely to agree to consider this idea as a characteristic of their philosophical activity. Perhaps it is more correct to consider the idea of a linguistic turn as an important stage in the history of (analytic) philosophy, since today the analysis of language is only one of many tools available to modern philosophy. Anyway, the "linguistic turn" in Rorty's version turned out to be a very fruitful and inspiring idea, and not only for philosophy. What conclusion can be drawn from all this? The "philosopher's topos" should be considered, as it were, embedded in certain intellectual social networks. And it is this embeddedness that is an important prerequisite for the philosopher's intellectual success and reputation, and the condition for the recognition of the philosopher is participation, leading them, so to speak, to the "center of the network". Great thinkers do not appear from scratch, but as a result of the long and collective work of both predecessors and contemporaries. And Rorty's " fringe analytic philosophy" confirms this very convincingly.

AB In the post-pandemic years of 2021-2022, the post-Soviet space has entered a stage of decisive transformation, which will test the maturity of the state institutions formed 30 years ago for the region's countries. The study captures a snapshot of public sentiment in these countries on the eve of this wave of transformation - it is based on a series of large-scale opinion polls in Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan, conducted immediately after the last elections to the lower houses of the parliaments of these countries in the pre-crisis era. The main research question of the sociological study was to identify demographic and geo-graphical patterns in determining the attitude of voters toward the prospects for relations with Russia. Countries with traditionally different strategies of relations with Russia were taken: Belarus is a strategic ally, Kazakhstan is friendly but pursues a multi-vector policy, and Georgia is generally hostile at the level of the political class. The analysis showed that in matters of orientation towards positive relations with Russia, the voters of these countries nevertheless had more in common than differences. Based on the analysis results, several lines of delimitation can be distinguished. Firstly, the "macro-regional, geopolitical" line runs between Belarus and Kazakhstan, on the one hand, and Georgia, on the other. The second split along the "center-periphery" line takes place within states, i.e., Such a demarcation was singled out by many researchers, singled out concerning Russia; however, we found the same demarcations in Belarus ("Minsk and the rest of the country") partly in Georgia and Ka-zakhstan. Finally, the authors admit to it the possibility of delimitation along the north-south lines: in Georgia and, to some extent, in Kazakhstan, as a result of territorial differentiation in the residence of Russians in the northern regions of the republic, where sympathy for Russia is more clearly manifested than in the southern regions remote from it; and this demarcation is less pronounced in Belarus, where it refers to the regions bordering Russia and Ukraine.

AB The article is the second part of the work devoted to the period of political romanticism in the USSR in the third quarter of the XX century. A characteristic feature of this period is large-scale theoretical discussions around the concept of socialism and projects of socialist construction. The article examines the options for the non-economic interpretation of the Soviet experiment: the constructivist project of creating a "new man", "progressor", offered by G.P. Shchedrovitsky and the romantic dystopia of A. Zinoviev, who describes communism-socialism as a paradoxical mutation of the social order, which uses Western technology, but generally opposes civilization as such. It is shown that despite the historical defeat in the dispute with the "pragmatists", the "romantics" had a great influence on the collective cognitive structures of the Soviet society. The understanding of socialism they formed largely hindered the development of "compromise", hybrid political and economic programs and did not allow options for liberalization, privatization and movement along the so-called Chinese path.

AB Based on his own critical interpretation of the academic texts on different phenomena related to ethnic politics, the author discusses the basic criteria to define what is ethnic, as well as what are the nodal points of ethnicity and politics intersection. Working within the constructivist understanding of ethnicity as of a flexible and changing concept, the author concludes that it may not be confined to the cultural and linguistic distinctiveness. The proposed definition of an ethnic group is as follows: a social group that has distinct and broadly understood cultural features and an idea of hereditary membership. Based on the definition formulated above, the author proposes not to confine the research area of Ethnopolitical Studies to the interactions between a state and ethnic majorities or minorities, but to include populism (first and foremost, right-wing populism that the author deems synonymous to ethnopopulism) and nationalism (understood a priori as a product of ethnopolitical mobilization). Particular attention is paid to (ethno)regionalism that is a special, but very important, case of nationalism. The author underpins his conclusions by several examples from the West European politics. The author concludes that, on the basis of extremely inclusive constructivist definition of ethnicity, the research area of Ethnopolitical Studies may and should be understood as broad as possible, so as this discipline might strengthen its position in the ranks of social science subdisciplines, in particular, in the studies of the EU politics.

DE social action; intentionality; agency; event-causal approach; ontology
AB The article explores the problem of correlation between the concepts of social action arising in the framework of actor-network theory (ANT) developed by Bruno Latour and object-oriented ontology (OOO) developed by Graham Harman in the context of metaphysics of agency. At the first stage of the research, the ontological foundations of ANT and OOO are considered. Harman develops his concept as a theoretical extension of ANT by replacing the metaphysics of "relations" with a flat ontology of objects. For ANT, all objects are agents, since they appear only in action. For OOO, all agents are objects, since they are opaque and cannot be exhaustively described either by reduction to their components or by identification with their functions. But such an extension, while saving ANT from radical relativism, in turn, creates problems with the definition and classification of objects as agents. In the author's opinion, in this case, the choice of a description language should be justified not by setting ontological axioms (as Latour and Harman do), but by less abstract considerations about the explanatory power or the possibility of reducing one description language to another, in particular, as Donald Davidson does in the discussion about agentcausal and event-causal approaches to agency. He shows that the description of the action does not require the postulation of a separate entity of the agent, but can be produced using an event-causal scheme, in which the litmus test of the action is the presence of at least one description under an aspect that makes action intentional. This approach can be specified to describe a social action within ANT framework, for example, using the following criterion: an action is social action if there is a description under intentional aspect and if its result does not depend on the agent's intention. Such a criterion allows us to identify cases where the agent acts intentionally and the result of the action coincides with the intention, but this coincidence is accidental ("rainmaking ritual" has the intention to cause rain and may actually coincide with the event of rain). Within the framework of such a criterion, it is assumed that an action is recognized as social when it is intentional, and when its intentionality is not identical with the actual result of the action, since the result is partially or completely determined by the social structure, and the agent, according to Latour, never "acts alone."

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to identifying and interpreting the reasons and forms of protest activity of representatives of the youth cohort in the context of the institutionalization of modern digital society and digital policy. The common and specific features of the protest activity of Russian and foreign youth in the context of the content and level of their digital culture are characterized. The attention is focused on the dominant trends in the transformation of the practices of protest behavior in online and offline formats, taking into account the restrictive measures caused by the spread of COVID-19. Methods. The work was prepared within the framework of political science discourse using modern scientific theories and concepts. The authors rely on the main provisions of the activity-activist approach (A. Giddens, V. Yadov), the concept of "traumatic changes" (P. Sztompka) and "network society" (M. Castells). At the same time, the characterization of digital transformations and innovations (society, politics, culture) is carried out in the context of the ideas of "digital counterculture" (C. Gere), domestic researchers analyzing the consumer behavior of youth in the digital environment (T. Beregovskaya, S. Grishaeva). The work uses theoretical and empirical methods for analyzing the results obtained by leading domestic and foreign research centers, as well as with the direct participation of the authors in the implementation of grant activities. Results. An attempt is made to conduct political science analysis of the modern approaches to understanding the phenomenon of youth protest activity, its dominant forms in the context of the institutionalization of digital policy and the transformation of value orientations in the new structure of "digital culture". The relationship between the protest activity of representatives of domestic and foreign youth, the practices of their destructive/constructive protest behavior using digital technologies in order to legitimize/delegitimize the political regime is traced. Highlighted the real and potential resources of the authorities and administration, civil society institutions to minimize destructive factors that contribute to the strengthening of protest (civil, political, etc.) activity of various groups of young people in the context of the spread of the global pandemic. The results of theoretical and empirical studies that reveal the regional specifics of institutional forms of protest activity in modern Russia are interpreted. Discussion. The question of the forms and technologies of transformation of protest activity, taking into account the substantive characteristics of the digital culture of youth, its inclusion in the system for ensuring the stable and safe development of the Russian Federation, remains poorly studied. Authors' contributions. S.A. Pankratov developed the theoretical basis of the research and carried out the general scientific edition of the article. S.I. Morozov analyzed the dominant tendencies of youth protest activity. S.D. Gavrilov interpreted the results of theoretical and empirical studies characterizing the process of institutionalization of digital policy.

AB On July 8, 2022, former Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, who remained one of Japans most influential political leaders, was shot dead while participating in an election event. A month and a half before Abe's assassination, a round table was held on the legacy of Abe's cabinets with the participation of Russian Japanese studies scholars from several universities and research institutions in Russia and Japan. During the discussion, a comprehensive analysis of the foreign policy of Abe's cabinets and, above all, his diplomacy vis-a-vis Russia was given. Japan's military security policy underwent radical changes under Abe, with the concept of proactive pacifism being its ideological formalization. Among Abe's achievements in the domestic political sphere, the participants of the round table especially noted his ability to control the bureaucracy and use the slightest miscalculations of his political opponents, as well as skillful image-making and the use of slogans for propaganda purposes. It was stated that the policy of 'Abenomics', proclaimed by Abe, remains relevant today, although some of its intermediate goals have already been achieved. The set of measures carried out by Abe's cabinets and aimed at creating conditions for expanding women's participation in the economy, called Womenomics, was analyzed. In conclusion, the data of a survey of Japanese students focusing on the transformation of their views on the outcome of World War II under the influence of Abe's ideas are presented.

AB The authors investigate the issue of the interdependence of political institutions and economic growth rates in the post-crisis period of 2010-2018. The article presents an extensive review of scientific research on the impact of democratization on the development of different countries and identifies conceptual positions that create interdisciplinary discourse: democracy promotes growth, democracy does not promote growth, growth promotes democracy, growth does not promote democracy. The analysis of the interdependence of political institutions and economic growth was made based on the indicators of the 100 largest economies in the world in terms of GDP (PPP). To measure the quality of political institutions, the indicators of the country's average score in the Democracy Index (2010-2018) and the country's average position in the Corruption Perceptions Index are used. The country's economic growth rates are calculated as arithmetic mean indicators for 2010-2018 based on World Bank data. A comparative analysis of the variables shows that, in general, countries with low indicators of the quality of political institutions achieved economic growth rates above the world average, while countries with high quality political institutions suffer from slow development. The authors came to the conclusion that in the medium term, a high level of democratization of states does not lead to significant economic growth: full democracies contribute to consistently low rates of economic development, defective democracies are more predisposed to achieving economic growth, hybrid regimes are the most conducive to achieving high growth rates, authoritarian regimes have mixed effects on growth, but some are rapidly evolving. Democratization helps to increase the rate of economic growth to a certain level - the "turning point", which confirms the hypothesis of R. Barro. High levels of corruption are not an insurmountable obstacle to economic growth, which contradicts the generally accepted ideas about the unambiguously negative nature of this phenomenon. The research results contribute to the scientific discussion about the dependence of economic growth on the quality of institutions. The conclusions reveal a clash between the concepts of democratization based on liberal values on the one side and modernization, which is the effectiveness of economic growth and development, on the other.

DE Republic of Buryatia; social justice; income groups; social groups;
   social inequality
AB Based on the data of a sociological survey conducted in 2020-2021, the article analyzes the ideas of the residents of Buryatia about social justice. The authors have established that the problem of social justice is important for the vast majority of the respondents, who often face its reverse side - injustice. Rural residents with a low financial level and with debts often suffer from social injustice. The respondents consider income inequality and the system of distribution of property to be the most unfair in modern Russia. The authors have revealed that the content of the concept of social justice is connected, first of all, with equality before the law, equality of opportunities and leveling equality, and only secondarily with inequality - distributive and responsible. The analysis of empirical data has shown that the majority of the respondents demonstrate conservative views, associating social justice with a strong state, order and national interests, while the minority appeal to liberal values - democracy, solidarity, freedom. Moreover, the ideas of social justice differ somewhat among different income groups. The higher the income level, the more confident the representatives of this group are in choosing their estimates (as a rule, conservative ones), and vice versa: the lower the income, the more often respondents from low-income income groups find it difficult to answer and almost equally choose conservative and liberal values. The article concludes that social justice in the views of the respondents is not limited to financial issues: also important for them is inter-regional inequality associated with limited areas of residence and life opportunities for residents of the regions, benefits on the periphery of our country, which gives rise to their mass migration to other more prosperous regions of the Russian Federation. Therefore, serious state measures are needed to overcome inter-regional inequality and to ensure a balanced spatial and socioeconomic development of all regions of the country, which will help improve the level and quality of life of the population, improve their social well-being, and strengthen the foundations of social justice.

AB The article considers one of the main financial instruments of environmental security - environmental insurance. Attention is paid to the basics of development of this type of insurance in foreign jurisdictions, including the USA, China and European countries. In addition, the article examines in detail the Model Law on ecological insurance. The normative foundation of environmental insurance existing in Russia is reviewed: including Article 18 of Law No. 7-FZ, the Model Regulation on the procedure of voluntary environmental insurance in the Russian Federation, as well as federal laws providing for compulsory civil liability insurance for some objects related to the negative impact on the environment. The author also classified the acts containing the use of the term "environmental insurance" into acts specifically dedicated to environmental insurance; strategic and conceptual acts. Other acts indirectly affecting environmental insurance are analyzed. The conclusion about the necessity of adoption of the Federal Law of the Russian Federation "On ecological insurance", based on the concept of insurance of the risk of civil liability for harm caused to the environment and victims is made.

AB The article presents the results of the empirical study about the impact of the police suppression of street rallies on the political communication in social networks. Based on the messages published in the social network VKontakte during the discussion of a series of protests that took place in Moscow in the summer of 2019 on the eve of the City Duma elections, the author analyzes how police violence affects publishing activity on the Internet and the demand for the published content. The author reveals a positive relationship between the use of force by the police and the intensity of the discussion of the relevant event. According to his conclusion, the effect can be explained not only by a surge of interest in the protest events of a lesser scale, but also by the ability of motivated users to search and find an additional audience via the commenting mechanism. By communicating about what happened in the comments on neutral messages within the initially non-politicized communities, such users draw new people into the protest communication. In the event of a police crackdown, the number of comments that make up the most "democratic" part of the political communication in the new media, which is available even to users with low media capital, increases dramatically. The effectiveness of these comments is also increasing, in a sense that they are attracting new users into the discussion, which results in spreading the content to the pages, where protest actions are normally not discussed.

DT Article
DE European printing; Anton Koberger; pamphlet war; university libraries;

AB The article deals with complex processes which took place in Europe in the field of printing in early modern times. The author analyzes the situation in England and other states during the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. It is concluded that each European country has its own special features not only in the organization of the printing business itself, but also in the sphere of relations between government institutions and the publishing community. The history of publishing in England very clearly shows how the printed book influenced not only the spiritual, but also the political processes that took place in the country over several centuries. In connection with the study of the traditions of British printing and the reading circle of the educated Englishman of the Early Modern Age, the most important source for us is the manuscript catalog of the Fairfax family library, kept in the Archive of the St. Petersburg Institute of History. English intellectuals Fairfax stood out primarily as the owners of the largest private book collection in England in the 17th century. And their library was, strictly speaking, a certain attribute of political elitism. Wallenrodts, who belonged to the Prussian nobility of the Brandenburg principality, proceeded from the idea of the social significance of their own book collection, and already during Ernst von Wallenrodt's lifetime bequeathed the collection to the University of Konigsberg. The author comes to the conclusion about the important role of the national press, acting as a consolidating ethnopolitical element in the course of such a formation of a new configuration of states of the Westphalian political system.

AB The article is devoted to the transformation of Soviet medical science and practice under theconditions of the development of international relations after World War II. The main attention wasplaced on the study of scientific and social medical projects, which were implemented by the USSRduring the Cold War under the influence of foreign policy trends and priorities. The analysis offoreign, Soviet and Russian historiography shows that researchers have made serious progress in thestudy of medicine in the sphere of international relations. At the same time, the Soviet medicalglobal project has not been sufficiently examined, which is due both to the source base and to thelack of a sociopolitical context in these works. The main documents for this article are recentlydeclassified materials held in the fonds of the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History, theRussian State Archive of Social and Political History, the State Archive of the Russian Federation,and the Russian State Archive of Economics. The authors analyze the development of Sovietmedical projects during the period of "late" Stalinism, in the 1950s and 1960s, and in the 1970s. Theauthors conclude that the Soviet global medical project constantly sought to expand. Thus, the firstpostwar years provided the foundations for the sustainability of the Soviet project within thesocialist bloc, in the 1960s it would begin to spread to the Third World, and in the 1970s it wouldcompete in the leading countries of the world. An important component of the Soviet medicalproject was the fight against epidemic and infectious diseases in post-colonial countries, theprevention of socially significant diseases and non-communicable diseases, as well as intensivescientific-medical and medical-technical exchanges through bilateral and multilateral partnerships.The Soviet medical project made possible not only competition between the two superpowers, butalso cooperation in such important areas as the fight against smallpox or cooperation in shaping theinternational public dialogue on denuclearization. In general, the authors believe that an analysis ofSoviet medicine during the Cold War allows us to show its role in the Soviet geopolitical construct, thus evaluating its ideological and applied components

AB The subject of discussion is the phenomenological typology of practically implemented municipal management strategies, as well as the influence of external factors on the preference of a certain type of strategy. The research hypothesis assumes that the choice and preference of a certain management strategy depends on external non-political factors. Using a qualitative methodology (direct observation and in-deep interviews) the materials of several hundred field studies of the municipal government experience in provincial local communities in 2006-2021 were summarized. We have previously described four extreme cases of management strategies: (1) real local self-government; (2) "landlord" management; (3) "Soviet-type" governance; (4) "politicized" governance. The used management strategies remain unchanged in municipalities for a long time. The preference for a certain strategy is mainly due to several factors. Those are (1) spatial isolation of the local society, (2) the length of community's live, (3) possibilities for the population to use local natural resources and ownerless property, (4) the ability to resources' control by representatives of local authorities, (5) dependence of the municipality on external state financial and economic support. The revealed non-political factors have predictive value for the governmental administration from the point of view of the local level of public authority.

DE Prishvin; Bukharin; Stalin; Dostoevsky; Bolshevism; literature
AB The ideological and political context of M. Prishvin's views on the life of Soviet society and his assessment of the activities of N. I. Bukharin after the October Revolution are studied. The study of Prishvin's diary works will contribute to an unbiased and objective idea of the writer's ideological position and of his artistic heritage as a whole. It is shown how, in the course of applying the artistic images and ideas of F. M. Dostoevsky to the analysis of the leaders of Bolshevism activities and destinies, Prishvin comes to the conclusion that the organizers and inspirers of social violence against people will inevitably die, becoming victims of their own destructive ideas. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the 18-volume "Diary" of the writer, previously unpublished due to censorship restrictions, which became available to readers only in the post-Soviet period. It is shown that the fanaticism of serving the idea of the class struggle gives rise to the moral inferiority of the party-state elite, from whose midst come Stalin's rivals - "pretenders for power". For the first time in Prishvin studies, an attempt was made to show how, using the example of the fate of Bukharin, a typical representative of the Bolshevik-Leninists, the writer reveals not only the tragic inconsistency of his beliefs, but also draws historiosophical conclusions about the internal flaws of the revolutionary ideology.

SO IMAGOLOGIYA I KOMPARATIVISTIKA-IMAGOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian emigration; first wave; Eurasianism; philosophy of Motherland;
   philosophy of Fatherland; ideology
AB The article is dedicated to one of the basic ideas of the philosophic movement of Eurasianism - the idea of the Motherland. Unlike the other philosophical trends of the first wave of emigration, Eurasians were the only ones who understood the Fatherland not speculatively, but geographically. Eurasians could be called the first political scientists of the Russian philosophical tradition: they tried to predict the political situation in the abandoned Russia in order to build a new state on the ruins of Bolshevism in the future. They formed the concept of the Motherland from four components: a historically formed territory, power for possession of the territory, religion (Orthodoxy), and culture (common for the entire middle Eurasia, which was yet to be created on the basis of Russian culture). The author of the article insists on the fact that the idea of a common culture was reduced to declarations and was not developed by the participants in the movement. Besides, the theme of culture exposes some structural contradictions in the Eurasian theory (it contradicts the anti-colonial pathos of some works and looks retrograde against the background of innovative political forecasts). Eurasians' religious themes were also poorly developed, some participants in the movement even ignored the subject. Detailed historical, economic, and national issues did not remove the general "narrowness" of the theory: the Motherland was uniquely defined only as mestorazvitie [local development] (P.N. Savitsky's term), which created a contradiction Eurasians did not feel: in the domestic policy, in modem terms, they were globalists who insisted on the victory of the centripetal forces in the "Ocean of Eurasia"; in the foreign policy, they were anti-globalists who seriously believed that a closed (but large) economic system is more efficient than a global one. This contradiction brings us to the main semantic gap of the Eurasian theory: all the creators of this doctrine refused to understand that, for the "middle lands" of Eurasia, Russian culture and the Russian language, in one way or another, represented the language and culture of the colonialists. They simply did not see this significant problem, looking at Eurasia with Russian eyes and insisting that the Russian people in Eurasia were then "the first among equals". In addition, the concept of mestorazvitie created a negative assessment for all who had dropped out of their own "local development" Emigration, thus, became the periphery of the Russian and Eurasian idea, meaningless from the point of view of the processes taking place in the Motherland. For this reason, in the author's opinion, Eurasianism was doomed to an early decline: the ideas of Eurasianism lost their vitality as soon as the emigration realized (in the late 1920s - early 1930s) that there was no way back to Russia.

AB The article analyzes several historical narratives used for forming national identity among the young generation of Russia. The authors consider the most essential mental historical constructions mentioned in the current educational programs. These constructions are supposed to make the basis for the cultural memory of the Russian society and to form the image of the past epochs at a group level. The research work is based on qualitative methodology using methods of focus-groups and thematically-centered interviews. The selection was done by the "snowball" method. The analytical data present the results based on the material collected in four focus-groups and 40 thematically-focused interviews conducted in groups of secondary school teachers and 10- and 11-graders. The authors emphasize the existence in educational programs of alternative approaches to the split of the Russian Empire and historical heroes of that epoch, which focus on the lack of analytical frameworks for "remembering" and present historical narratives. The young generation do not perceive all the complexity of evaluations in the historical perspective of their own country and tend to accept any suggested context. In this respect, the common nature of identity, its essential grounds are beyond the logical understanding and may be shortly and easily formed (destroyed) among the young with regards to the necessary concept. The authors conclude that the concept of the Russian identity does not gain sufficient historical continuity and does not propose a scheme for analyzing historical transformations enabling young people to get a conciliatory view of social and political gaps of the past epochs.

AB The article reconstructs the integral structure of educational activity that ensures students' self-determination as a conscious construction by students of an image of their own future and a strategy for its implementation based on reflection and transformation of cultural material. This work is based on the analysis and comparison of two educational approaches that actually position self-determination as a basic process and at the same time a result of educational activity: the system of views of P.G. Shchedrovitsky on the proper organization of the educational process that is outlined in his recent book Criticism of Pedagogical Reason and didactics of open education, offering specific ways of organizing self-determination. Shchedrovitsky's model of self-determination includes the following components: (a) personal attitude to specific cultural phenomena (up to the formed position); (b) reflexive-analytical transformation of these phenomena, during which different levels of thinking are formed, as well as the ability to understand - recreate - the basic structures of reality and determine them as factors of their own activity. The didactics of open education describes specific technologies of self-determination, similarly based on reflection and transformation of sociocultural material. It is based on the following provisions: (a) the starting element of the process of self-determination is an educational task that turns any cultural material into either a subject or a tool for practical action; (b) the central point of self-determination is the development of a complex sociocultural object as an ideal entity that normalizes and organizes large units of human activity; (c) the result of self-determination is a holistic practice that ensures the implementation of the mastered ontological principles in a specific situation; (d) the key factor of self-determination becomes a specially organized reflection of cultural material, which occurs in the mode of a step-bystep "removal" of social structures that formalize it: norms of behavior, methods of activity, sociocultural imperatives. The approaches under consideration can be considered only variations within a single system of substantive grounds. In this regard, they allow us to clarify the key provisions of each other. Shchedrovitsky's approach sets the basic conceptual logic of self-determination in education; the approach of didactics of open education provides its structure and technologies.

DE sociology of art; event research; intentional analysis
AB The article evaluates the experience of using two relatively new methods for modern sociology of art. The need for such a perspective can be explained by the increasing competition between the sociology of art and empirical aesthetics. In such a situation, the review of new strategies in modern art research opens up prospects for their widespread use at the sectoral and interdisciplinary levels. The article discusses event analysis and intentional analysis. The first method allows us to consider art as a set of events (event analysis): it is not the traditional approach to the study of art that is taken into account (for example, the identification of the ideological and artistic or stylistic originality of a work of art), but the demand among recipients, involvement in megaprojects, exhibitions, the creation of sociopolitical connotations, etc. At the same time, events related to art unfold in museums, galleries, on the streets in public places, during other events. The second method is adopted from philosophical phenomenology (Husserl, Brentano) and is a measurement of the moods of society that arise and change from contact with art. At the same time, the key point is the evaluation of the role of art in achieving certain goals - social, political, economic. Compared with traditional methods used in the relevant branch of sociology, these research directions allow us to consider art and its forms as an "empirical field" in which a special role is assigned to the researcher and recipients (informants), and art is regarded as a "standard" object for research along with others. This is how the so-called context is formed - the " new" sociology of art, which is forced to compete with empirical aesthetics, the subject field of which is not the beautiful as the most important criterion for the existence of art, but society, which is able to form the status of the beautiful in art itself due to ideological, religious and other mechanisms.

DE David Graeber; the value of work; the transformation of work; useless

ID LABOR
AB David Graeber (1961-2020) presented his concept of rethinking the role of work in hu-man life and society. In science, the concepts of work are polarized with the predomi-nance of socio-economic views. The relevance of the researcher's approach is due tothefact that he offers a value-semantic interpretation of the civilizational development ofwork, taking into account the changes of man and societies. The article gives an assess-ment of his social theory of work. Graeber devoted many of his books and articles to thisphenomenon of human individual and collective life activity, in which he considers workand professions as useless for society and the individual himself, because they act only asa set of actions subordinate to some social force. An analysis of his views reveals severalimportant areas within Graeber's conception: 1) rethinking the role of work in human lifeand societies is possible on the basis of changes not only of an economic nature, but alsoon the basis of stratificational and socio-political changes; 2) work symbolizes the pay-ment by humanity of ephemeral debts accumulated over the course of civilizational de-velopment; 3) the bureaucratization of work increases its uselessness and limits the social will of the individual in the exercise of work functions and professional competencies.These features can be considered fundamental in understanding the thinker's theory, sincethrough all his works there is a refrain about the need to rethink key social values (work,money, finance, taxes, resources and others), the nature of which is determined not onlyby economic relations, but also by value-semantic ones. Thus, it is concluded that Grae-ber's contribution to modern knowledge consists in his proposed new coordinate systemfor revaluing the role of work and labor relations in human existence

DE political culture; municipal service; municipal employee
AB The article reveals the role of political culture in the activities of municipal employees in Russia. The work is based on an empirical study; its participants were candidates for positions in the municipal service, and then the same respondents, but already in the status of municipal employees with at least one year of experience. The main aim of the study was to identify various aspects of understanding political culture, its relationship with the value orientations of individuals, as well as to determine the importance of political culture for decision-making and in general attitude to business. Changes in the ideals of political culture that emerged among the candidates, and then were subjected to consensus when obtaining certain experience of municipal service, were also traced. The idealization of political culture, as the article shows, is associated with the worldview and value orientations of individuals focused on working in municipal bodies. Over time, having sufficient experience of municipal service, the study participants resort to a consensus regarding the role of political culture in their professional activities. As a result of this consensus, some characteristics and ideals of political culture do not change, but at the same time there are illustrative examples of critical views on political culture. The identification of the ideals of political culture makes it possible to assess individuals' attitude to this phenomenon, and these ideals become important for the development of certain views, ideas and opinions. Thus, in the article, political culture is conceptualized as a factor of effective municipal service and as consolidation of officials' value orientations correlated with political culture.

DE morality; ethics; impartiality; partiality; special permissions and
   obligations
AB One of the main focal points of the recent discussion on the possibility to justify moral partiality (special permissions and obligations) is the phenomenological objection. Simon Keller transformed it from the objection against the inference of special permissions and obligations from the impartial treatment of all persons into the touchstone for every justification of moral partiality. In his opinion, the projects view and the relationships view also do not pass this test. An agent who contributes to the well-being of her nearest and dearest does not do it because she is afraid to lose the possibility to fulfill her personal project or to maintain her relationships with a particular person. She does it immediately for the sake of her nearest and dearest. This is the basis of Keller's own justification - the individuals view. Though this attempt to avoid the phenomenological objection is not impeccable. To retain the tie of the individuals view with impartiality, Keller considers close relationships between individuals not a moral reason but an enabler of moral reasons. This position gives rise to substantial contradictions. Some supporters of the individuals view try to smooth them out through giving close relationships a status of an intensifier of moral reasons. Their answer to the phenomenological objection is following: the motives of moral agents should include only reasons to act, but not every factor that changes the deontic status of an action. So the fact that relationships intensify moral reasons and the fact that the cause of this intensification is that relationships contribute to agent's good life can be rightfully absent from her consciousnesses. There is a serious problem with this argument. The reason of partiality in the modified individuals view is an equal value of every person intensified in the case of someone nearest and dearest. If only reasons should be present in the consciousnesses of an agent, then special permissions and obligations turn out to be unjustified. If, on the contrary, her motives should reflect all the process of intensification, then she becomes a person who acts to contribute to her good life. According to the phenomenological objection, it is a wrong reason. The other way to avoid the objection relies on the unity of interests of an agent and her nearest and dearest. It is also vulnerable. So for now the phenomenological objection to justifications of moral partiality creates a complete theoretical impasse.

DE survival values; traditional medicine; narrative identity
AB This article explores the importance given to children's fear and the rules and customs around it in Armenian society. The study is based on a narrative analysis of interviews which allowed identifying the reasons why parents make a decision about the need for a healing practice to relieve fear. Also, based on interview analysis, the reactions of the informants who recalled their experience of visiting a healer in their childhood have been collected. Recalling their childhood experience, the informants re-construct their identity and oppose themselves to the cultural tradition that is accepted in Armenia and that made it possible to conduct a healing ritual. One of the forms of healing practices in Armenia is the practice of "removing fear", which is often mentioned by the informants. The research literature states that the significance of fear is constantly shaped by cultural and historical factors. There is some cultural "prescription" indicating how to act in the face of danger. The cultural script adopted in Armenia encourages parents to turn to healers with a request to remove fear. So, fear is a social construct of society and tradition. Culture and tradition in society indicate us what we should fear. Based on the interviews, the author highlights the main motives for parents to decide to work with children's fears by healing. However, it can be seen from the interviews that quite often children do not have a request to be taken to remove their fear(s) or they are too small and cannot articulate the request by themselves. Parents interpret the child's behavior themselves as the presence of a fear and decide that this fear needs to be "removed" because otherwise it can cause serious problems with health. "Problems" means both psychological and physiological diseases, because it is believed that fear destroys the body. Thus, parents try to prevent more serious consequences. This study suggests that the significance given to childhood fear is constructed by tradition. The social construction of fear is influenced by survival values and traditional values, as well as the belief that fear puts the child at risk for a dangerous disease.

AB The questions of relationship of Islam and France, of integration of Muslims into French society have produced an abundant scholarship by historians, political researchers, and sociologists due to its relevance. The new book by Ian Coller is dedicated to the history of the attitude towards Islam and Muslims, to its politicization and use in the period of the French Revolution. This perceptive provides a fresh look at the very revolutionary ideas and changes that took place in France and to the Revolution itself. The book is about the history of people and about the history of ideas in their inevitable relationship. It shows how for a short period during French Revolution emerged an opportunity for building another relationship between Europeans and Muslims rather than a confrontation. During the revolution, Muslims received all political and civil rights, but after Thermidor and with the Napoleon Bonaparte's coming to power, the politics towards Islam and Muslims was completely changed.

AB The paper deals with the emergence of the conservative patriotic myth issue in Austria between 1805 and 1819. During this period, the Austrian Empire went through transformation from reformist discussions to establishing the conservative political system by the chancellor Metternich. The patriotism of that time was based on the ideas presented by Friedrich von Gentz, Joseph von Hormayr, and Adam Muller. They justified the common identity for Habsburg subjects in philosophical, historical and political senses, regardless of their ethnic and language back-grounds. The purpose of a new myth was to support loyalty to the ruling dynasty during the Napoleonic wars and to create a conservative political course. The purpose of the paper is to analyze the core elements of the conservative patriotic myth in Habsburg monarchy presented in the works by Friedrich von Gentz, Joseph von Hormayr and Adam Muller published between 1805 and 1819. The ideas of those intellectuals effected the change of political course and foreign policy of the Austrian Empire. After the downfall of Napoleon, the ideas of all three intellectuals became a justification for the Metternich course in Austria. The complex of narratives, texts and ideas with social function had a deep impact on the political development of Austria, the political culture of Austrian Germans and non-Germanic peoples of the Empire until its collapse. It had a correlation with Romanticism in public opinion and repressions against anti-monarchist and nationalist movements. It also became a basis for Austrian conservatism as a political ideology.

   differentiation of passenger traffic density; connectivity
AB The global community formation is based on the air service development. The passenger traffic growth makes space and time smaller, increases interconnection and interdependence both within individual countries and around the world, and promotes integration. The passenger traffic volume was steadily growing in all countries worldwide at the beginning of the 21st century. At the same time, the airspace is becoming more and more international. The former absolute predominance of Western countries in the air passenger transportation has irreversibly become a thing of the past, and the positions of developing countries, especially Asian ones, are rapidly strengthening. The United States and China are the two world leaders in terms of air passenger traffic these days. Russia's position in the global air space is not strong enough, despite the passenger traffic growth after 2000. Russia has not yet reached the level of 1990. The things get worse due to the decline of railway passenger carriages, first of all, by a serious lag in the high-speed railways development. Air passenger traffic in Russia is characterized by a high level of territorial differentiation, since it is largely concentrated in the Moscow and partly St. Petersburg aviation hubs. This means that access to airline services is difficult for people of most regions of Russia. Russia significantly exceeds the level of the United States, China, and any other major countries of the world in terms of territorial differentiation of passenger traffic density. As to aviation connectivity, Russia is inferior to all major countries of the world - passenger traffic does not integrate its territory intensively enough. Given the continuous connectivity growth of all other countries of the world, the low level of connectivity of Russia may create problems for the integrity of the country in the future. The reasons for the insufficiently high density of passenger traffic, its high territorial differentiation, and low connectivity in Russia are the degradation of the national division of labor due to the decline of high-tech and knowledge-intensive industries, as well as the low income of the majority of the people.

AB The First and the Second World Wars are among the most important events in the world history of the XX century. They have largely influenced the development of mankind, and modern society is largely formed under their powerful impact. At the same time, the concept of world wars is still insufficiently developed in the social sciences. This has led to a number of challenges to this concept, which propose to expand the scope of the notion of " world war", including, in particular, the major wars of the New Age and the Cold War. In addition, the view that the totality of the wars of the late 20th and early 21st centuries constitutes the Third World War has become widespread these days. Furthermore, in the social sciences, substitutes for the concept of "world war" are used more and more frequently. These are notions that replace the idea of world wars, partly coinciding with it in scope ("general war" by A. Toynbee, "global war" by G. Modelski, etc.). In order to identify the specifics of world wars, distinguishing them from other major wars, the author proposes to single out their formal and real criteria. As formal criteria for world wars, the author considers the following factors: 1) the direct participation of the armed forces of most of the leading states of the world, 2) the participation of blocs of states on both sides, 3) the deployment of military operations on the territory of at least two continents and in the World Ocean connecting them, and finally 4) simultaneity of clashes in the main centers of war. Establishing real criteria involves identifying the causes of world wars. The author connects the world wars with monopoly capitalism, which arose at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. Monopoly capitalism is moving from a transnational to a global phase, which leads to the transformation of the causes of world wars. From the point of view of the unity of formal and real criteria, we can confidently assert that only the war of 1914-1918 and the war of 1939-1945 really were the world wars. Identification of the evolution of the causes of world wars allows us to discuss the possibility of the Third World War in the 21st century.

AB In historiography, there is no holistic study of the history of the concepts of "patriot" and "patriotism" both in Britain and in Russia, just as there is no comparative historical study using a fairly wide range of sources. This article, of course, does not set the task of a full-scale study of the "patriotic" discourse, and even only the concepts of patriot and patriotism in the two countries over a century and a half. Here we present in a concentrated form the results of a comparison of specific versions of the use of data and similar concepts in qualitatively different socio-political contexts, with an attempt to identify the presence of common meanings behind obvious features. We are talking, on the one hand, about the deeply rooted components of the ideological and cultural heritage, and on the other hand, about the real fruits of intellectual transfer.

This article continues the discussion. The author pays significant attention to Rorty's re-description of philosophy as the "conversation of humankind" and proposes various possible contexts for understanding the metaphor "conversation of humankind" based on Rorty's Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity. Also, the author touches upon the possible consequences for political theory from the redescription of philosophy as a "conversation of humankind" and from Rorty's peculiar understanding of the liberal project.

   technologies; digital technologies; Big Tech; censorship; digital
   control; digital dictatorship; digitalization of politics
AB The article investigates the fate of Freedom of Speech, one of the basic democratic values, amid the monopolization of the digital market and information space by large IT companies (the Big Tech "digital dictatorship"). The author relates the history of the Freedom of Speech principle, considers its connection with the new category of "informational freedom", touches upon the term "informational violence" (which includes censorship). An important aspect of Freedom of Speech is its relative character, as it must not infringe on other agents' rights or lead to state (social) security concerns. This provides a great opportunity for various interpretations and hence manipulations of this principle. Under conditions of "digital dictatorship", Freedom of Speech appears to be limited by censorship on the part of the digital market owners who veil their political bias by worshiping the ideals of democracy. A detailed analysis of IT giants' activities in the digital market reveals their monopolistic nature, which has economic, legal and socio-political consequences: the digital market submission to the terms set by the dominant companies, the violation of personal data confidentiality laws, the restriction of democratic rights and freedoms (primarily, the right to privacy and the Freedom of Speech). The antitrust campaign against four of the five Big Tech companies launched by the U.S. Congress in 2019, has not been successful. Regarding rights and freedoms violation, the IT giants also remain elusive, given the lack of effective legal practices for the settlement of such conflicts in information space. The situation is worsened by the politics of digitalization itself, which delivers additional controls to the monopolists. Having taken on the roles of censors, law-makers (defining the terms of service) and even policemen (blocking and deleting accounts in social networks), the Big Tech bunch has become a self-sufficient political actor. From a geopolitical perspective, the competitive struggle also takes place in the digital technologies arena, which complicates the maintenance of states' political independence from the digital monopolists. All this creates conditions for an unlimited "digital dictatorship" of the big IT companies against untrusted users and even states.

AB The article is based on the data collected in the study of the Russian power reputation space. The study focused on both the Russian power in general (official state and municipal power) and the regional power including the state executive power of the region. The authors defined several levels (federal/regional/municipal) and branches (legislative/executive/judicial) of power as the coordinate system structuring the space of power; and for the regional executive power, also peculiarities of responsibilities carried by the subjects of power. The study aimed at identifying the core and periphery of the reputation space of the Russian power based on the results of the two-stage sociological study - expert assessments and mass survey. The authors argue that the reputation space of both the Russian power in general and the regional power is multi-component and formed by the reputation of different subjects of power with a high degree of mutual influence. The study revealed a significant difference in the definitions of the core of the reputation space by the population and experts. The federal power constitutes the core of the reputation space of the Russian power as structured by its levels, according to experts and public opinion. Experts believe that the executive branch constitutes the core of the reputation space as structured by its branches, while the influence of the reputation of different branches seems balanced for public opinion. The similar situation was identified in the reputation space of the regional power. The authors also identified the significant influence of the personification factor on the reputation space of both the Russian power in general and the regional authorities. This leads to a 'shift' of the reputational core, which becomes especially evident in public opinion on the role of the president's reputation: every third respondent identifies it with the reputation of the entire Russian power.

AB The conflict with the appointment of an interim leadership at the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences is seen as both situational and systemic. The problem corresponds to the main topics of the author's research: 1) modern and postmodern; 2) general theory of ideology and analysis of specific ideological processes; 3) problems of intellectual, political and institutional freedom. Attempts to discredit the activities of the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences in terms of format and style fit, on the one hand, into the traditions of the well-known "doctors' plot", and on the other hand, into the experience of the latest extreme postmodernism with its most open eclecticism and disconnection from external reference. At the same time, there is an implicit attitude towards ideology not as a system of ideas, but as a system of institutions. This allows us to talk about analogies with the practice of raider capture. Philosophy is considered as a self-sufficient and at the same time practically oriented type of intellectual activity. This self-sufficiency brings it closer to art, in which, starting from a certain level of masterpieces and geniuses, general value hierarchical comparisons are considered not quite correct.

DE Empedocles; charlatanism; alazon; rhetoric; parrhesia; breathing

AB This article revises the views about Empedocles of Akragas. Even contemporaries of the thinker were confronted with the question of whether he was a great sage or a charlatan. The combination of "scientific" and prophetic knowledge embarrassed more than one generation of researchers, making them accuse Empedocles of superficial eclecticism or see him as an inconsistent representative of antique mechanical philosophy. With no intention to give a final answer to this question, the article suggests looking at this problem from a different angle by focusing more on the lifestyle of Empedocles and less on his theoretical provisions of philosophy. The first part of the article provides a brief outline of the history of the concept of "charlatanism" and considers the image of Empedocles as a Greek alazon. The internal motives of the political and public activity of Akragas accompanied by provocative behavior and claims to divine status are considered. It is suggested that the personality conflict of Empedocles, the discrepancy of external appearance and acts, is primarily due to pedagogical purposes and desire to deliver saving truths to his contemporaries who were mired in vices. The second part of the article deals with a hypothesis about breathing exercises of Empedocles. The main attention is paid to the 129 B (DK) and 100 B (DK) fragments, with an attempt to reconstruct the breathing practice of Empedocles as a thought technique aimed at gaining access to higher knowledge.

AB A review of an edition of the diary of a prominent figure in the Vilna (Vilnius) cooperative Alexander Szklennik, which he began keeping a few months before the German occupation of the city and before the November Revolution in Germany. The manuscript of the diary was donated 15 years after the author's death by his relatives to the Vilna Association of Friends of Science. Its publication was carried out by Dr Joanna Gierowska-Kallaur. The published diary is the only such comprehensive and stunningly accurate picture at the disposal of historians of everyday life in Vilna during the German occupation. The picture of the real situation in Vilna and the Vilna region in 1915-1918 remained unclear for a long time, due to the one-sidedness of Polish historiography, the influence of German and Lithuanian historical politics and the myth of the foundation of the Belarusian People's Republic. For Polish historiography, the most significant factor limiting the possibility of a reliable historical analysis of the situation in Vilna was the lack of access for Polish historians to the sources remaining in << archival dispersal >> outside Poland. The diary's text, replete with details of everyday life in the city and descriptions of political disagreements between the national communities (Poles, Lithuanians, Belarusians and Jews), makes it possible to recreate a comprehensive picture of life in the city during the occupation period.

DE digital society; civilizational transition; social inequality; digital

AB The article is devoted to the review of the main economic, so-cial, political and cultural problems and contradictions that arise in the pro-cess of the transition to a digital society. According to the author, this transi-tion is civilizational in nature, affecting not only economy and social relations, but also the way of life, the system of values and the worldview of most inhab-itants of the planet.The article shows that, as in any other transitional era, in the modern terms, new problems are intertwined with the old ones, strengthening con-flicts in the society and engendering uncertainty about the future. The econ-omy of the "capitalism of digital platforms" is much more monopolized than the capitalist economy of the 20th century. Digital monopolies are becoming real competitors of governments, and it is highly plausible that the struggle for power between them will ultimately result in the merge of the power of the state with the economic and intellectual potential of digital giants and the for-mation of a new version of the state-monopoly capitalism. Coupled with the increasing income gap, digital inequality expands the abyss between the rich and the poor and contributes to the formation of the pyramidal structure of society, where the place in the social hierarchy is determined by the possibil-ity of creating, using and commercializing modern information and commu-nication technologies. The fundamental changes in the labor market due to robotization and the expanding use of artificial intelligence carry the threat of the appearance of a huge layer of "non-demanded people". This means that, unlike most societal models that existed in the 20th century, the digital soci-ety will not be inclusive, which, in turn, will affect its stability. The looming transformation of the consumption society into the entertainment society will also have serious implications. The processes associated with this transforma-tion are fraught with the cultural retrogression of mankind and jeopardize the foundations of the human civilization in the form that took several millennia to develop.

AB Being a supporter of the "Logic of Smysl" approach (LS), the author is highlighting four its main aspects in assurance that they can increase the number of such supporters. First, it responds to the searches being carried out in European culture and to serious and multi-faceted criticism of academic philosophy. So, it has the potential to overcome this crisis on the path to discovering Smysl as a real "thing" (res), as well as to overcome the notori-ous and bored dichotomy of analytical and hermeneutic approaches. Secondly, the philos-ophy proceeding from the LS starts from the very beginnings of thinking, from the meta-physical idea of Wholeness-Smysl, comes to socio-political implications, thus following the Russian traditions of integral, whole knowledge. Thirdly, LS, preserving the problem of consciousness as a problem, fundamental and peculiar to modernity, can become a complex of new researches, leading cognitive science to the study of other ways of thinking of the world. Fourthly, the author sees in LS an ethical project: as a goal it is reviving and re-interpreting the well-known Russian philosophy ideal of all-humanity, taking into account the real otherness of the Other and using the material of philosophical Oriental studies - it is the ideal of friendship and brotherhood.

AB Ivan Yakovlevich Korostovetz (1862-1933) was one of the most prominent Russian diplomats of the late 19(th) and early 20(th) centuries. He played an extremely important role in the developing Russian-Chinese relations and a no less significant part in the development of Russian-Mongolian ties. Not a sinologist by education, and at the start not speaking Chinese, Korostovetz could understand the specifics of China so deeply and delve into the peculiarities of Chinese realities that he became one of the best experts on China at that time. Korostovetz actively popularized his knowledge on China among the Russian public by writing books and articles about the country. At the turn of the 20(th) century, Korostovetz became one of the most capable diplomats in the Russian Empire and contributed to an active Russian policy in China and Outer Mongolia. Having a deep understanding of the Russian geopolitical interests in the Far East, he was able to clearly formulate the main goals of Russia's policy in this region at the time when the Xinhai revolution broke out in China. Unfortunately, after 1917, Korostovetz failed to find a place for himself in the diplomatic field, and so he became the author of many published and unpublished works on the history of diplomacy and international relations in the Far East. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of Korostovetz' activities in various diplomatic positions in China and evaluate his role in the development of Russian-Chinese relations, as well as analyze his articles and books about China and show the depth in which he understood political development, history and culture of this country.

DT Article
DE USSR; Great Patriotic War; state security agencies; youth; underground
AB The article introduces unique documents about the security agencies of the USSR into academic circulation. An analysis of these documents and literature enables the author to make new claims about the traditional dual attitude of the Stalinist state towards young people. On the one hand, young people made a large contribution to victory over the enemy both at the front and in the rear. However, especially as the end of the war approached, youth were increasingly interpreted as a dangerous social environment, giving rise to many anti-Soviet organizations and groups. The war danger spurred Chekists to be extremely suspicious of any form of organized youth amateur activity, be it literary or philosophical groups, let alone quasi-political organizations. As a result, state security authorities with redoubled energy set about identifying and eliminating potential political deviations among the youth. First of all, the target was the children of the outcasts of Soviet society: the "former", "former kulaks", and "enemies of the people" from among the Soviet elites. At the same time, the war temporarily weakened ideological pressure, giving rise to hopes among broad strata of society for certain relaxations and even reforms after the war. A new factor at the final stage of the war was the mass of young people who found themselves in captivity or in the occupied territories, both imaginary and real collaborators, as well as participants in the armed nationalist movement in Ukraine and other Soviet Republics. The response of the security agencies to the intensification of deviant youth activity was the traditional measures of the intelligence services: building the large-scale undercover informant net in the student and student environment, as well as falsification of cases of anti-Soviet organizations.

AB This study focuses on the consequences of conspiracy theories on voter behaviour. I argue that conspiracism is not simply a tendency of populist movements but also holds instrumental value; the candidates and supporters can use conspiracy theories to demonize their opponents, thus resulting in a lower tendency of voters to cast their ballot for them. Given the lack of detailed data concerning adherence to certain conspiracy theories, search aggregate data concerning interest in the conspiracy theory from Google Trends was taken in order to overcome this. Taking the case of Donald Trump's 2016 Presidential campaign, the utilization of a multi-level regression model demonstrates that voters were less likely to vote for Clinton in states where interest in the anti -Clin-ton conspiracy theory was highest, testifying to a 'demonization' effect. The anti-Clinton conspira-cy theories, which included allegations of high-level corruption and plots by political and financial elites, were shown to be effective on lower-income, lower-educated voter cohorts, and members of the white working-class, but not ideological conservatives. These results imply that spreading conspiracy theories finds the most success when it targets those groups which were not necessarily inclined to support a certain candidate from the outset.

The most important element of this process was the crisis of the traditional left, Marxism in its "Comintern" form and the emergence of an influential and extremely productive trend of the "New Left" who proposed a renewal of Marxism, its synthesis with modern trends in historiography, sociology, psychology and philosophy. This work is devoted to the history of the "New Left" in Argentina, where this trend became dominant in public thought, had a huge impact on the politics of this country in the late XXth - early XXI century.

AB COVID-19 pandemic necessitates taking measures that may be very costly from an economic standpoint and likely to make the mass public discontent. If an anti-pandemic regimen does not accomplish its goals, its costs become even harder to justify. We argue that, under such circumstances, cancellation of an anti-pandemic regimen would decrease the reliability of health data because rank-in-file policymakers and bureaucrats have incentives to present more optimistic statistics to signal their competence and politicians would further pressure them to report statistics that appear to agree with the cancellation of restrictions and give legitimacy to taking the measures. Our empirical analyses suggest that closeness to the restrictions' cancellation date is associated with lower reliability of COVID-19 daily cumulative cases and deaths data. Being robust to several sensitivity and robustness checks, this finding is alarming from the perspective of representative democracy and for those who have to survive in these turbulent times.

DE social philosophy; biology; political regime; lysenkoism
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the phenomenon of lysenkoism as a practice of administrative reprisals against scientific opponents, which developed in the natural sciences in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and developing in accordance with the emergence and transformation of the totalitarian political regime in the USSR. The scientific and ideological reasons for the emergence of lysenkoism as a system of theoretical views and philosophical and methodological attitudes of T.D. Lysenko and his followers, summarizing under them the elements of the Marxist-Leninist doctrine. The position on the "inheritance of acquired traits" and the denial of the role of genes in the transmission of hereditary information were put forward by T.D. Lysenko as the basis for administratively promoted recommendations for obtaining forms with "altered heredity" in a short time, which caused the destruction of the foundations of breeding work, seed production and animal husbandry in the country. The escalation of lysenkoism as a method of ideological struggle against scientific opponents in biological and agricultural science, which took place against the backdrop of a tightening of the political regime, led to the denial of classical genetics, the ban on genetic research, defamation and reprisals against scientists who did not share the views of T.D. Lysenko. Modern approaches to attempts to reassess the personality of T.D. Lysenko and the revival of his ideas from the point of view of new data in genetic science. Populist and propagandistic publications about T.D. Lysenko is criticized. The inconsistency of the identification of the paradigms of neolysenkoism and epigenetics is substantiated in view of the interpretation of epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance. The controversy around lysenkoism and modern pseudogenetic theories, taking place on an international scale, allows us to state that the complexity and drama of the development of soviet genetics were directly related to the priority of state ideology and philosophy over the scientific process, and to draw conclusions about the inadmissibility of such an approach in the future.

ID ELECTORAL MANIPULATION; MINORITIES
AB Ethnicity, being one of the most important forms of self-identification, plays a significant role in many political processes, including the electoral process. Many research articles document a systematic relation-ship between ethnic identity and voting. At the same time, there is a dearth of studies about the concrete mechanisms on how ethnicity and voting are con-nected at the individual level. The question of their efficiency remains debat-able. In the article, based on the materials of the focus group discussions in small towns in five ethnic republics of the Russian Federation, the author ana-lyzes such mechanisms and tries to assess their possible effects in the Russian context.
   The research study shows that the factor of ethnicity is very weak in vot-ing at the local level. Although ethnic identification helps reduce information uncertainty due to the presence of the common cultural markers, these mark-ers are not the only or even the priority basis for electoral choices - the so-cio-economic agenda and personal qualities of candidates are equally or even more important. Such mechanisms as group pressure and political machines that are driven by ethnicity almost fail to predict electoral behavior. The re-search findings call into question a number of conclusions based on the cross-sectional analysis of aggregated data, indicating that even if ethnicity plays a role in voting, this role is mediated by other factors.

The study is based on the latest U.S. declassified documents, interviews, memoirs, etc. The author does the problem-chronological analysis to describe the stages of the U.S. Policy toward Iraqi Kurds during the period specified. Analysis. The article is focused on the U.S. diplomatic and intelligence activities aimed at developing approaches to the "communist crisis" and disagreements that arose in the expert community regarding policy decisions. The author considers the U.S. relations with their regional partners (Turkey, Israel, Iran, etc.) on the issues of the "Iraqi crisis" and the Kurdish liberation movement. The paper describes Washington's attitude to Mullah Mustafa Barzani - the Kurdish movement leader - and the KDP activities during Iraq's post-Revolution instability. The author analyzes and summarizes the reasons why the U.S. was reluctant to involve in the domestic conflict between Qasim's followers, Nationalists, Nasserites, Communists and Kurds. Results. The article shows that the CIA and the State Department often misjudged Qasim's relationship with the Iraqi Communist Party and the national Kurdish movement and, as a result, did not have enough time to respond to the rapidly changing political situation, thus adopting the policy of benevolent neutrality.

DT Article
DE radical left parties; Podemos; SYRIZA; France Unbowed; social movements
AB The article is devoted to studying the new radical left parties (NRLP) that either emerged or strengthened in Western Europe in the light of social protests against neoliberal policies and austerity measures. The mid-2010s witnessed the peak of the electoral successes of the NRLP, when, after revisiting the mistakes of the past, the radical left challenged social democrats, who shifted to the right and thus freed up a niche in the political space. De-spite the fact that the mass protests, which swept across Europe, created pre-conditions for strengthening the NRLP everywhere, not all such parties could claim significant electoral achievements. The purpose of the article is to iden-tify the reasons why in some Western European countries the radical left ma-naged to create effective political organizations, while in others they did not. The authors analyze SYRIZA (Greece), Podemos (Spain) and France Un-bowed as examples of successful NRLP, which achieved the best results in the elections. However, only SYRIZA managed to become a senior partner in the government coalition. Podemos had to settle for the role of a junior partner, while the achievements of France Unbowed were even more modest.
   The conducted research allowed the authors to single out several fac-tors that can explain the successful performance of the NLRP in the electoral field. According to their conclusion, the existence of a pluralist democracy is a necessary condition for the efficiency of the NRLP. In addition, the electoral successes of the radical left were prepared by a change in the social structure, which provided the NRLP with a social base - young educated professionals. However, a country's party system, primarily the role and the weight of social democratic parties in a country's political life, is a decisive factor that defines prospects for the NRLP

AB Today most researchers agree that democratic regimes are superior in producing technological innovations to authoritarian regimes, despite the fact that the question of the influence of the type of political regime on economic growth and its most important component, such as innovative activity, remains debatable. At the same time, there are several alternative, although not mutually exclusive, hypotheses about what causes this superiority. One hypothesis suggests institutions that ensure political competition, and above all, competitive elections, are of key importance. According to another hypothesis, the main prerequisite for innovative development lies in the provision for rights and freedoms of citizens.
   The article attempts to test these hypotheses empirically in order to determine which one of them possesses a greater explanatory power. To perform this task, the author employed a method of multi-level regression, which allows taking into account factors at the level of countries, as well as that of individual firms.
   The research conducted by the author shows that the presence of competitive elections is not a sufficient condition for innovative development. In contrast, the provision of civil freedoms is a statistically significant predictor. Thus, the liberal aspect of democracy is more important than its electoral as-pect for producing technological innovations.

DE Marxist atheism; scientific atheism; natural science propaganda;
   socialism in the USSR
AB The main purpose of the article is to reveal the socio-historical context of the emergence of the concept of "scientific atheism", designed to solve ideological and political problems in the USSR in 1954-1964. The article shows how the concept of "scientific atheism" turns into a conceptual category, is filled with new content, forms an appropriate discourse and becomes a tool that produces socially significant meanings used in the practice of ideological production during the period of building socialism in the USSR. The author demonstrates how the understanding of atheism that existed in previous Marxist literature as a philosophical criticism of religion, based on the natural sciences and philosophical materialism and connected with the study of the historical forms of religion and its modern features, was rejected. Such an understanding of atheism did not satisfy the current political demand associated with the new tasks of communist construction. The article shows that a special role in the construction of the ideological component of the concept of "scientific atheism" in the early 1960s was played by I. D. Pantskhava, head of the Department of History and Theory of Atheism at Moscow State University, and also the secretary of the Central Committee L. F. Ilyichev, who headed the Ideological Commission of the Central Committee of the CPSU, which, in the wake of a new anti-religious campaign, initiated the development of practical recommendations in the field of atheistic upbringing of the population, among which the need to form the theoretical content of scientific atheism as an independent philosophical discipline aimed at solving urgent political problems stood out. The article introduces previously unknown archival materials into academic circulation, shedding light on the 1964 discussion about the features of Marxist atheism and the subject of "scientific atheism".

AB The research is aimed at studying students' opinions about corruption at the university. The authors give ambiguous assessments of the nature of corruption at the university, including taking into account gender characteristics. The aim of the work is to determine the nature of corruption, its causes, factors influencing the reduction of corruption, and also to determine the influence of gender on these assessments based on the study of students' opinions about corruption at the university. The methodological basis of the research was works by leading foreign and Russian scientists. The study was conducted using general scientific methods, such as systems analysis, questionnaires, generalization and systematization, comparison. The empirical basis is based on a survey of 400 students and 14 individual semi-structured interviews of students of the Ural State University of Economics and St. Petersburg State University, collected in 2022. As a result of the study, it has been found that the majority of the students, according to them, did not participate in corruption relations, but a third of the respondents consider it as a means suitable in a difficult life situation. According to the students, low salaries, low moral level of some of the professors and staff of the university, as well as ineffective administrative control, have the greatest influence on the existence of corruption at the university. The following can significantly affect the reduction of corruption at the university: increased responsibility for acts of corruption, increased salaries of university professors and staff, as well as increased administrative control. Compared to female students, male students are more willing to commit acts of corruption, if these acts bring benefits, help get out of a difficult situation; they more often carry out commercial bribery at the university, use the official position of professors and administrators to solve personal problems. Male students consider financial factors (low salaries of most university professors and staff) and female students consider personal moral qualities as the most important causes of corruption. A gender approach was also manifested in the evaluation of measures to reduce corruption: male students preferred administrative, forceful measures of struggle (increased responsibility, control), as well as increased salaries for university professors and staff, while female students thought of timely legal information and trust as measures to prevent corruption. The hypothesis is confirmed that gender has an impact on the university students' assessment of the nature of corruption, its causes, as well as factors that, according to students, can reduce the level of corruption.

AB The subject of the article is the problem of the crisis of ideals generated by the European Enlightenment and the Modern era, as interpreted by Russian thinkers of the first third of the 20th century. Building on the conception of Semyon Frank, the author analyzes the relationship between the socio-political ideals of the Enlightenment in the Russian version and false "idols" that led Russia and Europe to an unprecedented escalation of evil in the early 20th century, is analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the assumption that the ideals of democracy as a true power of the people, as a result of uncritical implementation, lead to revolutionary violence and further reproduction of tyranny. Two versions of democracy are considered: according to Frank, one of them is genuine, based on the idea of disinterested service to the truth, and the second is "false", oriented towards a totalitarian utopia, fundamentally hostile to freedom. The author also analyzes Frank's views on the phenomenon of the "idol of culture", which is based on the idea of linear progress. According to Frank, linear progress cannot prevent Russia and Europe from falling into barbarism. Moreover, it even significantly contributed to that breakdown. It is concluded that Frank as a Christian philosopher and political thinker became one of the relatively few (along with, for example, Fyodor Stepun and Vladimir Weidle), but all the more significant conductors of the Russian cultural tradition in Europe and the European cultural tradition in Russia: that is, a genuine personification of the phenomenon of a "Russian European".

AB Lefebvre's statement that with the advent of capitalism the state and the city turned into abstractions, and that the rules for the cities are written by those who do not live in them, namely administrative powers and corporations, is legitimate. Informatization, the so-called "information society", does not solve the socioeconomic problems of the disruption. The informatization of space does not solve the problem, but rather generates "cybernanthropes" (Lefebvre), creating an illusion of prompt solution of complex management tasks. Without denying the successes of the information revolution, even agreeing conditionally with the concept of the "fourth industrial revolution", we are forced to support infoskeptics who wrote that information discourse and information strategies in general resemble the manipulations of illusionists. Lefebvre's original triad, described in The Production of Space, encompasses firstly spatial practice, including everyday reality. Secondly, it encompasses the representation of space, as a product of intention of scientists and planners, loaded with meanings and signs dominating in a given society. Thirdly, it encompasses representational space, "lived through its associated images and symbols", attempting to "appropriate the imagination". Public spaces, including their projections on social networks, are necessary not only for the generation of conflicts, but also for the possibility of consolidation of spaces, which ensure the sustainability of the city in a rapidly changing world. Lefebvre, in his Right to the City, understood the latter as a creation, which gives a chance to reassemble the city on a new semantic basis, in fact, using political construction. And in this regard, we think the constructivist approach is the most productive one. In the conditions of the coronavirus crisis, the city is disenchanted, it ceases to feel like an abstraction controlled from the outside. It starts to understand that the abstract and anonymous space of administration is limited by cubicles. Having taken the position of political constructivism, we see through which communication mechanisms such right is established, how the goals of factual city owners are proclaimed and masked. For this purpose, we set a framework that will allow us to consider, from the perspective of the urban semiosphere, various episodes and cases described by a number of researchers of the changing "urban world". Finally, taking as a model the Report on Smart Sustainable Cities, presented by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in 2020, we conclude that it is difficult to solve global problems without the city as a subject of politics.

DT Article
DE Russian Empire; Tauride Province; German landholdings; colonists; state

AB The historical upheavals of the first quarter of the 20(th) century seriously affected the state of land holdings of German settlers in the Russian Empire. The revolution of 1905 and the First World War affected the farms of German owners in particular and changed the system of land relations in general. Unjustified interference of state structures in matters of private land ownership, when the estates of German settlers were liquidated without taking into account their economic profitability, adversely affected not only the farms themselves, but also the state as a whole. Legalizations introduced in 1915-1916 on the reduction of German land ownership affected the property system of the former colonists of the Tauride Province. The adoption of draft laws was a controversial phenomenon and caused social instability in society. The implementation of state decisions primarily affected the most prosperous and well-known German dynasties, which suffered enormous losses. A negative attitude towards the German ethnic group was systematically formed in society, which led to a resonance among other ethnic groups. In view of the negative impact of these steps on the economic, political, and social condition in the Tauride province, it was decided to temporarily suspend the previously adopted laws. The suspension of the processes was often an irreversible process, since the land property had already been alienated and put up for sale. At the same time, most of the Crimean lands were already at the disposal of the state, despite the imperfection of the current legislative framework. However, in February 1917, the fate of the German estates was predetermined by the seizure of "living and dead" inventory. This was the first manifestation of changes in private land ownership in German settlements, which fully occurred in the early 1920s.

AB The research focuses on the question of the governance strategy of an increasingly complex social system. "The complication related to the contemporary socio-political situation, which requires the participation of various stakeholders with their knowledge in the process of decision-making. Digital technologies as an ambiguous context and mediators of public communication exacerbate this issue. The author conducts research at the intersection of epistemological and socio-political contexts and implements conceptual analysis of governability and recursivity, revealed, firstly, to the problem of governing an increasingly complex system and, secondly, the conditions for its resolution. The concept of contingency supplements the concept of recursivity. The article consistently reveals the problematic nature of the concepts of governability and recursivity, the dual use of recursivity in political sciences, the ambiguity of the relationship between recursivity and contingency. The analysis of concepts allows identifying the conditions for both the involvement of additional active participants with their knowledge in governance, and their use as passive carriers of information. The author clarifies this alternative through two models of the relation of contingency and recursivity, namely, the "victory" or "defeat" of the first. As an example of how the models work, the author uses a study of citizen participation in city governance through digital platforms. She concludes that the governance strategy, taking into account the model of "victory" of contingency, provides conditions for the recognition of new active participants in decision-making processes.

AB The article present a response to the arguments of Ilya T. Kasavin on the development of science and on the problem as its source. At the beginning of the article, the author refers to the idea of scientific progress and shows its necessity, as well as the possibility of a critical attitude to it. She associates criticism of the idea of scientific progress with its character of exclusivity and subjectivity, discusses opportunity preserve the idea, and respond to this criticism. Discussing this opportunity, the author offers an addition to the interpretation of the problem by Ilya T. Kasavin as a form of knowledge. The author interprets the problem as an identified disagreement and a source of social interactions. At the same time, the problem remains a source of progress, but a social certainty complements its epistemological one. The author gives examples of such problems as identified disagreements, firstly, between various subjects governing science and, secondly, between science, the authorities and the public. She shows that it is possible to interpret this kind of problem as a "boundary object" (Star & Griesemer) and demonstrates the constructiveness of the conceptual connection between the problem and the boundary object. In conclusion, she argues that such an expansion of the meaning of the problem, firstly, gives an answer to criticism regarding the idea of progress in science, freeing it from exclusivity, since the problem turns out to be both a source of progress and a condition for social interaction. Secondly, the existence of science as a public good is additionally justified, since the problem actualizes cognitive diversity and attracts various actors to interaction. Thirdly, the prospects of science are presented in a more realistic way, since epistemological definitions of the meaning of the problem serve as a possible basis for the scientist's work on the organization of social interaction around science, contributing to its development.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop and quantify possible scenarios for the implementation of climate policy, as well as the opportunities for achieving carbon neutrality by the middle of the 21st century or earlier. For this purpose, two scenarios are considered - basic and transformational. The baseline scenario includes measures that least affect the existing socio-political and economic interests with the greatest contribution from deforestation, modernization of technologies for the use of hydrocarbons in industry and cleaner transport. The limitations of the baseline scenario will not allow achieving carbon neutrality by the middle of the 21st century. The transformational scenario takes into account the most realistic options for closing the gap between the official scenario developed by the Government of the Russian Federation shortly before the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference and more ambitious options for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 or earlier. In our transformational scenario, Russia reaches carbon neutrality 10 years earlier, by 2040, and subsequently turns into a net sink of greenhouse gases, including due to the huge potential of forest plantations.

AB An invariable characteristic of Russian elections in the post-Soviet period is the relatively-high turnout and electoral support of incumbents demonstrated by many of the ethnic republics. The article is devoted to the study of the reasons for the relationship between the ethnic factor and the reproduction of political loyalty. Unlike most previous studies, the authors test existing theories on the basis of opinion polls data rather than official electoral statistics. This makes it possible to include the ethnic characteristics of voters at the individual level in the analysis, rather than regional or local levels. The statistical analysis is complemented by the study of qualitative data in the form of expert interviews and materials from three focus groups conducted in the villages of Bashkortostan and Tatarstan. The results obtained make it possible to assert that the political loyalty of the Russian republics is determined not by cultural specifics, but by the nature of the settlement structure. Ethnic republics include a relatively-high proportion of the agrarian population, a significant part of which is represented by ethnic minorities. This overlap of ethnic and rural segments determines the reproduction of the electoral super-majority. However, the nature of this phenomenon is explained not by the"patriarchal culture" of non-Russian ethnic groups, but by the institutional capabilities of the local administration to monitor and control the political behavior of rural voters. The study also made it possible to clarify the role of the ethnic factor in contemporary electoral processes, which also affects the reproduction of political loyalty not only to the heads of the republics, but also to non-ethnic federal political actors. However, its influence is also conditioned by the political and institutional characteristics of the ethnic republics, and not by the cultural characteristics of the titular ethnic groups.

DE protest mood; student youth; protest behaviour
AB The article presents the results of an empirical sociological study of the main causes of students' protest sentiments. The study included the collection and analysis of data obtained through questionnaires (n=608), in-depth interviews (n=12) and focus groups (n=10) of students of Altai Krai. Reasons of students' protest sentiments were determined by the analysis of subjective assessments of satisfaction with life and education, attitude to distance education, as well as current problems that could provoke social tension and conflict. Indicators of students' readiness to protest actions were: attitude towards people attending protests, evaluation of the effectiveness of peaceful and radical protest behaviour; students' willingness to participate in rallies. The study identified the following trends. Not only the degree of satisfaction with the conditions of their life and educational activities, but also the quality of relationships with others influence the formation of students' protest mood. Many students suffered from biased and unfair treatment by teachers or peers, which affected their mental state. Various forms of discrimination can trigger protests by young people to claim their rights. The most pressing issues for young people are the economic and political situation. This raises concerns about the financial situation of both students and their families. These problems may encourage protest behaviour. Psychological, religious and ethnic aspects also influence protest mood. The respondents' opinions on the effectiveness of different ways of expressing protest actions are different. Many respondents note the effectiveness of both peaceful and radical methods in achieving their goals. Students are not ready to take part in protests; however, they do not completely deny this possibility. The results obtained indicate the importance of conducting additional studies to identify other factors of protest mood among young people in order to predict and prevent youth protests and ensure safety in educational institutions.

AB The transfer of education in universities to distance and "hybrid" (which combines remote and classroom forms) models was carried out as part of the introduction of antiCOVID restrictions (the 2020-2021 academic year). The conditions of necessary selfisolation influenced all the aspects of students' life: from study sessions and work during extracurricular hours to ways of communication and spending free time. In this regard, an urgent problem is to determine changes in students' time budgets in the conditions of self-isolation in comparison with the " pre-COVID" period. For this purpose, a study was conducted, the object of which was 205 students of three universities (Southern Federal University, Don State Technical University (Rostov- on-Don), and V.I. Vernadsky Crimean Federal University (Simferopol) over the period from November 2019 to March 2021. The method of self-photographing with the help of chronocards was chosen as the main research method. The accuracy of measurements was 15 minutes; the term for filling one chronocard was one week. An essay about the most memorable day and a written analysis of the subjective assessment of students' satisfaction with their time management were also used. The main conclusions of the study are as follows. First, the time allotted for studies at universities in the "pre-COVID" and "COVID" periods did not change significantly, since all three surveyed universities (within the studied areas of training) were ready to transfer to the distance teaching and learning mode. The difference in the time of university classes was preserved, due to the difference in the Master's and Bachelor's degree programs. Second, during the pandemic period, there was a contradictory tendency for further individualization and, to a certain extent, "encapsulation", isolation of individual time and, at the same time, expansion, increase, "verification" of time in the virtual space of the Internet. Third, the border between study, work, self-education, leisure and current everyday practices was destriyed during the pandemic due to the simultaneous implementation of various types of activities and increased use of distance learning, remote work and communication. Fourth, during the period of "anti-COVID" restrictions, the time that students spent on self-education increased, although mainly in the remote mode. The tendency for students to combine paid work with university learning continued. Fifth, everyday current household practices transformed into the hygiene of the home space and tended to take more time, due to a longer stay at home during partial isolation.

AB The article proposes a systematic assessment of the right to the Internet in the context of modern legal and political challenges. The authors substantiate the thesis that the right to the Internet is a complex category that cannot be considered solely in terms of providing technical capabilities and overcoming the digital divide (inequality) between different social groups and states. Much more complex and important is the consideration of the right to the Internet in the context of the corresponding duty of states not to impede the possibility of information exchange via the Internet, as well as in the plane of the search for a "golden mean" between the right to the Internet and natural human rights. The main purpose of the article was to determine the main features of the right to the Internet in the context of human and civil rights and freedoms and to analyze the main manifestations of digital discrimination as a consequence of the digital divide. A detailed methodological basis of the article contributed to the achievement of the abovementioned purpose. The research was based on a systematic method, which made it possible to consider the right to the Internet as a complex and dynamically developing legal and political category. The authors used functional and logical (deduction, induction and analogy) methods, as well as a number of particular scientific methods: historical, sociological and statistical. The approach proposed in the article to determine the key parameters of the right to the Internet was substantiated mainly on the basis of the application of comparative legal, formal legal and axiological methods. The methodology of the research made it possible to formulate and substantiate the conclusion that the right to the Internet in the face of modern legal and political challenges is undergoing a qualitative transformation both in the direction of expanding the positive obligations of the state to overcome the digital divide, and in the direction of restricting the right to freedom of Internet communication under the auspices of ensuring the right to privacy and the need to respect the public interest. The presence of << double standards >> in determining the boundaries of the right to the Internet leads to conflicting legal decisions and allows us to predict the aggravation of this contradiction in the context of the rapid development of digital platforms and the active sanction policy of the collective West.

DT Article
DE philosophy of labour; artificial intelligence; contemporary culture;
   pandemic consequences; crisis of capitalism
AB The labour paradigm is undergoing cardinal changes in the current conditions. Among the main factors of the ongoing changes, the authors of the article single out large -scale automation of labour and the introduction of artificial intelligence, leading to the replacement of classical labour with intangible labour. The review compares different approaches to the evolution of attitudes towards work in the digital age. The rejection of traditional labour values and labour culture, declared by modern social theorists, is opposed to the possibilities of non-material labour, self-creation, 'out-of-the-box thinking' in their search for new foundations and meanings of human existence. The theoretical basis of the article is a layer of works, which is usually attributed to the interdisciplinary direction of the humanities and social sciences - 'philosophy of labour.' The authors rely both on the fundamental works of the classics of the concept of a working society and on modern social theorists, futurologists, researchers of culture and the political process. Answering the question of what a person will do under a large -scale replacement of human labour with the labour of machines, the authors conclude that the ambivalent nature of the processes in the world of work will be created. This issue acquires particular urgency and demand for solutions in the field of social policy under the crisis of capitalism and the global epidemic situation, which are entering a state of convergence at the turn of the 2020s.

DE logical procedure; logical operation; cognitive paradigm; logical
   fallacy; conceptualization procedure; conclusion
AB The article presents the results of elaboration a fragment of the logical procedure theory. It is based on the cognitive approach. Within the framework of this approach, logical procedure (LP) is considered as a system of actions or operations aimed at constructing or transforming a certain logical object. The cognitive approach to LP is concretized on the basis of the methodology of analyzing the intellectual problems solutions. The article develops the ideas proposed in the paper "Epistemological status of a logical procedure: logical vs cognitive?" (Tomsk State University Journal of Philosophy Sociology and Political Science, No. 60) and is focused on the structural analysis of logical procedures. The author differentiates LP and a logical operation: a logical operation is considered as an elementary LP, not divided into components. The connection between a logical operation and LP is explicated as a subordination: every logical operation (and any set of interrelated operations) is LP, however, it is not true that any LP is a regularized set of logical operations and only them. In the structures of LP can be found the cognitive components that are not logical. The article proposes classifications of LPs based on their structural characteristics. LPs are divided by the number of procedural elements into simple (equivalent to logical operations) and composite ones. By the connections between structural elements the author differentiates linear, cyclic and branched LP. Various types of LP are illustrated by algorithms of specific procedures. The concept of the form of LP is introduced. LP-form is understood as the organization of sub-procedures in their fixed subsequence, which ensures the thought movement towards the sought result. The normative (providing a logically correct result) and descriptive (characterizing the unfolding of LP in natural thinking) forms of LP are differentiated. Author distinguishes and describes the relationships (identity, similarity, partial resemblance, distinction) between normative and descriptive forms. The destruction of the normative form in the natural fulfillment of LP is considered as a source of logical fallacies. The author substantiates the importance of the structural analysis of LP for the development of practical applications of LP-theory.

AB The article deals with the issue of philosopher's identity and their search for the niche of their own. The basis for this analysis was found in the book Richard Rorty: A 'fringe analytic philosopher' by Oxana Tselishcheva and in Rorty's own material. The article analyses Tselishcheva's search for Rorty's place within philosophical discourse. The article outlines the vast palette of ideas and self-ascribed characteristics Rorty chose when speaking about and comparing himself to other philosophers that are present within the book. As a result of this analysi Tselishcheva points out several fundamental dichotomies of philosophical ideas as presented by Rorty: analytical and continental philosophy; systemic and hortatory ones; normal and revolutionary ones; centripetal and centrifugal ones; logic and science based and metaphor and literature based ones. Tselishcheva applies these classifications to Rorty himself and concludes that he proves to be difficult to pin down. She states that Rorty should be considered more of a continental philosopher as well as more of a hortatory centrifugal literature based revolutionary. This article in turn asks what drives Rorty to shift between all these philosophical positions, without fully committing to any of them? The article agrees with Tselishcheva that this driver was Rorty's understanding of philosophy as a Big Conversation. Rorty abandoned the notion that philosophy must seek ultimate objective answers and strived to make philosophers mediators moderating the Big Conversation as it was happening instead. This is what defined his own identity. Philosophy happens accidentally. It is defined by the principle of contingency. In the absence of objective truth or any hidden final realities, a philosopher can engage in a Conversation out of solidarity, not truth seeking. The article concludes stating that it is possible for a philosopher to identify not as a student of any specific school of thought but as a carrier of their unique opinion and point of view. Thus, philosopher's topos is emergent in nature.

AB Japan has long been a country closed to Russia. According to some sources, acquaintance with its inhabitants began in the 17th century, and we received the first direct information about the way of life of the Japanese from the descriptions of those who explored the Far East in the 18th century, as well as from Russian sailors. A particularly invaluable contribution to the question of understanding Japan at the initial stage was made by captain V.M. Golovnin, who was captured by the Japanese. Studying a country means not only focusing on political or economic relations, but also on the psychological perception of the inhabitants of the other country. This level - the level of soft power - is also important for building longterm good neighborly relations, affecting the mentality and the ability to perceive each other in a tolerant way. The purpose of this article is to analyze various sources, both academic and everyday ones, to characterize the image of Japan that has developed in the minds of Russian citizens. To achieve this goal, a phenomenological approach is used in the context of the "perception of the other". The authors consistently prove the dominance of historical memory in the development of relations, which proceeded according to the type of non-military rivalry and conflict resolution. The logic and structure of the article is a movement from the analysis of relations between the inhabitants of our countries, starting with the notes of navigators of the 19th century, towards the analysis of the dynamics of current relations, and, finally, the discussion of the attitudes and perceptions of Japanese culture by the Russian youth. The authors conclude that the image of Japan in the minds and mentality of Russian citizens is formed according to the agonistic type, which implies the acceptance of the other, and not rejection, as is the case of the "perception of the other" according to the polemos type.

   Kovalev; politics
AB In the contemporary history of Russian political science, there is a common view that the formation of the Soviet political scientific tradition and Russian political science occurs in the late 1980s - early 1990s. That was the time when Russian political science began to gain its subjectivity, borrowing its tools and agenda from the West: from an understanding of "politics" and "power" to the fashion to research some popular issues as democratization and modernization. One of the objectives of this article is to present an alternative point of view and draw some attention not only to the duration of the history of the Soviet political scientific tradition but also to the developments of domestic authors, demonstrating their intellectual connection with foreign colleagues even in conditions of ideological isolation. The literature review shows that the issue of the Soviet political scientific tradition developing, especially in universities, is given quite a little attention, especially against the background of the study of the institutional and organizational development of Soviet political science in academic institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and, later, political science in Russian universities and analytical centers. The authors draw attention to this issue, following the formation of the Soviet political science tradition in universities with examples from the works of Professor of Moscow University Alexander Kovalev, considering his ideas on politics in the context of world political theory development, its history, and modern approaches. The intellectual legacy of Kovalev demonstrates the importance of such addressing to local subjects of the history of political science of Russia, where the gap between the Soviet and foreign research agenda is not as large as is generally believed. The Soviet political science tradition, including its university branch, reveals its connection with world research in many aspects related to raising the question of politics and the political, in studies of the functions and tasks of politics and political theory, in attention to human nature. The special emphasis on the regulatory and clarifying nature of the political, as shown in the article, brings the positions of Kovalev closer to the positions of modern constructivism and phenomenology in the sociology of knowledge, to the positions of institutionalism, which emphasizes the problem of uncertainty of political behavior. Today we see interest in such phenomena in sociocultural studies of human behavior and values that have a significant impact on public administration. However, it is also important to study how these research interests have historically developed, including within the framework of Soviet political science.

AB The article examines the use of examples from Byzantine history to explain current and historical events in Russia at the end of the 17th - first quarter of the 18th century. The usage of historical examples to clarify the meaning of events is one of the most common explanatory strategies. The source base of the research is mainly composed of panegyric literature, legislative acts, preparatory legislative documents, works of a historical and political nature. The history of Byzantium was well known in Russia at the end of the 17th century, however, the frequency of examples from Byzantine history was much inferior to the biblical and ancient ones. The article shows that in the studied chronological period, Byzantium was known to Russian authors mainly under the name << Greek Tsardom >>, the history of which dates back to the era of Emperor Constantine the Great. The name of this emperor and other emperors of early Byzantium (late Rome) were often mentioned as an example in the texts of the late 17th - first quarter of the 18th century. The article analyzes the use of facts from Byzantine history to clarify legislative acts, build historical analogies for Russian tsars, primarily Peter I. The role of the Byzantine example in the situation of Peter's acceptance of the imperial title is also shown, as well as the application of the fall of Byzantium as political notation.

DE Wittgenstein; diaries; autobiography; philosophy; anthropological

AB The article analyzes the relationship between Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophical works and his spiritual, ethical experiences presented in the diaries of different years. The author reveals the anthropological significance of philosophy and autobiography as practices of self-creation, considers the dichotomy between vanity and humility inherent in Wittgenstein's autobiographical discourse. A careful study of autobiographical materials (diaries, notes, and letters) can allow one to read Wittgenstein's philosophical writings in the spirit in which they were conceived, as well as to see the commonality of his philosophical and personal interests. The author shows that, for Wittgenstein, the wartime notebooks of 1914-1916, written in the face of death, are a practice of preserving himself, his freedom and a way to rise above the baseness, cruelty, and obscenity of his environment. The themes of the diaries from the 1930s are somewhat different. The autobiographical notes of these years replace a person to confide to and also act as a space for introspection and even confession. The author emphasizes the fundamental difference between autobiography and autobiographical notes: autobiography is an intellectual act of presenting personal experiences, adjusted for potential readers, in which I am presented to myself as the other, while autobiographical notes (diaries) are a kind of activity of will and spirit, an existential practice that unfolds in the present and lacks an explicit opposition between the author and the hero. In the conclusion, the author argues that the close relationship between Wittgenstein's philosophy and personal notes (and his life in general) is determined by the fact that these practices for him are primarily a work on himself, his own point of view and his way of perceiving things. According to Wittgenstein, it is necessary to break one's own pride in order to engage in both diary keeping and philosophical activities with honesty and dignity. For Wittgenstein, philosophy is a way of life, namely, a life of knowledge, in which reflection on logic naturally coexists with repentance of one's sins as two sides of the same personal task. The trajectory of Wittgenstein's life path demonstrates his continuous ethical reflection, his adherence to a genuine demand for honesty, uncovering, and his desire to live a decent, good life, visible sub specie aetemitatis.

DE problem of external world; virtual reality; computer simulation
   hypothesis; virtual realism
AB The article is a continuation of analyzing the skeptical problem of the external world in the context of the computer simulation hypothesis. The beginning was in the article "The Computer Simulation Hypothesis and the Problem of Skepticism". The thinking is within the framework of a new version of the matrix/metaphysical hypothesis by David Chalmers. The skeptical problem is formulated and discussed in the form of two questions: 1. Can the subject know that he is in a simulation? 2. Can the simulated world be real? The hypothesis of computer simulation is skeptical if the statements of the subject in simulation about the external world are false. The author pays attention to the concept of the subject inside the simulated world and formulates two concepts. The first is a biological subject: a biological being that is connected to the simulation using a special device (contacts, wires, controllers, etc.). The biological subject is not a part of the simulation, but can only interact with it. The second concept is a digital subject: a simulated being, completely digital. The digital subject is a part of the simulation. These concepts are considered in the case of a perfect simulation that does not allow errors, glitches, etc., and an imperfect one that allows some errors. For the subject inside the simulation, it depends on whether he can know that the world around him is simulated or not. If the subject is inside a perfect simulation, then its program prescribes in advance whether he will be able to find evidence of this or not. Imperfect simulation assumes the possibility of errors and evidence that can be detected by the subject. If the subject is in a perfect simulation, he may never get proof of this, because her perfect program is written in such a way that the simulated world cannot be distinguished from the real one. As an answer to the question whether the simulated world can be considered real, the position of virtual realism and some arguments in its favor are given. The author comes to the conclusion that, firstly, the subject may know that he is in a simulation, if the simulation is imperfect. And secondly, from the point of virtual realism, for the subjects inside the simulation, regardless of whether they are biological or digital, the simulated world surrounding them will be real for them.

AB The author of the article gives a detailed analysis of the entry of 1136 of the Novgorod First Chronicle. The chronicle describes how the Novgorodians as-sembled for a veche and made a crucial political decision-they banished the prince Vsevolod, brother of the ruling Kievan prince, and invited the prince Svyatoslav, who belonged to the competing clan of the Chernigov Riurikids. The author concludes that the entry was composed by two chroniclers-one who had worked under the Vsevolod's rule, and the other one who continued working on the chronicle under the patronage of the Novgorod bishop Nifont since 1136. Based on the textual critics, the author explains several historical facts anew. He joins the opinion that the substitution of the princes in 1136 was indeed a mile-stone in formation of the republican system in medieval Novgorod. However, he shows that the break of Novgorod from Kiev turned out to be a complicated and painful experience. Bishop Nifont played a crucial role in the events of 1136 in Novgorod.

DE civilization; development; Iran; India; China; Japan; archaism;
   capitalism; socialism; tradition
AB The problem of civilizational development confronts any country every time in a crucial period of its history. A sharp turning point in the countries of the Asian region came in the middle of the 20th century, when the colonial system collapsed and the former colonies, as well as dependent countries gained political sovereignty. The main problem for them was to determine the further path of their development. As a result of the broad political discourse that accompanied the national liberation movement of the 19th - the first half of the 20th century, everyone chose its own path: Iran chose Shah's regime and accelerated modernization according to the Western model; India embarked on the path of building a democratic, federal, secular republic with a mixed planned economy and a strong state sector; China proclaimed a people's republic led by the Communist Party on the way to building a Chinese socialism; Japan constructed a parliamentary state (while preserving the traditional imperial monarchy), implementing the scientific and technological revolution and the active development of the capitalist model of the economy. Half a century later, there are radical changes in the previously taken political course of Iran, India and China, which is manifested in the archaization of the political space. This is discussed in this article, the author of which considers the modern experience of civilizational development of the leading Asian countries to be instructive and warning against the temptation to turn to the archaic when forming their own path of civilizational development.

AB The article continues the discussion of the problem raised by I.T. Kasavin of effective management of science as a territory of cognitive freedom. A number of theoretical collisions that accompany the concept of effective science are considered. The author focuses on the oppositions between cognitive diversity and the common good, scientific autonomy and collectivization of knowledge, state regulation of science and cognitive freedom. The concept of cognitive diversity is replacing the traditional modern view of science as a universal codified knowledge, neutral in relation to private interests and material realization in products and services. Today's science is characterized by a high degree of material and social involvement, which leads to external and internal cognitive diversity. External diversity is expressed by the multiplicity of relatively autonomous research teams competing with each other for resources. Internal diversity refers to the pluralism of social and cognitive positions represented within a research team. In the context of M. Callon's argument (1994) and the discussion in E&PS (2020), the question is asked under what theoretical conditions today's science with its cognitive diversity can be considered a common good. It is shown that institutional or individual autonomy in science is not always equivalent to the pursuit of private interests. At the same time, the state affiliation and state funding of science are not automatically translated into cognitive universalism and a fair distribution of knowledge. It is also shown that the relationship between cognitive diversity and scientific autonomy is far from unambiguous. If the external form of cognitive diversity seals scientific communities, then the internal form, on the contrary, destroys their tightness due to the penetration of extra-scientific actors into these communities. The internal permeability of the boundaries of scientific communities contributes to the collectivization of scientific knowledge and increases the responsibility of society for evaluating scientific results and supporting science as a common good.

AB Why do some regional entrepreneurs engage in conflicts with the heads of the subnational units of the Russian Federation within a system that puts economic elites in a deliberately unequal position in relation to the authorities? Based on the analysis of conflicts between governors and busi-nessmen in Karelia, the author hypothesizes that contradictions around re-distribution, combined with the availability of the independent resources e.g., branchy patronal networks, drive such confrontation. According to the author's conclusion, the federal center also plays a significant role. When de-ciding whether to start confrontation with governors, regional actors could count on the support from Moscow and resignation of an undesirable regional leader. However, due to the peculiarity of the external environment, primari-ly institutional and informational, the rationality of such behavior often turns out to be low. The opaque informal rules, which electoral authoritarianism relies upon, affect the ability of actors to create adequate cognitive schemata. The informational environment, in which the regional elites operate, sends them unclear and contradictory signals about the limits of acceptable actions and their possible consequences. In turn, the formal preservation of an insti-tution of elections and parties leads to the formation of identities that narrow the set of available behavioral strategies. The mechanism of mutual learning does not work either: under conditions when the resources available to coun-ter-actors cannot be verified, and the rules of the game change with a gover-nor's turnover, reliance on the previous experience is fraught with strategic miscalculations.

ID DE-EUROPEANIZATION; CRISES
AB Exit of Britain from the European Union resuscitated academic discussions on the topic of the certainty value for the unfolding of disintegrative trends in the united Europe. Nevertheless, no general perception has emerged yet of how Brexit is likely to influence the organizational prospects and viability of the European integration grouping. In most cases the conceptualizations do not escape the presentation of dichotomy between integration and disintegration as two ultimo states in international relations. In fact, these are two processes, more complexly co-related. Each of them can include a wide array of structural arrangements, some differentiation dynamism, different levels of centralization in separate domains, as well as certain (variable) numbers of participants in distinct arrangements. In this article the meaning of Brexit as a condition of further European (dis)integration is treated, as based on Alexander Bogdanov's theory of organization. This theory serves to reconsider the established renderings of such key notions, as integration, disintegration and differentiation.
   The new sight is gained of immune after-effects of prior Europeanization for the political system of the UK. Cases of the Economic and Monetary Union and the Northern Ireland Protocol receive separate treatment. The latter one presents a path-breaking design for differentiated integration with subnational region participation. Yet to realize the potential of the Protocol in full, political will is needed from both London and Brussels.
   On the most basic level, once this large country left the EU, one could hardly imagine any of its remaining 27 members to head off further progressive development of European integration. At the same time, it has to be acknowledged that, in order to make headway in terms of integration, the EU system, rather than unification and centralization, is in need of intensified differentiation. Meanwhile, the supranational institutions, and the European Commission most notably, remain oriented towards uniform integration as their priority. This can result in lower efficacy of the EU integration policy.

ID BIAS
AB Political trolling has recently become a new manipulation tool employed in digital politics. A large body of political science research that addresses online trolling focuses however either on troll detection or the description of trolls' activities and strategies. This literature however largely ignores the issue of the perception of trolls by social media users. As a result, scarce research sheds light on the effects of political trolling on social media. From a methodological perspective, the situation is exacerbated by the prevalence of studies that draw on troll detection via human annotation of social media accounts. Sidestepping the issue of troll perception can dramatically bias the results of empirical studies in this context. This paper helps bridge this gap in academic literature on political trolling by analyzing the perception of trolling on VK, one of most popular social media platforms in Russia. We draw on scholarship on selective perception to develop the hypothesis that people with different attitudes towards the Russian government will tend to label social media posts with the opposite stance as trolling. We test this hypothesis using an original collection of survey data that we analyze using state-of-the-art mixed effects regression models. Our analysis reveals that opposition-leaning respondents show differential perception of pro-government and anti-government posts and tend to label the former as trolling. However, we do not find similar results of pro-government social media users. Our findings indicate important methodological limitations of empirical studies based on human-labeled accounts and highlight starking differences in the perception of the online political information by government-leaning and opposition-leaning respondents, thereby raising important questions for future research.

ID WITTGENSTEIN
AB The article discusses the possible existence of private physical objects. The term "private physical object" refers to a hypothetical physical object, which is directly observable for just one (and only) agent (and I regard this constraint as being of purely metaphysical nature). At the beginning of the article, I investigate the issue of the correct application of the "privacy constraint" to physical objects, and the issue of compatibility of this constraint with all standard universal characteristics of physical objects, including the following: to exist independently of subjects ( independently of language, thought, apprehension, knowledge, etc.), to be at least indirectly observable, to possess properties, to stand in relations to one another, to be concrete (to be non-abstract, to exist in space and time, to have causes and to have effects). I show that publicity is not a constitutive property of physical objects. In the second part of the article, I aim to provide a satisfactory criterion of identity for private physical objects. I show that being private and having an identity criterion are not incompatible conditions. I consider two main models of the identity criterion - a one-level criterion of identity and a two-level criterion of identity - and several examples of universal diachronic identity criteria for physical objects. Using these models of identity criterion along with the examples of universal diachronic identity criteria for physical objects, I formulate an exemplary identity criterion for private physical objects. I also consider some features of the comparison procedure for private physical objects. I demonstrate that for any private physical objects only indirect intersubjective comparison procedures are allowed. I conclude that private physical objects can have all standard universal characteristics of physical objects, and that it is possible to provide a satisfactory criterion of identity for private physical objects, which, in turn, proves the fallacy of the thesis that being private and having an identity criterion are incompatible conditions. Therefore, one can consistently consider private physical objects as possible entities.

AB It is a common practice among social scientists to use "factor analysis" and "principal components analysis" interchangeably, even though PCA is not a factor extraction method, but a dimension reduction technique. Most of the recent studies with factor analysis rely solely on PCA or fail to specify which factor extraction method was used. Supposedly, it is caused by the lack of structured and comprehensive guidance on the selection of factor extraction methods. The aim of this study is to develop a theoretically and empirically justified algorithm of factor extraction method selection, depending on a combination of research context features, such as (a) sample size, (b) number of indicators specifying each factor, (c) size, (d) range of communalities, (e) presence of model error and (f) distribution of indicators. Seven factor extraction methods were studied: principal component analysis, weighted and generalized least squares method, maximum likelihood method, principal axis analysis, alpha-factor analysis, and image factoring. Theoretically justified algorithm was created and tested via statistical experiment with Monte Carlo simulation. Following the general outline of previous works' experimental designs, we specified factor loadings matrices for each research context with nonzero loadings, derived correlation matrices and produced 500 Monte Carlo simulated samples (3000 samples in total) per research context. Every factor extraction method was applied to every sample and the resulting factor loadings matrices and communalities were recorded and summarized. Four criteria of factor analysis extraction adequacy were applied: squared mean errors of factor loadings, squared mean errors and absolute mean errors of communalities, and number of Heywood cases. As a result we formulated four main recommendations: it is advised to use (1) principal axis analysis or alpha-factor analysis, if a model error is suspected, (2) maximum likelihood method or generalized least squares method, if the sample is large enough and indicators are normally distributed, or vice versa, if the sample is not large enough and distribution of indicators differs from normal, (3) maximum likelihood method, if the sample is large enough, but the indicators are not normally distributed, or if the indicators are normally distributed, but the sample size is not large enough and the communalities are small, (4) generalized least squares method, if the indicators are normally distributed and the communalities are large, but the sample size is not large enough.

AB In recent years, the topic of populism has become one of the most popular in Political Science. At the same time, the very content of the concept of populism remains subject of scientific debates, which inevitably af-fects empirical studies, because it is the theoretical framework that determines the choice of specific analysis tools. The article intends to serve as a kind of navigator for those who plan to engage in an empirical study of populism, to outline the set of conceptualizations of this phenomenon that are currently used. The article considers three theoretical approaches to populism - ide-ational, political-strategic, and performative. The author briefly touches upon the history and content of each of these approaches, discusses their empirical application, as well as their inherent advantages and disadvantages, after which he shows in what type of research they can be productive. According to his conclusion, ideational approach is optimal for conducting cross-national studies or extensive quantitative studies within one country. Political-strategic ap-proach could be useful when studying populism in Latin America or in coun-tries, where parties are poorly institutionalized. Performative approach could be a better choice if the study focuses on populist interactions with the media, or on a particular case study.

DE Richard Rorty; irony; self-determination; identity; neopragmatism
AB The article is a response to Sergey Smirnov's study of Richard Rorty's philosophical self-definition and self-identification. Following this point of view, the article attempts to define Rorty's position in the "Nomad - Ironist" range. Rorty, who began his philosophical activity as an adherent of analytic philosophy, later became an adherent of continental philosophy in the person of its various representatives. In addition, Rorty frequently changed his position on the same problems. " Tag" philosophy, based on external opinion or self-identification, serves an important function, simplifying the ways in which certain philosophical views are considered. But, first of all, it is necessary to identify the philosopher as a philosopher. We can argue as much as we like about who is closer to the truth, continental or analytic philosophers, but we primarily identify them as philosophers. Different philosophical positions offer different solutions, forms, and methods of discussing philosophical questions. The differences here are undoubtedly enormous. But the unity of philosophical knowledge is not set by the uniformity of solutions, which may be infinitely many, but by the unity of the questions belonging to the field of philosophy.

AB The article is devoted to the study of the phenomenon of mass organized adoption of Orthodoxy by the Czechs previously professing Catholicism, who stayed in Omsk during the First World War as prisoners of war. It cites the factors that jointly influenced, at first, mass group conversion of the Czechs to Orthodoxy in 1916-17, and later their indifference to the common Slavic idea and prompted their nationalism and "political egoism" during the Civil War in Russia. The study is based on the analysis of a complex of sources that have not yet been introduced into scientific use. These are the records from the Omsk Orthodox churches metric books (fairly well preserved in the Historical Archive of the Omsk Region) and materials from the official periodical Omsk Diocesan Vedomosti. The high relevance of the publication springs from poor coverage of religious life of the prisoners of World War I in Western Siberia in historiography. Taking into account the specifics of the study, the authors have used integrated methodological approach based on a combination of theory of social adaptation and anthropological approach, as well as statistical, biographical, and problem-chronological methods. This theoretical complex permits to study and quite reasonably interpret the phenomenon, linking its appearance with concrete historical situation and personalities. The authors contend that during the First World War proselytism was a cover for geopolitical interests of the Russian Empire, and spiritual aspiration of most Czechs to Orthodoxy was a propaganda myth created by the Russian Orthodox Church. The publication may be of interest to researchers of the peoples of Eastern Europe, military and social history, national and religious politics.

AB The global decarbonisation policy, growing availability of alternative energy sources and, subsequently, intensified competition in the global energy market increase the risks for coal suppliers, including Russia, the world's third largest exporter of this fuel. Based on the author's database on coal projects in Asian Russia, policy documents for the fuel and energy sector development and forecasts of global fuel consumption, the study presents the development outlook of the Russian coal industry up to 2040. The scenarios took into consideration the decarbonisation rate, features of the energy transition and implementation costs. As a result, optimistic, baseline and pessimistic scenarios were created. The baseline scenario assumes that the global decarbonisation rate will be reduced and coal energy will be present in the energy balance for at least twenty years. The implementation of this scenario should be accompanied by a radical increase in labour productivity, technological modernisation of the main production processes, the launch of advanced coal processing enterprises, and achieved compliance with international environmental standards. At the same time, the export orientation of Russian coal projects, primarily to the Asia-Pacific market, will remain. This situation will stimulate transport infrastructure development in Siberia and the Russian Far East, positively affect the integrated socio-economic development of Asian territories and improve the quality of life of the population, contributing to the stability of the political and economic system. The findings can be used to assess the investment impulse of large development projects in Asian Russia.

DT Article
DE Korelsky county; Northwestern Ladoga area; Russian Orthodox Church;
   church parish; parochial system
AB The study is devoted to understanding the problem of the formation of the parochial system of the Korelsky district, which found itself in the 16th - early 17th centuries at the center of the political and ideological confrontation between the Swedish kingdom and the Muscovite kingdom. The novelty of the study lies in the fact that for the first time, based on a comprehensive analysis of all available sources, the total number of secular parishes and churches that functioned in the region in the late 1560s - late 1570s was clarified, and their localization on the map was carried out. A consistent comparison of the number of secular church parishes in three chronological sections - in the early 1500s, late 1560s late 1570s and early 1610s - made it possible to supplement the concept of transformation of the parish church system in the region that had developed in historiography and establish that the surge in church building that began in the 1540s continued until the end of the 1570s. It is shown that the construction of new temples developed unevenly: starting in the most populated volosts located along the coast of Lake Ladoga, it continued on the periphery. It is concluded that thanks to the purposeful policy of the Church, with the support of local elites, the Orthodox faith and culture have firmly established themselves among the laity, which played a key role in the fate of the Karelian borderlands.

DE factors of destabilization; threats of increased social tension;
   situational and long-term risks; regional security; Rostov region;

AB Introduction. The article examines traditional and recent factors that affect the situation in the geopolitically significant southern Russian region. The reasons for the actualization of socio-political and ethno-confessional conflicts are considered as factors of possible regional destabilization. Methods and materials. Conflictological diagnostics of the regional tension dynamics, as well as the nature and features of situational and long-term risks to regional security and socio-political stability in the South of Russia are based on factor analysis of Rostov region, Krasnodar Krai, and the Republic of Adygea materials. Analysis. By analyzing the statistics, the authors has revealed the presence of such negative processes in these regions as a decrease in the standard of living, a sharp increase in the unemployment rate, an increase in corruption and crime rates, population decrease, which is provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic - the newest factor of regional tension. Results. It is concluded that socio-economic problems against the background of a pandemic crisis may adversely affect the nature of interethnic and interfaith relations. Competition in the labor market, deterioration of the criminal situation, and uncontrolled migration can be considered as factors of conflict. According to the results of the study, it was found that the destabilization factors of the Rostov region regional situation have an endogenous character: demographic (population decrease), economic (deterioration in the socio-economic situation of the population), growth of protest activity and destructive content in the media. For Krasnodar Krai and the Republic of Adygea, exogenous factors of regional tension remain relevant: there is a high level of external migration for the region. Authors' contribution. The contribution of M.V. Tarasova in writing the article is to form the research logic, develop methodology and tools, and analyze statistical information in Rostov region. The analysis of the regional situation in Krasnodar Krai and Rostov region was carried out by I. V. Yurchenko, and M.V. Dontsova.

TI CONGRUENCY AS A PARAMETER OF POLITICAL STABILITY
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE public governance; political stability; congruency; political culture
AB Despite the significant number of definitions of "stability" that can be found in contemporary political science, this problematic field, truly critical for applied research of contemporary public governance, is characterized, according to the author, by a lack of attention to improved sociological tools related to the citizens' assessment of the congruence of public governance and people's notion about the necessary format of the functioning of the latter. The author sees the key task of the current article to fill this gap and emphasizes that the study of political stability, understood as the legitimate state of the political system, in which its status actors within the framework of existing sustainable institutions are able to initiate and effectively implement the actions necessary for adaptive changes, requires attention not only to the formal and normative side of the activities of the main institutions and not only to the parameters of technical (economic) efficiency, but also to the population's views and perceptions of observable institutions, mechanisms and structures. In support of his own position, the author refers to the most significant and systematic scientific works devoted to political stability. Within the article, congruency is understood as the state of coherence and mutual acceptability of the institutions of the political system and the dominant elements of political culture. The author discusses the main problems related to the two presented concepts (including existing discussions on the interpretation of both "institutions" and "political culture"). The article emphasizes that, despite the long-standing informative ideas in modern science related to the consideration of congruence and incongruence, there are few applied techniques that could be used for the analysis of existing state systems - and, moreover, some of the approaches, in the theory devoted to the study of public trust and involvement, are already used by politicians in their own reputation and rating interests. In conclusion, the author presents possible tools for measuring congruency - sociological (1), quantitative (2) and a third approach, focusing on the study of attitudes towards separate institutions, perceived as key elements of political system.

SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE vestimentary code; semiotics of costume; semiotics of material culture;
   cultural text; language of culture; trope; socialist realism; Stalinism
AB The article examines major modes of costume as a trope in the cultural texts of high and late Stalinism, primarily in journalism and official literature. Successive changes in these modes can be traced through shifts in vestimentary semantics. As the analysis of the texts shows, each period in the history of Stalinism is characterized by one dominant costume trope. Schematically, the evolution of costume tropology in the second half of the 1930s - early 1950s. follows the trajectory: costume as a metaphor for achievements in the period of high Stalinism - costume as a metonymy of socialism in the period of late Stalinism.
   The thesis is argued that the history of the Stalinist discourse of fashion can and should be considered as a branch of cultural policy, since the evolution of the official rhetoric of fashion correlated with changes in the political agenda and formed a vestimentary projection of the power discourse. Despite the significant differences in costume semantics in different periods of Stalinism, a single axiological basis of the costume in Stalinist culture is revealed: a combination of the state pride and personal modesty. It is also concluded that in the years of high and late Stalinism, the costume and the institution of the official "Soviet fashion" functioned in culture according to the principles of socialist realism and were, in fact, one of its offshoots. In other words, the costume was not merely a cultural text, but a socialist realist text of Stalinist culture.

DT Article

   self-government of the nobility; elections of the nobility; M. M.
   Speransky
AB In historiography, the Russian constitutionalism of the first quarter of the nineteenth century has traditionally been considered a result of the ideological influence of the European political and legal theories and the content of foreign constitutions known to contemporaries. What escaped researchers' attention was the influence of the existing experience of holding elections in noble assemblies which the authors of constitutional projects referred to as a basic model for forming bodies of class representation. Electoral practices allowed the emperor and his immediate environment to estimate the degree of formation of one of the most significant conditions for introducing a constitution in Russia, i. e. the fact that the eligible for political rights possessed necessary moral qualities, desire, and abilities for partnership in the development and discussion of laws. The author analyses archival materials from the Russian State Historical Archive, acts, and M. M. Speransky's private correspondence with V. P. Kochubey. For the first time in national historiography, the article presents recurring problem situations deemed by contemporaries as critical, interfering with the normal functioning of election systems. The most significant of them was the impossibility to draw up electoral lists in due time and authentically, reveal and prevent facts of a deliberate distortion of data on property, cases of false purchase and sale of manors; lack of the necessary number of noblemen who would correspond to all to the criteria established by the law and have the skills required; conspiracy or bribery of electors by the persons interested in the victory of a candidate; cases of "evasion of duty" by already elected candidates. Such cases were treated as a manifestation of unworthy behaviour of noblemen who turned the election procedure into an instrument of negative selection of candidates. Finally, the author concludes that in the government circles of Russia in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, together with the understanding of the inefficiency of the existing local management system, the negative experience of electoral practices was an argument for the inopportuneness of introducing a constitution.

DT Article
DE Brazil's diplomacy; foreign policy traditions; peacefulness; the
   Olavists; the military; internal crisis
AB The article compares Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro diplomacy with the traditional one and explains in what terms and why his foreign policy is different from a classical approach.
   Before he came to power, such principles as peaceful coexistence with neighbors, aspiration for national grandeur, peaceful conflict settlement and independent decision making were inherent in Brazilian diplomacy. Today the country's foreign policy is unpredictable, inconsistent, and far from traditional peacefulness. Before changes in the US administration in 2021, Bolsonaro, as well as many of his predecessors, bet on the USA to solve national problems. Unilateral concessions to Washington predictably gave no results and lowered Brazilian independence in decision making. The USA was not interested in strengthening its rival in Latin America, no matter how friendly the relations between the two countries were. Bolsonaro's policy is influenced by different lobby groups with opposing interests in government agencies. An important role is played by the military and followers of the theoretician Olavo de Carvalho. Paying attention to each of these groups, Bolsonaro implements an inconsistent foreign policy and runs a risk of not putting important political projects into practice and of finding himself in an international isolation.
   The changes in foreign policy take place amidst political and economic crisis in Brazil. Coronavirus pandemic aggravated the conflict of the branches of power. To strengthen his positions, the president appeals to the population, looks for support in the Parliament and pushes through an administrative bill aimed at making the president more autonomous in managing the executive branch structures.
   The appearance of the "right-wing" president and powerful influence of the conservative military stem from the economic and political crisis in Brazil, and Bolsonaro's ''special" governance style fits a worldwide trend of populism and active politics coverage in social networks.

AB This article develops the concept introduced in "The digital socio-political agenda and its conceptualization within the new media ecology framework (Polis. Political Studies. 2022. No. 2). The model of the digital socio-political agenda is described through two dimensions ("Official discourse" and "Network discourse"), which result through their constant interaction in the production of a new digital socio-political agenda, in which the state and traditional media are no longer the undisputed leaders. The article presents the results of the testing of the theoretical model of the digital socio-political agenda developed by the authors on the empirical data of the Coronavirus case on social networks Twitter and Facebook* and in all publications of the largest news agencies of the Russian Federation in the period from March 18 to September 19, 2020. The resulting datasets (1 million 900 thousand messages for the keyword "coronavirus" (and its variations) and 760 thousand users who used the words/phrases "coronavirus" in these social networks; 10 thousand publications by RIA Novosti, TASS, "Interfax" for the keyword "coronavirus") were subjected to network, relational and linguo-discursive analysis. The authors come to the conclusion that the factors influencing the sustainability and effectiveness of the digital socio-political agenda are: firstly, the presence or absence of polarization of the "Users" network; secondly, mutual embedding, penetration or dominance of pro-government and opposition discourses; thirdly, the value of the weight of interlevel interactions between the " Official discourse" dimension and the " Network discourse" dimension. During the testing of the model, the following strategies for the formation of discursive fields in the digital socio-political agenda, typical for pro-government and opposition structures, as well as for online influencers, were identified and detailed: a strategy for involving new users; pragmatic modeling strategy; a strategy of whipping up panic and forming a negative attitude towards official power (typical of opposition structures); a strategy of discursive hibernation; a strategy of discursive diffusion; an advance strategy (typical of pro-government structures). The presence of multidirectional vectors in the digital socio-political agenda, especially in crisis and emergency situations, does not allow stabilizing the socio-political system and mobilizing the civilian population for constructive socio-political practices both online and offline.

DT Article
DE Adyghes; Shapsugs; natukhians; abadzekhs; social system
AB The question of the peculiarities of the social institutions of the Shapsugs, Natukhais and Abadzekhs - three groups of Circassians is considered. The relevance of the study is due to the fact that this problem is of interest for Caucasian studies and for solving theoretical problems of history and ethnography. The novelty of the work is seen in the use of archival documents, introduced into scientific circulation for the first time and in a new interpretation of already known sources. It is proved that some features of the social structure of these groups developed in those times when they lived in the mountains and had the opportunity not to submit to the power of the princes. It is shown that other features were the result of social conflicts at the end of the 18th - the first half of the 19th centuries. The question is raised about the reasons for the victory of the peasantry in these conflicts. It is noted that these include kinship and community solidarity as well as the widespread distribution of firearms. Particular attention is paid to such social institutions of the Shapsugs, Natukhais and Abadzekhs as "brotherhoods" based on consanguinity and on the oath of mutual assistance. Their role in the consolidation of the peasantry and the strengthening of its influence is revealed. It is argued that thanks to the "brotherhoods" the number and territory of these three groups greatly expanded. The author also reveals the role of rural communities and their unions at different levels in the political system.

AB The main purpose of the article is to analyze the nuclear non-proliferation policy of the United States governments of Richard Nixon and Jerald Ford, and its influence on the leading countries of Western Europe in 1969-1975. This research is based on the published documents in the collection "Foreign Relations of the United States", electronic archives of the National Security Archive and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (both in the Washington DC), debates in the UK parliament and Bundestag of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). At the beginning of the article, the author has described the main steps of the American diplomacy in the field of nuclear control, especially in relations to the countries of Western Europe. The paper briefly examines the transformation of U.S. nuclear policy from the Acheson - Lilienthal Report of 1946 till the conclusion of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NTP) in 1968. Then, the article analyzes the activities of the governments of France, Britain and the Federal Republic of Germany in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. The paper traces diplomatic contacts between the leading countries of Western Europe and the United States on the issue of signing and ratifying the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The author has paid special attention to relationships between Bonn and Washington. West Germany, with her significant position in NATO and huge strategic, economic and political potential, was one of the main targets of the U.S. non-proliferation policy. The article considers the problem of the NTP ratification by Italy and Germany. The internal disputes in the political circles of the FRG on signing and ratifying the NPT ate analyzed. The author also has attracted attention to the problem of the implementation of the NPT by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. The main conclusions of the article are the following. First, Chancellor W. Brandt by promoting ratification of the NPT has achieved success in his New Eastern Policy. Second, despite the limitation of nuclear potential of NATO, the non-proliferation policy contributed to integration of the countries of Western Europe. Third, German participation in the NPT was influenced by the actions of Paris and London. British diplomats motivated the West German leadership for the early signing of the NPT. By contrast, Paris disagreed with US non-proliferation policy. French position could stimulate an alternative approach to the nuclear non-proliferation in the FRG.

AB Social media have been firmly entrenched in the modern eve-ryday life. Still, their influence on the formation of public opinion is not well understood. An important feature of social media is that they are not neutral. Not only do people interact with each other on social media platforms, but social media themselves actively interact with people, selecting personalized content for them based on the information about their interests and behavior. In 2011, Eli Pariser hypothesized that content personalization should lead to the formation of a kind of "information cocoons", or "filter bubbles" - ho-mogeneous groups of users who hold similar views. However, the fragmen-tation of the Internet community into "filter bubbles" is not the only threat posed by the use of personalization algorithms. Even more dangerously, social media possess the ability to manipulate content selection algorithms in order to influence users' views.

DT Article

AB The article analyzes the formation and development of the legal foundations of the UK sanctions policy. Based on the principles of Realpolitik, the concept of "Sanctions Policy" is studied not as an academic construction but as a real political and legal tool for the implementation of the external functions of the English state. The article proposes a brief historical and legal review of the sanctions legislation evolution, starting with the Royal Decree of 1621, the Navigation Act (1651), the Stamp Act (1765), the Townshend Acts (1767) and ending with the sanctions legislation of the EU, where the UK was a member before Brexit. The focus is on a detailed analysis of the Law on Sanctions and Combating Money Laundering of 2018, as well as statutory instruments, including the Regulations on Sanctions for Chemical Weapons (2019) and the Regulations on Sanctions for Violations of Human Rights (2020).
   Since the UK legal system belongs to the system of case law, the authors attempted to analyze the most important court decisions in this area, including: the case of HM Treasury v. Ahmed (2010) and Vekselberg, better known as Lamesa Investments Limited v. Cynergy Bank Limited (2019).
   It is concluded that the UK's sanctions policy is primarily aimed at the achievement of its geopolitical objectives.

AB During the Northern War (1700-1721), the Russian government had to make great efforts to strengthen the anti-Swedish coalition. Peter the Great developed a broad foreign network of state representatives: employees of the diplomatic corps (envoys, ministers, residents, agents, etc.), trade commissioners, and correspondents. Peter the Great himself, his Cabinet, and the foreign policy department (Posolsky Prikaz, Collegia lnostrannykh Del) controlled these agents of influence. Peter's diplomats fought for symbolic capital by taking part in official negotiations and unofficial meetings, in diplomatic and court ceremonies, in gift-exchanging, and organizing various festivities. This capital then was converted into the international prestige of the ruler, his title, honor, glory, and position in the hierarchy of European rulers. Considerable attention was paid to promptly inform Western partners about events in Russia's foreign and domestic policy. Russian information policy emphasized the news that can strengthen Russia's international prestige: dynastic, diplomatic, and military successes, political reforms, and court celebrations.The article examines the practice of news dissemination through Russian diplomatic missions and foreign diplomatic representatives in Russia. The practice reduced the negative effect of the spread of unofficial information, fake news, and false rumors. The war continued in the pages of print media.To limit the dissemination of information damaging Russia's prestige, Russian diplomats began to use the same instruments of influence (newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets), which European diplomats used at that time: various methods of pressure and bribery, propaganda, and censorship. The successes of Russian diplomacy have led to the strengthening of Russia's international prestige and contributed to creating a positive image of the country abroad. The Russian government transferred the gained experience into domestic policy. Peter the Great also demanded fighting against "reprehensible" information about "the person of his majesty, or his troops, as well as his state."

AB The paper provides an analysis of the main ideas of the article by S.Yu Glazyev "Russia is fighting for the preservation of mankind" (newspaper Zavtra, April 6, 2022), in which an important, actually central place is occupied by reflections on the role and significance of social consciousness and state ideology. However, the article pays little attention to the questions of WHO embodies the struggle, WHO the bearer of social consciousness is, and WHOSE INTERESTS should be expressed by the state ideology in modem Russia. In accordance with this goal, an analysis of the role of social consciousness in the historical destinies of peoples, the place and role of state ideology is carried out. The characteristics of the main classes and communities (strata) in modern Russian society and their worldview attitudes and orientations are given. Particular attention is paid to the precariat, which, in the author's opinion, determines the face of modem Russian society. The conclusion is substantiated that worldview, ideological positions are not only a part of public life, but a certain penetrating component that concerns not only culture, but also all spheres of economic, social and political activity.

   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE subject; subjectivity; self; ethics; moral concern
AB The article discusses a problem that straddles normative ethics and metaethics. This problem is the domain of moral judgment. My first thesis is that moral rules are meaningful only in a world where subjects, or selves, exist. In a world where there are no subjects (however we define a subject), or in a world where there is only one subject, ethics is impossible. The argument for the thesis is that moral rules can only be instantiated in the form of judgments that include terms referring to (1) subjects, or (2) subjects' interests (such as survival, avoiding suffering, happiness and the good life). If this condition is not met, then moral judgments lack their domain. It follows that the existence of other subjects is a necessary (but maybe not sufficient) condition for making any moral judgment, and hence for moral philosophy. My second thesis is that the definition of subject ought to be a fundamental issue for ethics. To define subject means to set necessary and sufficient conditions, on the basis of which we can determine the truth of any proposition of the type x is a subject for any thing x. This definition determines what kind of creatures we include in our moral concerns. Finally, I briefly discuss various models of subjectivity: biographical, self-conscious, perspectival and minimal-experiential subjectivity. Biographical subjects (i.e. most people) are able to combine elements of knowledge about themselves into more or less coherent causal sequences - biographical narratives. I raise the problem of the criterion on the basis of which people tend to arrange different subject-types into the hierarchy of moral concern. Elements of subject-types low on the hierarchy are either denied moral concern or treated as secondary therein. My hypothesis is that it happens on the basis of species-similarity (based on shared biological characteristics or belonging to the same species) and/or subjectivity-similarity (based on belonging to the same subject-type). As biographical subjects, we believe that we must first and foremost take care of other biographical subjects; as members of the species H.s. we must care about its other members. If that is true it is unclear why the shared subject-type serves as the basis for justifiable moral concern. How can similarity be justified as a criterion for moral concern? I conclude that moral concern on the bases of species-similarity and/or subjectivity-similarity is devoid of explicit philosophical justification.

DE Rorty; Smirnov; hermeneutics; interpretation; fear of influence
AB The article presents a commentary on Sergey Smirnov's review of my book on the philosophy of Richard Rorty. When considering the evolution of views - from relativism, the "assimilation" of the historian of science Thomas Kuhn, the "adaptation" of the continental thinkers Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida to the hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer of the "landmark beacons" noted by Smirnov, I have added another one, namely, the "fear of influence" by Harold Bloom. A number of examples are shown of how Rorty's overcoming of such influence can be presented as a way of identifying both Rorty himself and his philosophy. A striking example of Rorty's efforts to avoid being " secondary" is his attitude to the work of Kuhn, who deals with the history of physics, while Rorty deals with philosophical discourse. Rorty tried to avoid this dilemma by resorting to attempts to combine these discourses, but without accepting the accepted hierarchy of sciences, in which philosophy occupies a subordinate place. It is for these reasons that Rorty escaped from the influence of Kuhn, after which he is characterized by great ambitions, since he speaks on behalf of cultural policy, which Rorty calls "philosophy". An even more striking example of how Rorty overcomes his "secondariness" is given. It is Gadamer's and Heidegger's influence on Rorty, and his acceptance of hermeneutics instead of epistemology. Rorty's demonstrative preference for hermeneutic conversations in this spirit of argumentation in an epistemological way demonstrated the obvious secondary nature of Rorty. Feeling this burden, Rorty tries to get rid of the fear of influence. A new understanding of his goals requires new arguments from Rorty, already directed against hermeneutics. He finds them in Donald Davidson's polemic with Charles Taylor. The fact is that Rorty discards the old concept of interpretation, "inscribed on the banners of the philosophical movement" represented by Dilthey, Gadamer, and Taylor, replacing it with a more subtle concept of "recontextualization". Thus, there can be no " total", or, as Rorty says, universal hermeneutics!

DE Mongolia; Russian as a foreign language; language situation;

AB The results of a study conducted in 2021 and devoted to the analysis of the current position of the Russian language in Mongolian society is presented in the article. The relevance of the study is due to the need to analyze the changes taking place in the minds of the Mongols regarding the Russian language, and to search for further prospects for its functioning in Mongolia. The impossibility of conducting a mass questionnaire survey due to the pandemic of a new coronavirus infection led to the choice of an expert survey as the main research method. The factors leading to the weakening of the Russian language positions, which include, first of all, the change in Mongolia's foreign policy priorities, the search for new partners, the decrease in Russia's influence, and the processes of globalization are considered in the article. It was revealed that, despite the narrowing of the spheres of functioning of the Russian in Mongolia, its socio-cultural potential in the Mongolian society has not been exhausted. The factors restraining the growth of negative trends are highlighted, namely the presence of the Russian in the educational sphere, the presence of specialists with Soviet and Russian education, a common historical memory based on friendship and trust. Analysis of the results of the study shows that the further development of cooperation between Russia and Mongolia in all spheres of public life, the strengthening of political union, economic cooperation and cultural interaction can allow the Russian language to become one of the leading foreign languages in modern Mongolian society.

DE science policy; institution; science development; control; trust;

AB This article is a response to Ilya T. Kasavin's "When the future borders on utopia: science in perspective". The article deals with the problem of coordinating the two contours of science - internal (scientific research) and external (institutional infrastructure). The main thesis is that the mismatch is associated with a conflict on the outer contour between the long-term and local goals of the development of science. So, in the case of Russian science, the long-term goal is associated with reaching the "world level" of scientific results and the advancement of the scientific frontier. This goal requires a long time, which will allow scientists to gain the necessary experience to publish articles in high-ranking journals. In addition, the emergence of science to new frontiers implies the openness of the academic community to the global world. The author believes that the achievement of this goal requires the preservation of a fictitious institutional framework that retains the possibility for spontaneous self-organization of the community and open competition of ideas. At the same time, local goals (control over the effectiveness of scientific work over short time periods) encourage the status quo to be maintained in science. The negative effect of increasing formal control over scientists leads to the strengthening of mutual distrust between scientists and the authorities. On the one hand, "institutionalized suspicion" is cultivated, which consists in the presumption of bad faith of agents. On the other hand, the pressure of ineffective rules reduces the credibility of the institution and encourages avoidance of their implementation. Such an institutional policy creates a kind of "trap", which leads to the establishment of a norm that does not meet anyone's interests. The author believes that the strengthening of bureaucratic pressure on science is associated with the influence of the ideas of post-positivism. The post-positivist desacralization of science had at least two external effects - denialism (distrust of expert knowledge) and oversimplification of the politics of science. The author shows that in order to compensate for these negative effects, we need a new "myth about science". This "myth" aims at establishing trust as a key value of science policy, which is beneficial not only for science, but also for society as a whole. It would free up significant resources (human, intellectual, material), which are now being spent on ineffective control.

AB This article discusses the electoral system existing in the Russian Federation. Some problematic points in the regulation of electronic campaigning are revealed; examples from the practice of the elections of deputies of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of the Eighth Convocation held in 2021 are given. The article analyzes Federal Law 43-FZ of 09 March 2021, which paved the way for the start of a large-scale discussion of the need to regulate electronic electoral processes and electronic campaigning. The field of information and communication technologies is in dynamic development, and the legislator is not always able to timely and rationally respond to emerging technological innovations. As a result, there are numerous violations of the current legislation by various participants in the electoral process, the use of "dirty" electoral technologies and political technological mechanisms to influence civil choice. A speedy development of legislation in the field of "electronic campaigning" is required. It is well known that many social processes go online. Various electoral and political processes are no exception, and, given the rapid development of social networks and instant messengers, we can get an almost uncontrolled, unregulated "battlefield" for participants in electoral processes. This, in general, can have an extremely destructive effect on public choice and the political structure of the country. A legitimate transfer of power, which is a direct expression of citizens' will, should not be exposed to one or another risk associated with gaps in legislation or rapid development of social trends, tendencies, and modern technologies. It is the dynamic development of the Internet and various electronic services that has become the point of reference for the active expansion of the electoral system into the virtual space; during each campaign, new political technologies are used.

DT Article
DE sociocultural foundations of politics; soft power; separatist conflict;
   Catalonia; Scotland; national identity
AB The article explores soft power role in separatist conflicts in Catalonia and Scotland. The objective of the study is to analyze the features of the use of soft power by pro-independence forces and by the supporters of state unity and territorial integrity in selected regions. The theoretical background of the study includes issue-related works of Russian and foreign researchers. The methodological basis of the study consists of different research approaches and methods, among them: the sociocultural approach (when the sociocultural determinants of the impact on the political sphere of society are considered), the institutional and sociological approaches (in the study of actors of the socio-political process), the method of combining sociological and institutional paradigms, as well as the general logical, factual and comparative methods of political science. The authors hold that independence supporters build up soft power more actively than their opponents. A key purpose of its application by separatists is to strengthen the national identity of the people seeking to acquire national and territorial sovereignty. The article shows that the pattern of the soft power tools in Catalonia and Scotland arise from the specifics of the national identity of the Catalans and the Scots respectively. The authors identified objectively established strong sociocultural preconditions for the use of soft power by Catalan and Scottish separatists. The research findings contribute to the theory of soft power and to search for ways to address separatist conflicts.

AB The study aims to analyze the network structure of trade relations in 38 countries and is based on data from the World Trade Organization. The popular concept of digitalization drives the focus of the study on technology trade. Comparative logic is implemented by analyzing networks for two time periods: 2013 and 2019. The analysis of trade networks of countries allows resolving the existing contradiction about the impact of international trade on the institutions' transplantation. On the one hand, it argues that international trade enhances the transplantation of institutions and leads to democratization. On the other, it claims that authoritarian regimes can apply and develop technologies without exposing their own regime to change threats. As a result, it was established that the autocracies occupied positions similar to those of democracies in both periods. The Russian Federation occupies a leading position in the network structure of trade relations. There is no isolating attitude towards autocracies; moreover, a regime practically does not play a role in trade relations. Over the past six years, the countries' positions in trade relations have not changed despite a radical change in the political discourse regarding the Russian Federation and China. The results of the network analysis allowed mapping the international technology trade landscape. Authoritarian states are not "outcasts" but rather active participants in international trade relations without exposing the internal authoritarian regime to threats (the regime's adaptation and the stability of authoritarian institutions). In other words, "business is business" despite the regime differences. Another assumption of the study was that the transplanting process of authoritarian institutions is more successful than that of democratic institutions. This assumption requires an independent and more detailed study in the future. However, it has an empirical basis and looks promising in the context of the explanatory power of modern political processes in different countries.

DE naturalistic theories of consciousness; ontological status of
   consciousness; epistemological pluralism; "non-reductive naturalism"
AB When studying the phenomenon of consciousness, we are always forced to proceed from certain prerequisites that have an inevitable impact on the theory of consciousness itself. Obviously, the key disagreement is monism (in its materialistic version), or dualism in relation to consciousness. I believe that in order to resolve the issue of consciousness, it is also necessary to determine its ontological and epistemological status. If we take the position of materialism or naturalism in relation to consciousness, then further we need to recognize consciousness as a separate entity ( which leads to dualism), or deny it. I think that consciousness without a brain is devoid of an independent ontological status and can rather be considered within the whole "brain-consciousness." Consciousness is a property of living beings (or other information systems), which in some way manifests itself in their behavior. At the same time, the epistemological status of consciousness cannot be unambiguous, and an approach called epistemological or cognitive pluralism (Sven-Ove Horst's term) is applicable here: the scientific study of consciousness from the point of view of the third person does not deny the view from the first person - direct access to consciousness, which each of us has. These are different ways of describing the same complex of phenomena, and they should complement each other, incorporating both scientific and everyday ideas about consciousness, taking into account its subjective, phenomenal status, its irreducible "qualitative" nature. It is important to reckon the fact that the very language we use when we speak about consciousness, and the whole range of problems associated with it, was once invented, but now scientific reality itself has changed and, perhaps, other, more adequate concepts are needed to describe it. Daniel Dennett wrote a lot about this; his views on consciousness are considered by many to be eliminativist. Another interesting approach to consciousness is "non-reductive naturalism," which considers consciousness as a natural phenomenon, but does not reduce it to a material basis. Among the representatives of this trend is Lynne Rudder Baker. I adhere to the position of biological naturalism: consciousness acts as a natural result of the development of the brain, which appeared in the course of evolution. Consciousness itself does not have independence, but this phenomenon is so complex and multifaceted that we cannot give the only correct description of it.

   psychophysical problem
AB The authors state that in its main ontological and semantic parameters philosophical anthropology dominating the discourse of modern philosophy and being taught in leading European and Russian educational institutions was developed by the ancient classics, and mainly by European Christian philosophers. It has a specific historical source - the scholastic Christian world outlook. Modern interpretations of human existence are direct or indirect consequences of solving the key question for scholasticism about the knowledge of God, which is expressed in the teachings of nominalism and realism, and predetermined the specificity of subsequent anthropological thought. In the Western philosophical and anthropological tradition, it manifests itself in three ontological characteristics - pantheism, rationalism, naturalism. The authors emphasize that rationalism was an external all-embracing methodological form of scholastic thinking. The principal thing is that according to both nominalism and realism, the distinction between divine (uncreated) and created being is not made consistently: the ontological status of the connection between the human and the divine is clarified rationally. For anthropology this fact is of importance, assuming the essential, existential position of a person in his ultimate boundaries to be unclear. Nominalism declaring the theory of "two truths", methodological dualism, ontological division assumes the faith (the basic mode of human existence) to be either in submission to reason, or as something absolutely sacred. The realistic tradition equates ontologically human thinking with the nature of God. Such an anthropological approach assumes rationalistic self-confidence, uncriticality, subjectivity, spiritual imposture, as well as pantheism, and abolishes the ontological vertical. The authors approve that the idealism of realistic philosophy provokes the flowering of a reverse anthropological position - naturalism, an evolutionary explanation of anthropogenesis with the related ideas of the human existence transitivity and its semantic picture historicity.

During the Genoa Conference of 1922, it was planned to build the world on new conditions, to include socialist Russia in the structure of international relations, but to force it to return the enterprises nationalized by the Soviet government to the West beforehand or to compensate for their cost. In order to obtain Western loans, it was important to achieve international recognition, to get out of isolation. The authors show how it became possible to break through the isolation ring, conclude a peace treaty with Germany with all the difference in potentials, ideologies, and life values of the two countries.

AB Russia and the Baltic States have a long-standing relationship of industrial specialisation, cooperation, division of labour and trade exchange, all dating back to the Soviet Union. Today, this relationship is facing a tough test amid political and ideological challenges and risks. The last two years have seen a profound and large-scale crisis caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the production linkages between Russia and the Baltic States have adapted in response to the existing problems, remaining resistant to the geopolitical and pandemic shocks. This article examines the production linkages between Russia and the Baltic countries, investigating the export-import flows of consumer and intermediate goods in 2003-2020. A comparative study of the Baltic States' production linkages with Russia and their main partners in the EU - Germany and Finland - is carried out. It is concluded that, before the introduction of sanctions in 2014 and the world trade crisis of 2015-2016, Russia was a more promising market than Germany and Finland for the Baltic States' companies trading in intermediate goods.

AB The article deals with the main directions of Max Scheler's philosophy, whose contribution to the development of the theory of knowledge and personality can hardly be overestimated. The author of the article aims to consider a most important part in the theory of knowledge - contemplation of the religious and moral knowledge in Scheler's philosophy. That would be impossible without a prior consideration of his basic principles in aforementioned fields because Scheler's philosophical theory is highly complicated: it links closely personality, knowledge, religion, and all these directions lead to Scheler's phenomenology, which basically differs from Husserl's phenomenological theory. A very special way of knowledge - religious cognition - has been investigated. Aiming at that, the author deals first of all with the principal categories of Scheler's philosophical thinking. These are: cognition of entities and their connections in the world, constitution of the human personality, formation of religion and faith, as well as the image of God. All these spheres of human being are inextricably linked in Scheler's new anthropological theory, which he called the "emerging anthropology" (German: werdende Anthropologic). A complex approach allowed the author to state an indissoluble unity of a big conglomerate of philosophical problems in anthropology, axiology, ethics, phenomenology. Nowadays, a rethinking of human destiny would be highly important in the face of the collapse of classical values, which Scheler was pointing at a century ago. Researchers may be interested in Scheler's idea of priority of a human' emotional sphere over the rational one. This could bring tangible results in the explanation of many radical processes happening now in the system of values and in the moral and ethical sphere of personality.

TI THE ROMANTIC ORIGINS OF ODOEVSKY'S PEDAGOGICAL IDEAS: ON THE QUESTION OF
   SENSUAL AND RATIONAL COGNITION

DE V.F. Odoevsky; Romanticism; philosophy of education; sensual cognition;
   rational cognition
AB In this article I analyze the pedagogical ideas of V.F. Odoevsky in their connection with the Romantic ideas about the world and man. The main interest for me here is the connection between the sensual and rational aspects in the process of cognition. Despite the impossibility of a direct comparison of ideas, it is possible to draw parallels through the question of cognition and the concept of education as it was understood by the Romantics (Novalis in particular) and as it is presented and realized in the pedagogical works of V.F. Odoevsky.
   The influence of Romanticism on Odoevsky can be summarized in the following points:
   1) in the outlook, associated with the focus on the individual characteristics of man and child in the pedagogical process. Romanticism actualized in the history of thought the value of the individual. The concrete man and the phenomena of his being become more and more often a material for philosophical research. The focus on the human being increases its value, as well as the need to actualize the individual characteristics of each individual. In connection with this worldview approach, the view of education is also shifting.
   The goal of preschool education according to Odoevsky is related to the formation and preparation of the apparatus of thinking, which he calls the "spiritual apparatus". The formation of understanding in a child is the possibility of manifestation of the individual in him.
   2) in the understanding that education is self-education in the first place. Odoevsky appeals in many ways to the independence of the child. Indeed, if education is perceived as a transfer of knowledge, it will turn out that the child will always be in a dependent position on the teacher without the skill of forming ideas and the desire to analyze and compare facts independently. In Novalis this aspect is expressed in that "without perfect self-understanding a true understanding of others cannot be achieved".
   3) in the understanding of the correlation between the rational and the sensual in the process of cognition. Despite the lack of obvious continuity between Odoevsky's pedagogical ideas and the Romantics, one can trace the Romantic source of his reflections: following the Romanticists, he reflects on the theme of thinking and feeling. However, if Romanticism strove to overcome the Enlightenment dictate of thinking, putting sensibility in the foreground, Odoevsky goes further and does not try to think them in opposition. This is indicated by his pedagogical position on the development of thinking in the period of the prevalence of emphasized sensuality in human life, in the period of childhood.

ID LEAGUE
AB The article attempts to find out the reasons for the failure of the collective security system in Europe, developed to counter German revisionism in the second half of the 1920s - early 1930s. Research literature tends to consider collective security not just as a diplomatic tool, but as a quality of international system developed after the First World War based on the idea of indivisible security with universal international organization presiding over it to deal with problems of war and peace. The principle of the balance of power and war itself as a means of international politics thus lost their legitimacy.
   Historians agree that the system proved unsuitable for the challenges of the early 1930s, demonstrated by the Ethiopian War and the Rhineland Crisis. Two alternative ways eventually developed to deal with the inconsistences of the early collective security system: "appeasement" project, initiated by British diplomacy; and the Soviet idea of military-political deterrence through coalition building. Modern historiography views "appeasement" as the idea presupposing the creation of a European Directory, which would have taken on the functions of resolving international contradictions. Historians see the reasons for its failure in an incorrect assessment of Hitler's policy due to thinking in the spirit of collective security. The position of the USSR is more contested among historians. In recent works, however, there appears the consensus that the reason for the failure of the project of a military-political alliance aimed at containing Germany was the unwillingness of the West to strategic interaction with Moscow and its adherence to the principles of "new diplomacy" at a time when it already lost their relevance.

AB The subject of the article is the political values of the youth of Russia and Europe. The purpose of our study is to identify the political values of the Youth of Russia and Europe and conduct a comparative analysis based on the methodology of comparative analysis. Four hypotheses are tested that suggest the values of young people, regardless of the region or country of residence, are common, despite the differences in forms of government, political culture, living standards and traditions of the respondents. The main research tasks were: 1. Identification of common value orientations of modern youth studying at universities. 2. Determination of the type of cultural mentality (according to the methodology of Russian American sociologist Pitirim Sorokin) of the youth of Russia and European countries included in the sample. 3. Determining the place of politics and the opportunity to participate in policymaking in the system of values of today's youth. 4. Identification of attitudes (loyalty / acceptance / non-acceptance) to modern democratic values, as well as identification of the preferred form of political governance among young people. 5. Determination of the desired type of taxation. 6. Establishing the relationship between political values and quality of life. 7. Determining the understanding of the components of happiness (wellbeing) and the meaning of life of modern youth. 8. Diagnosis of the degree of involvement in politics/apathy of today's youth.
   The main results, scope of application. Study made it possible to introduce into contemporary science a new term "integral model of values" - an interconnected set of several life values of a person, each of which describes individual components of values, to form a complete and comprehensive idea of the value system of certain social groups. Empirical study made it possible to identify the basic components of the integral model of values of modern youth in Russia and Europe in a comparative aspect. Under the integral model of values, authors mean an interconnected set of several private value models of a person (mentality, basic human and social values, life satisfaction and a subjective feeling of happiness, political views and actions, cultural values, etc.), each of which describes individual components of values, and all together they form a complete and comprehensive idea of the value system of certain social groups. In the structure of the integral model of youth values, authors included: mentality, political values, political mobility and a system of universal values. In accordance with this structure, we present the results of our study.
   8. Conclusions. Authors not only managed to identify the already established values and, on the basis of them, draw up an integration model of the values of the youth of Russia and Europe through their comparison, but also to determine the needs of today's youth for cer- tain values.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE justice; law; moral values; science; immanent; transcendent
AB This article analyzes justice as a category. Like all aspects of human activity, justice needs grounds that provide reliability. This article shows that in the history of human thinking, two approaches to comprehending the foundations of justice have been created. The first approach is based on recognition of the dominance of moral principles as the foundation for justice, and independence from empirical reality, political, social changes, and scientific discoveries. This is the independent path, which recognizes the independence of the fundamental principles of justice from facts. The second approach was formulated in the theory of justice by J. Rawls. He made an attempt to create a universal view of justice and was associated with the justification of justice by scientific theories created by scientists in political science, psychology, sociology, and other fields of knowledge. This approach was called dependent way, and its representatives consider justice to be a product of real society and recognize the consent of citizens as the basis of justice, in the normative life of society, giving preference to contractual relations. Both ways of solving the problem of the justice foundations have their strengths and weaknesses, but neither of them, taken separately, gives a satisfactory result. The experience of the Russian unity philosophy reveals a harmonious way to the solution of this problem. It shows that the foundation of justice is created by each individual personally, in condition that any person considers the circumstances of one's life through the prism of his spiritual nature. This process looks like a practical application of norms that are absolute in nature, while deviations and fluctuations are possible but in the end there is always a return to the original position. The authors call this position flexible transcendence.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the phenomenon of social apathy in the modern Russian realities. Despite the prevalence of the term "social apathy" in the assessment of the current state of the Russian so-ciety, there is still no consensus as to whether apathy boils down to rejection of the socio-political sphere or implies broader interpretations - the dominance in the society of an orientation towards minimizing activities, or even loss of faith in the value of the present day (except family and immediate relatives and friends).The key problems in using the concept of social apathy are the lack of a proven scientific methodology for applying the concepts of individual psy-chology to the collective, mass states, as well as the historically unambiguously negative attitude towards apathy as a vice, deviation, laziness, which makes it difficult to fully comprehend this phenomenon.The article outlines key approaches to explaining social apathy in the modern Russia, revealed in the course of the research project "The Phenom-enon of Social Mobilization as the Antipode of Social Apathy", carried out by the Petersburg Politics Foundation jointly with the "Insomar", the Insti-tute for Social Marketing, in the second half of 2021. Possible reasons for so-cial apathy include purposeful actions of the authorities, spontaneous reaction of citizens to the activities of politicians, anxiety about the future against the backdrop of the weak attractiveness of the present, the collapse of paternal-ism in the face of a shortage of tools and skills for living without the help of the state, and the unresolved internal conflicts. The authors reconstruct the main interpretations of the triggers of the current cycle of apathy, such as the economic changes of the 1990s, the failure of the "Medvedev thaw" and the pension reform of 2018, the consequences of which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.Based on the results of an expert survey and focus groups, the authors delineate hypothetical scenarios for overcoming social apathy and possible di-rections for the development of the public sentiments, and formulate a number of recommendations for managing political risks, taking into account possible social dynamics.

ID KEITH JENKINS
AB The article refers to the oeuvre of Keith Jenkins and Alun Manslow, whose names are associated with a program of reforming academic historiography that had a significant resonance. The author demonstrates that the ideas of these two authors have become widespread in academic circles and have long been considered potentially revolutionary due to the effective combination of topical theoretical demarches and academic practice that attracts young researchers seeking to move away from the ideologically charged tradition of historical writing. At the same time, the author explains the acceptance of the ideas professed by Jenkins and Munslow in the space of British historical science by a combination of two significant factors: firstly, a significant similarity of a number of postmodemist attitudes regarding discursive strategies and the historian's language in general, with the concepts of the "linguistic turn" and the activities authors such as H. White, and secondly, the political situation in Great Britain at the turn of the millennium, which provided fertile ground for the adoption of the "French theory". Explaining the reasons for the critical reaction to the theoretical and practical activities of Jenkins and Munslow in the last decade, the author puts forward the thesis about the implicit acceptance by British historical science of a number of attitudes introduced by them, which have become part of the theoretical discourse associated with tradition, showing that behind the rejection of those ideas that were propagated these authors, in fact, hides their partial assimilation, which opens up a new perspective in the history of historiography.

AB The main purpose of this article is to analyze whether agreement and disagreement expressed by participants in political discussions on social media influence the general process of political talk online and its outcome. This study also shows what nature of disagreement expressions prevails in political discussions on the second impeachment of D. Trump on Facebook platforms of politically polarized American mass media. The investigation is mainly based on concepts of deliberative democracy and public sphere formulated by J. Habermas, systemic approach to deliberative democracy proposed by J. Mansbridge. To achieve the goal of study, the authors use content analysis with such categories as opinion expression, interactivity, agreement and disagreement. The article concludes that agreement and disagreement expressed by participants in online conversation have no strong impact on the whole process and outcome of discussing on social media as their extents are minor, but they may influence inner processes of political talk online in different ways. As research revealed, there can be two ways: 1) a certain group of like-minded people is formed that allows to increase a level of interactivity and number of new participants in a discussion thread as people develop thoughts of each other by agreeing and adding new justifications; 2) two and more people with polarized opinions disagree with each other and attract more attention to their discussion thread that raises a level of interactivity. Disagreement in American online discussions on suggested theme can be characterized as more likely civil and justified rather than uncivil and unjustified. It means that such kind of disagreement does not have a destructive impact on political conversation and gives an opportunity for true and genuine deliberation.

DT Article
DE Russia; Spain; diplomatic relations; public diplomacy; science and
   education diplomacy
AB The article deals with the role of public diplomacy in Russian-Spanish relations; puts forward a hypothesis, that public diplomacy plays an independent role, sometimes even replacing traditional diplomacy, in the "political vacuum", when political ties between the two countries were frozen or even broken off. The author points out that some examples of public diplomacy can be traced in Russian-Spanish relations in the 18-19th centuries, but they transferred into state policy only in the 20th century. It was at that time that the Soviet government started to maintain a purposeful public policy aimed at "creating a positive image of the country" through the development of cultural and scientific contacts. This is demonstrated in the article on a number of examples: The October Revolution, which divided the world into two opposing blocs, in which there was no place for political relations; the period of Francoism, when both states publicly declared their irreconcilable ideological confrontation, but in fact were pragmatically building economic relations and strengthened scientific and cultural contacts. In those years, the personal support of prominent scientists and public figures played a huge role in building official diplomatic relations after the death of Franco. The author pays special attention to the role of the diplomacy of science and education, the importance of which. increased noticeably in the 21st century. From this point of view, the evolution of relations between Russia and Spain in the first quarter of this century is considered, especially during the period of cooling of relations as a result of the Ukrainian crisis.

AB Introduction. The article reviews the trajectory of international cooperation in the Western Hemisphere on the example of the case studies of Brazil-U. S. and Bolivia-U. S. bilateral relations, which experienced a significant change due to inner-political transformations in the countries. The main purpose of the study is to assess the degree of variability in the foreign policy, implemented by governments belonging to different political spectrum. Methods. The research is lined up on a comparison of the foreign policy of left governments of Luiz Inocio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff in Brazil and Evo Morales in Bolivia, as well as the shift to the "right" of the administrations of Michel Temer and Jeanine Bcez are in focus. The study also reveals the activities of the current administrations of Jair Bolsonaro (since 2019) in Brazil and Luis Arce (since 2020) in Bolivia. Analysis. Thus, orientation towards independence and aspiration to oppose Washington during the period of the "left turn" was prevalent. At the same time, interim administrations' denial of the principles of anti-Americanism did not lead to the long-term results and radical progress in relations. Nevertheless, there is no reason to point out a formation of a trend towards the dependence of the Latin American countries on the changes in U.S. policy. On the contrary, the line to the independence and sovereignty, which was developed in the previous decade, is being maintained. Results. The dynamics of the analyzed bilateral relations and the adjustment of the foundations of cooperation in multilateral formats indicate a strong subjective factor and an increasing influence of ideology in the foreign policy of the states in the region.

AB The study of Dostoevsky's project is in line with the search for a single Russian project of civilizational development, i.e. own model of life structure (form of government, value system, etc.), studying the cultural and civilizational characteristics of Russia and understanding the foundations of national identity. The article reconstructs the project of the development of Russia, presented in the works of Fyodor Dostoevsky, and in this context the problems of the origin of the state, the secularization of the church, relations between morality and politics, the church and the state, state and church court, Russia and the Western countries, the stages of civilizational development are considered, the concepts of vsechelovecheskoe and universal are analyzed; three levels of understanding of the universal in the writings of the writer are revealed. The study opens up the metaphysical foundations of Dostoevsky's project, on the basis of which the writer points out the existence of a universal connection between people, and asserts the need for the integration of humanity on a new basis in the General Synthesis. The article reveals the fundamental values of Russian civilization, which, according to the writer, are brotherhood, universality and vsechelovechnost, inextricably linked with Orthodoxy. The author traces the development of Dostoevsky's socio-political and religious-moral ideas in the philosophy of the beginning of the 20th century. The socio-philosophical views of Dostoevsky are considered in the context of the ecclesiastical and historiosophical concepts of Aleksey Khomyakov, Vladimir Solovyov, Nikolay Danilevsky, Konstantin Leontiev and others. The article concludes about the relevance of the questions posed by Dostoevsky and the solutions proposed by him. It is shown that Dostoevsky's ideas, being rethought and filled with new content, exist in modern public consciousness. The writer offers examples of new ways of human-human, humansocial interaction, and interaction between social communities. The ultimate goal of his project is the transformation of the individual and society.

AB Introduction. The article focuses on the reasons for the lack of political subjectivity among the Egyptians in the Byzantine period (4th - first half of the 7th centuries). During this period, the population of Egypt did not demonstrate it at any level: social movements (uprisings) did not offer such agenda; studies on literature and rhetoric show that the Egyptians were under the influence of the Roman statehood (Eastern Roman Empire). The aims of the study are therefore concentrated around the consideration of the causes and terms of the loss of political subjectivity by the Egyptians, and the reasons for the increase of it among the Romans. An additional task was a comparative analysis of the political and religious systems of Ancient Rome and Ancient Egypt and the possible influence of religious features on the configuration of political systems. Methods. The main methods used in the study are factor analysis and the comparative method. Analysis. The ancient Egyptian political system was "introverted" and static in nature. The complete loss of political subjectivity by the Egyptians can be, however, attributed to the Roman period. In the Persian and Ptolemaic ones, its existence is preserved due to two main factors: the practices of the Persians and Ptolemies to present themselves as Egyptian pharaohs and the strong positions of the Egyptian priesthood, who could keep an ancient political subjectivity. Results. The Romans, who refused to continue Ptolemaic practices and took drastic measures to limit the economic independence of the Egyptian priesthood, managed to nullify its authentic political subjectivity. Thanks to an "extroverted" and transformative political model, supported by a "political theology" based on the "Roman myth", the Roman state managed to maintain (or even strengthen) its subjectivity in the period of late Antiquity.

AB Translation of Buddhist texts from Sanskrit into Chinese was of great importance for spreading and emergence of Buddhism in China. And yet the history of these texts translation has not yet received a sufficiently complete and comprehensive coverage in the Russian literature. The relevance of studying this topic is determined by importance of studying the centuries-long process of translating Buddhist literature into Chinese for understanding the history of Buddhism in China. It was one of the most important factors in transformation and Sinification of Buddhism in the country. This article is devoted to the least known period in the history of Buddhist texts translation, i.e. the period of Nanbeichao (Southern and Northern Kingdoms, 420-589). This period is of particular importance for the history of Buddhism in China, since it was then that social, cultural, and religious fodder had developed for emergence of schools of Chinese Buddhism, which marked the definitive formation of Buddhism in China. The article is to study the translation activities of Buddhist missionaries in the Southern and Northern Kingdoms. Therefore, it sets several tasks: to analyze the process of translating Buddhist literature in both kingdoms; to determine the continuity and differences between translations of the specified period and those of the previous eras; and to assess their historical significance. The solution to these problems rests on the method of systematic and comparative analysis. The article shows that, despite the difference in political, economic, and social situations in both kingdoms, translation activities did not differ much. They followed translation traditions of the Eastern Jin period (316-420). Much attention was paid to translation of the Yogachara school literature, reflecting the development of Buddhism in India. Attention was also paid to translation of the Mahayana texts, which played a huge role in the formation of philosophical and soteriological principles of Chinese Buddhism. The research has introduced into scientific use some little-known translations of Buddhist sources and named their translators. It has been revealed that, in the period under review, the greatest importance was attached to repeated translations, which indicated the further improvement of translation technique. It has been determined that re-translations played an important role in the shaping of doctrines of the schools of Chinese Buddhism. The study concludes that the history of translation of Buddhist texts in the Nanbeichao period is a valuable source for studying not only history of Buddhism of the period, but also social and political history of medieval China. It can clarify many issues related to adaptation of the Indian Buddhism values to the Chinese cultural environment.

AB The establishment of the biopolitical paradigm of state gov-ernance, which views its main task in the implementation of ambitious socio-economic and military-political projects in close connection with the control over individuals and even care for their living, has produced a fundamentally new type of social contract that puts the authorities and the population who they patronize into mutual dependence. The balance of interests manifests it-self in the form of a welfare state that embodies the positive side of biopoliti-cal governance and provides the public with numerous benefits associated with the admission to participation in the economic and political life.
   Based on the analysis of the processes unfolding in the recent years, the authors come to the conclusion that the consensus reached during the "great biopolitical game" is not unshakable. The long journey to include the popula-tion into the economy and politics in the interests of the authorities resulted in an unintended long-term consequence for the latter - a progressive decline in the productivity of the investment into the population within the established status quo. The effectiveness of such investments is almost exhausted. The growing demands of the population, who expects greater care from the author-ities, reflect the trend towards a consumer revolution from below. However, these demands may turn out to be overwhelming for the biopower that could in the blink of an eye reverse the costly policy that stopped being beneficial, which creates a tendency towards the counter-revolution from above. Against this background, the authorities could regress to the forms of government that deny the people the living standards that they became used to.

Describing the thematic sections of the conference (on political, economic, and military history, auxiliary historical disciplines, historiography, history of Byzantium and the East, and others) and analyzing the composition of the participants, the author remarks the predominance of speakers from Moscow and St. Petersburg and suggests that the next All-Russian Congress of Medievalists should take place outside the capital. In addition, having compared the experience of this conference with similar events organized abroad, the author raises the question of the need to recreate the All-Russian Association of Medievalists and specialists in Early Modern History.

DE nation; people; culture; neo-Kantianism
AB Sergei (Sergius) Hessen (1887-1950) views the nation within a framework as a stage in the development of a collective social subject that shapes culture. This interpretation of the nation implies a corresponding justification of individual freedom and social good. Hessen's use of the axiology of Southwest German neo-Kantianism allows him to correlate individual and social goals of development. Hessen links freedom and socialization, viewing personal creativity as a contribution to the public good. Using the Kantian ethics of duty to justify freedom, Hessen associates it with adherence to duty, a rejection of natural arbitrariness. Duty implies socialization: the individual recognizes oneself as a member of society along with other individuals. The individual recognizes the supra- individual goals of development - the goals of society - and considers oneself a participant in the realization of these goals. Individuals develop identities if they recognize freedom - submit to duty and participate in the realization of supra-individual goals. Any culture, according to Hessen, is possible in the form of the national realization of cultural values. The nation is a stage in the development of social cohesion that has the capacity to shape culture. Hessen views the nation and the people as stages in the development of the social subject. Just as individuals develop identities and join others in the realization of the super-individual goals of development, so a people is transformed into a nation if they discover for themselves the super-national goals of development and join with other nations in their realization. According to Hessen, national education helps to correlate individual freedom with the public good, to achieve the conjunction of individual and societal goals of development. Through education, Hessen affirms the connection between individual freedom and universal values through the nation and justifies human development in the form of a pluralism of national cultures.

AB Ionin's monograph "The Drama of Max Weber's Life" reveals a number of aspects of Weber's life and work that are new to Russian web studies, related to both deeply personal and professional and socio-political conflicts. The review analyzes the problems of professional self-determination faced by Weber and his attitude to political activity. The fate of Weber's scientific heritage is considered in the context of contradictions in the development of modern science, including the problems of translation and the language of science in the global world. Here the author gives very valuable comments on the translation of some concepts introduced into science by Weber. It is shown that the inevitability of the transformation of some of his ideas into "pop sociology" is due to both the formation of mass society and the problems of the development of the institute of science. The problems of rationalization and "disenchantment of the world" are considered as the central idea of Weber's work, special attention is paid to L.G. lonin's interpretation of Weber's little-known statements about the relationship of eroticism and rationality, about "erotic domination", in the context of collisions of the scientist's personal life.

DE history; Egyptian campaign; Jean-Lambert Tallien; Napoleon Bonaparte;
   Jean-Baptiste Kleber
AB The Egyptian expedition became one of the most grandiose ideas of Napoleon Bonaparte: in addition to the military, dozens of civilians went to the unknown eastern country, called to explore this distant and mysterious civilization. There was Jean-Lambert Tallien among them, an eminent revolutionary politician, the hero of the state coup of 9 Thermidor, a former deputy of the National Convention and of the Council of Five Hundred. Having lost his former political influence in Paris, experiencing a personal drama, in dire need of money, he took the risk of following Bonaparte to regain authority and, if possible, improve his financial situation. Going to Egypt, he placed great hopes on this expedition and on the talents of its organizer. However, after Bonaparte, leaving his army to the mercy of fate, fled to France under a plausible pretext, Tallien entered the inner circle of General Jean-Baptiste Kleber, who took over as commander-in-chief of the Army of Orient. Tallien won Kleber's trust, but after the tragic death of the General on June 14, 1800, it was impossible for him to find a common language with the new commander-in-chief, General Menou. The author of the article, based on the analysis of wide range of sources, among which a special attention was paid to Talien's personal and official correspondence, as well as the memoirs of his contemporaries, attempted to study the motives that prompted him to join this expedition, his activities in Egypt as a civil commissioner, the evolution of his relationship with Kleber and the reasons that forced Tallien to leave Egypt a few months after the assassination of the commander-in-chief.

AB The search and analysis of ways to overcome the "difficult" repressive past inherited from the 20th century by many countries including Russia, is one of the tasks of contemporary humanitarian thought. However, in the reflections of many researchers, very little attention is paid to the topic of "descendants of executioners". In Russia, the topic of "descendants of executioners" is also quite marginal.
   Nevertheless, a number of significant events took place in the public media space in the 2/2 of the 2010s - early 2020s. It started a more active discussion of this topic. Thus, general public learned about the project "Investigation of KARAGODIN", about the database "Personnel of the USSR State Security Bodies. 1935-1939", about a letter of repentance from the granddaughter of an NKVD officer involved in the case of great-grandfather D. Karagodin, at 2016, and about a lawsuit by a descendant of another NKVD officer demanding that the author of the project be brought to legal responsibility, at 2021. In addition, the lawsuit on the liquidation of "Memorial" caused a great resonance in the society at 2021. These events intensified discussions about the "descendants of the executioners" and their responsibility for the deeds of their ancestors. Here were manifested the positions of not only the "descendants of the victims", but also the "descendants of the executioners" and representatives of the "double heritage" (simultaneous descendants of both), trying to find ways to comprehend the inherited "legacy". The article is devoted to the analysis of the meanings and dynamics of these discussions.

   Provisional Government; Terek region
AB Introduction. The article deals with the change of power in Kabarda in the context of the region's involvement in the all-Russian revolutionary process. An unbiased analysis of the event canvas, reinforced by a new texture, made it possible to reconstruct two key plots of political transformations in Kabarda: the transition from the previous "tsarist" administration to the new "February" one in March - April 1917, and the proclamation of Soviet power in March 1918. Materials and methods. Sources of "revolutionary" origin published in censored form in Soviet times, including both official documents and a memoir narrative, do not reflect an integral objective picture of the transfer of power in Kabarda. The one-sided, ideologically mediated interpretation of the events was overcome by the verification of the existing corpus of published sources, the appeal to the original texts and the comparison of the latter with the archival materials that have become available from the "counter-revolutionary camp". Analysis. The fall of the monarchy and the formation of the Provisional Government structures (regional and district civil executive committees) was supported and accepted by the overwhelming majority of the population of Kabarda and Terek region as a whole, which predetermined the conflict-free nature of the change of power. At the same time, the overthrow of the Provisional Government by the Bolsheviks in October 1917 divided the region into opposing camps - supporters and opponents of the country's new political course. The current confrontational situation affected the nature of the transition to power of the Soviets in Kabarda. Results. The national "bourgeois" elite took leading positions in the administrative structures of the "February" administration in Kabarda not as a result of the seizure of power, as it was claimed in Soviet studies, but in the course of democratic election procedures. The real picture of the proclamation of Soviet power was also significantly different from the well-established interpretations, according to which, as a result of an operation brilliantly planned by the Bolsheviks, the "counter-revolutionary" leadership of Kabarda was overthrown and the military formations under its control were disarmed. In reality, everything turned out to be less pretentious: realizing the futility of further retention of power in the conditions of the transfer of Terek region under the control of the Bolsheviks and the collapse of the structures of the "February" administration in the region, the local bourgeois elite decided to transfer their powers to the Soviets, which was consolidated through the corresponding formal procedures at the people's forum held in March 1918.

AB The question of the transformation of the colonial strategies of France and Spain in relation to Morocco with the beginning of the war in the Rif Republic is considered. A comparative analysis of the colonial policy of the two European metropolises before the start of the revolt of the Rif tribes and during the Rif War is carried out. It is argued that this war, in its duration, scale and international resonance. called into question the entire colonial system and created a dangerous precedent. Disagreements within the power elites of the metropolises between supporters of flexible diplomatic methods of colonization and advocates of a direct military solution are analyzed. The novelty of this study is seen in the fact that the victory of the military lobby in France and Spain meant the radicalization of the methods of "conciliation" applied to the local population. The use of modem weapons and aircraft, which meant the mass extermination of the local population, anticipated the methods of the Second World War. The author comes to the conclusion that the war in the Rif had the most profound impact on the political development of Spain, largely predetermining the establishment of a military-nationalist dictatorship ten years later.

Golovnin (1821-1886) is not included in the historiographical canon of Russian thoughtThe paper shows that Golovnin's intellectual heritage is still beyond the interests of historians of Russian thought. Golovnin's activity as Minister of Public Education of the government of Alexander II is considered in the national social and humanitarian science "in the department" of history, political science, history of pedagogy in the context of the Great Reforms studies, but is not included in the subject area of the history of philosophy. In my opinion, the increment of knowledge in Russian thought history will be associated with the inclusion of A.V. Golovnin in the narrative not only as the author of the education reform who changed the position of philosophy in Russia and who gave a powerful impetus to the intellectual process, but also as an independent Christian liberal thinker and a participant in ideological discussions in the mid-1850s-1870s determining their direction and content.

ID ANTHROPOLOGY
AB This article discusses the "Far-Eastern Hectare" program as a ritualized bureaucratic development policy. It addresses why such a project is presented as exemplary and successful. The authors use the analytical approach of ritualized action by Humphrey and Laidlaw, in which the search for the meaning of ritual action is abandoned in favor of focusing on the ritualization process as a mechanism of legitimizing power. Theoretically, the authors extend Fergusons argument about the development projects as anti-political machines, arguing that projects do not necessarily lead to the depoliticization of unjust resource allocation and issues of poverty. They show that, although formal indicators indicate the program's success, it is far more correct to characterize it as a failure. Despite all the efforts, mass resettlement to the East and meaningful investment in the land have not been achieved. The demographic agenda has gradually receded, giving way to the idea of "living and working on your own land". It is shown that the real practices of land development differ from those actively discussed and promoted by the operators. Analyzing the image of the Far East and Far-Easterners and the gap between the image of the program and real the practices of the land's (under) development, the authors conclude that the program is turning into a bureaucratic ritual that legitimizes the presence of the central power in the periphery. The empirical data were obtained during field research conducted by the authors from 2016 in the southern regions of the Far East (interview, ethnography). The authors also draw on primary data from applications, open sources, and official documents.

AB In the review article, based on the methods of evolutionary and institutional theory, system paradigm, analytical assessment and historical approach, a comprehensive review of scientific materials concerning the evolution of trade, economic and military-political Euro-Asian relations and organizational and institutional directions of the revival of the spirit of the Great Silk Road (GSR) as an instrument of innovation and integration interaction in the space of global Eurasia, including without the participation of China, is given. The study is a continuation of the authors' work on the analysis of the consequences of the PRC's Belt and Road Initiative as a "soft power" for the spread of Chinese global influence. The review, classification and analysis of scientific materials concerning various forms of geopolitical confrontation between states and regions for control over trade routes, which can be carried out both through the formation of a huge empire and the creation of interstate-corporate partnership in order to ensure the economic security of long-distance trade from the Mediterranean and Northern Europe to East Asia, are presented. It is shown that the establishment of Euro-Asian relations took place in various nodal points and territories of the world economy: Central Asia, the Italian trade republics, the Nordic countries, as well as through the creation of global trade empires and quasi-state corporate structures by European states. The systematization of risks and negative consequences of the functioning of modern trade routes, the revival of the spirit of the GSR on the political and economic situation of Russia is given. Special attention is paid to scientific research, which warns against overly active involvement of the country in world trade. The vectors of Russia's participation as a leader in the innovative and industrial development of trade routes of the XXI century, primarily in the North-South direction, are determined.

AB Introduction. The article examines the reaction of American diplomatic, political and media circles, who were involved in the development of the US political course and the formation of mass sentiments, to the crisis in Czechoslovakia in February 1948. It reveals connections between the perceptions of political processes in Eastern Europe by various segments of the American political elite and the nature of political decisions made by the US government. Methods. The research is based on archival documents and articles of leading American papers. Their analysis allows us to consider the transformation of the image of Czechoslovakia, perceptions of its domestic and foreign policy, the evolution of assessments of Czechoslovak realities in the US, depending on the domestic and international situation and changing world situation. Analysis. In February 1948, during the tense political crisis, a communist regime was established in Czechoslovakia. This event completed the creation of the Soviet bloc in Europe, and influenced the development of the US containment policy towards the USSR and the escalation of the Cold War. The February crisis caused a tangible reaction in the United States. It was considered in American media, diplomatic and political circles in general context of growing international tension and Soviet-American controversies. Results. The author concludes that the US government was convinced that the communists' coup d' &tat was inspired by the Kremlin The Americans were shocked by its suddenness and speed, the lack of resistance from democratic forces. This effect was used by the US government to whip up anti-Soviet sentiments and to adopt the Marshall Plan.

AB The analysis of the members of the CPSU Politburo of the Central Committee biographical characteristics as an elite category in the structure of the Soviet political class is carried out. The purpose of the study is to identify normative patterns in the career trajectories of the highest stratum of the Soviet political elite. To achieve this goal, a database was formed containing the biographical characteristics of the leaders who had the status of a member and candidate member of the Politburo in the period from 1966 to 1990. Some parameters of the biographies of the studied leaders are of a normative nature, that is, they are characteristic of the majority: gender belonging to the male sex, place of birth in a rural area, higher education with a specific technical specialty, early age of starting managerial activity and relatively late age of entering the Politburo level as the highest stratum of the Soviet political class, experience in the real sector of the economy and management, combined with experience in exercising deputy powers in representative bodies at various levels. The combination of these characteristics contributed to the positive perception of the political elite by society and can be considered as a model for comparison with the political elite of modern Russia.
