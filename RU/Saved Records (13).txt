ID VOTING-BEHAVIOR; MEDIA BIAS; CULTURE; ANXIETY; ORIGINS; IMPACT
AB How do the media affect public support for democratic institutions in a fragile democracy? What role do they play in a dictatorial regime? We study these questions in the context of Germany of the 1920s and 1930s. During the democratic period, when the Weimar government introduced progovernment political news, the growth of Nazi popularity slowed down in areas with access to radio. This effect was reversed during the campaign for the last competitive election as a result of the pro-Nazi radio broadcast following Hitler's appointment as chancellor. During the consolidation of dictatorship, radio propaganda helped the Nazis enroll new party members. After the Nazis established their rule, radio propaganda incited anti-Semitic acts and denunciations of Jews to authorities by ordinary citizens. The effect of anti-Semitic propaganda varied depending on the listeners' predispositions toward the message. Nazi radio was most effective in places where anti-Semitism was historically high and had a negative effect in places with historically low anti-Semitism.

AB Do the political values of the general public form a coherent system? What might be the source of coherence? We view political values as expressions, in the political domain, of more basic personal values. Basic personal values (e.g., security, achievement, benevolence, hedonism) are organized on a circular continuum that reflects their conflicting and compatible motivations. We theorize that this circular motivational structure also gives coherence to political values. We assess this theorizing with data from 15 countries, using eight core political values (e.g., free enterprise, law and order) and ten basic personal values. We specify the underlying basic values expected to promote or oppose each political value. We offer different hypotheses for the 12 non-communist and three post-communist countries studied, where the political context suggests different meanings of a basic or political value. Correlation and regression analyses support almost all hypotheses. Moreover, basic values account for substantially more variance in political values than age, gender, education, and income. Multidimensional scaling analyses demonstrate graphically how the circular motivational continuum of basic personal values structures relations among core political values. This study strengthens the assumption that individual differences in basic personal values play a critical role in political thought.

   Imperial and Double Colonial Difference
SO INTERSECTIONS-EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY AND POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
DE post-Soviet; coloniality of knowledge; imperial and colonial difference;
   disciplinary implosion; epistemic racism
AB The article considers the main challenges faced by the post-Soviet social sciences in the global configuration of knowledge, marked by omnipresent coloniality. In disciplinary terms this syndrome is manifested in the social sciences versus area studies divide from which the post-Soviet is either excluded or equalized with post-colonial discourses. The situation can be described as a general invisibility of the post-Soviet space and its social sciences and scientists for the rest of the world and the refusal of the global North to accept the post-Soviet scholar in the capacity of a rational subject. The reasons for this complex intersection of the post-Soviet, post-colonial and other post-dependence factors are both internal and external, political and epistemic. Following the methodological principles of decolonial option the author analyses such specific elements of the post-Soviet stagnant configuration in knowledge production as the external imperial difference and the double colonial difference, the geo-politics and body-politics of knowledge the way they are reflected in the knowledge production and distribution, paying specific attention to possible ways out of this epistemic dead-end.

AB In the wake of the Ukrainian crisis in 2013-2014, renewed attention has been given to the earlier so-called frozen conflicts of the successor states of the Soviet Union. In Georgia, Moldova, and Azerbaijan, national conflicts of the early 1990s resulted in establishment of four breakaway regions, the de facto states of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria, and Nagorny Karabakh. While the first three are supported by Russia, the latter is supported by Armenia. Such support as well as growing internal legitimacy has enabled these republics to retain separate status for almost 25years. Though appearing quite similar from an external perspective, the populations of the de facto states are quite diverse in composition, geopolitical preferences, and support for political institutions and persons. Large representative public opinion surveys conducted by the authors in 2010-2011 in the four de facto states allow a deeper comprehension of internal political and social dynamics. Three main dimensions of their current status and orientation (relations with Russia, support for local institutions, and possibilities of post-war reconciliation) are examined using nine key comparative questions. Nationality is the main predictor of divergent opinions within the republics, and results are reported along this dimension. Close relations with the external patron, support for the legitimacy and identity of the respective de facto republics, and little interest in returning to the parent state testify to the longevity and successful promotion of state and nation in the de facto republics in the Caucasus-Black Sea Region.

AB How does the degree of centralization and decentralization of political control affect economic performance? To investigate this question, we gather and analyze a comprehensive original data-set measuring the performance, career paths, and incentives of regional officials in China and Russia during the last 15years. Both China and Russia combine centralized personnel selection with substantial administrative autonomy for regional officials, but differ substantially with respect to the economic outcomes produced by their bureaucratic systems. We find that in contrast to China, regional leaders in Russia are unlikely to be promoted for economic or social performance, have a lower turnover, are almost never transferred from one region to another, have less experience in executive positions, are more likely to come from the region they govern than their Chinese counterparts, and are not encouraged to show initiative in economic affairs and engage in economic policy experimentation.

AB The differentiation in the impact of resources on economic growth is often explained by the specifics of institutional factors. The aim of this paper is to investigate how sub-national political differences influence the effect of natural resources on economic growth. Using a dataset of Russian regions, this paper demonstrates that sub-national democratization influences the growth effects of resources and considers possible mechanisms for this influence. The paper finds that in Russia, natural resources are only capable of promoting growth in the regions with non-democratic political systems that, at the same time, have an efficient and non-corrupt bureaucracy.

AB A political scientist examines how regional elites shape the electoral fortunes of Russia's hegemonic party, United Russia (UR). Using original data on regional legislative elections from 2003 to 2011, we show that UR performs better in those regions where regional governors control strong political machines. Russia's leadership undercut its own electoral strategy by replacing popular elected governors with colorless bureaucrats who struggled to mobilize votes on behalf of United Russia. This is one of the reasons for United Russia's poor performance in recent elections.

AB This article aims to explore the microfoundations of political support under a nondemocratic regime by investigating the impact of a natural disaster on attitudes toward the government. The research exploits the enormous wildfires that occurred in rural Russia during the summer of 2010 as a natural experiment. The authors test the effects of fires with a survey of almost eight hundred respondents in seventy randomly selected villages. The study finds that in the burned villages there is higher support for the government at all levels. Most counterintuitively, the rise of support for authorities cannot be fully explained by the generous governmental aid. The authors interpret the results by the demonstration effect of the government's performance.

TI 'The Spiritual and Moral Foundation of Civilization in Every Nation for
   Thousands of Years': The Traditional Values Discourse in Russia
SO POLITICS RELIGION & IDEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of traditional values' occupies the place of honor in public discourse in Russia today being one of the components of the new ideological narrative. The article is focused on the strategy of the promotion of traditional values by its secular and religious protagonists. It includes three thematic sections: (1) the analysis of the interpretation of the historical past and its place in the concept of traditional values; (2) the investigation of the role of the West' as enemy' in constructing national identity and defending traditional values; and (3) the examination of the opposition of universality and particularism with regard to traditional values. The author concludes that the concept of traditional values as a response to social and political challenges is promoted by secular powers and religious authorities for the ideological consolidation of Russian society, as well as for the recruiting potential allies on the international arena. At the same time, the noticeable presence of traditional values in public discourse indicates the thirst for reliable meanings in the process of the search for national identity.

AB The arrest of the protest punk band Pussy Riot (PR) in March 2012 and the subsequent prosecution of three band members pose a significant puzzle for political science. Although PR's performances presented a coherent alternative to the Putin regime's image of Russian reality, it was unlikely that the discordant music and crude lyrics of their art protest would inspire Russian society to take to the streets. Yet, the regime mounted a very visible prosecution against the three young women. We argue that the trial marked a shift in the Kremlin's strategy to shape state-society relations. In the face of declining economic conditions and social unrest, the PR trial encapsulated the Kremlin's renewed focus on three related mechanisms to insure social support: coercion, alliance building, and symbolic politics. The PR trial afforded the Kremlin an important opportunity to simultaneously redefine its loyal constituency, secure the Church-state relationship, and stigmatize the opposition.

AB This paper seeks to explain the surprising decline in Russian President Vladimir Putin's approval rating in 2011. During the previous 10 years, Putin's rating had correlated closely with Russians' perceptions of the state of the economy. Yet the fall in his approval - from 79% in December 2010 to 63% a year later - occurred despite roughly stable economic perceptions. Comparing Levada Center polls from late 2010 and 2011, the paper explores both who (what types of respondents) grew disenchanted with Putin, and why (what issues or grievances prompted this switch). It finds that (a) the fall in support for the Kremlin - although faster among members of the "creative class," women, the rich, and residents of provincial cities - was broad-based, occurring among all social groups examined; (b) attitudes toward immigration, the West, and Russia's international status, as well as assessments of public service quality, changed little during 2011; (c) Putin's declining popularity most likely reflected stronger - not weaker - economic concerns; although the proportion judging economic performance to be poor did not increase, those who saw economic weakness became much less supportive of the Kremlin. Russians appear to have increasingly blamed their political leaders for unsatisfactory economic and political outcomes.

AB Focusing on Muslim populations in five Muslim-majority countries and four Western European countries, we examine the correlates of popular support for terrorist violence. In both samples, support for terrorism is stronger among those who see democracy as a Western political system which is not suitable for Muslim societies. Perceived Western economic dominance is related to more support for terrorism among Muslims in Western Europe. In the Muslim countries, blaming the West for negative international relations is associated with greater support for terrorism. The associations found are remarkably similar across the Western European countries but vary considerably across the Muslim countries, preventing generalized interpretations. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that perceptions about world politics represent an important factor of pro-terrorist views among Muslims. Therefore, we suggest that improvement of the relationships between the West and the Muslim world can reduce support for terrorism.

AB Emergent properties of global political culture were examined using data from the World History Survey (WHS) involving 6,902 university students in 37 countries evaluating 40 figures from world history. Multidimensional scaling and factor analysis techniques found only limited forms of universality in evaluations across Western, Catholic/Orthodox, Muslim, and Asian country clusters. The highest consensus across cultures involved scientific innovators, with Einstein having the most positive evaluation overall. Peaceful humanitarians like Mother Theresa and Gandhi followed. There was much less cross-cultural consistency in the evaluation of negative figures, led by Hitler, Osama bin Laden, and Saddam Hussein. After more traditional empirical methods (e.g., factor analysis) failed to identify meaningful cross-cultural patterns, Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was used to identify four global representational profiles: Secular and Religious Idealists were overwhelmingly prevalent in Christian countries, and Political Realists were common in Muslim and Asian countries. We discuss possible consequences and interpretations of these different representational profiles.

AB This paper examines the effects of reforms and religion on happiness in transition economies. Earlier literature suggests that religiosity insures happiness against various individual stressful life events. This phenomenon is well-explored in developed countries but rarely studied in post-communist countries, where religion was officially suppressed for a long period. These countries have undergone considerable economic transformations over the past two decades. Using cross-sectional Life in Transition Survey data and historical data on religions, I examine if religion insures against economic reforms. The endogeneity of religion is taken into account. The findings suggest that economic reforms may have both positive and negative effects on happiness. Religiosity indeed insures happiness and perceptions of economic and political situations against economic reforms. Journal of Comparative Economics 42 (3) (2014) 804-818.

AB The celebrated Aumann theorem states that if two agents have common priors, and their posteriors for a given event E are common knowledge, then their posteriors must be equal; agents with the same priors cannot agree to disagree. The aim of this note is to show that in some contexts agents using a quantum probability scheme for decision making can agree to disagree even if they have the common priors, and their posteriors for a given event E are common knowledge. We also point to sufficient conditions guaranteeing impossibility to agree on disagree even for agents using quantum(-like) rules in the process of decision making. A quantum(-like) analog of the knowledge operator is introduced; its basic properties can be formulated similarly to the properties of the classical knowledge operator defined in the set-theoretical approach to representation of the states of the world and events (Boolean logics). However, this analogy is just formal, since quantum and classical knowledge operators are endowed with very different assignments of truth values. A quantum(-like) model of common knowledge naturally generalizing the classical set-theoretic model is presented. We illustrate our approach by a few examples; in particular, on attempting to escape the agreement on disagree for two agents performing two different political opinion polls. We restrict our modeling to the case of information representation of an agent given by a single quantum question-observable (of the projection type). A scheme of extending of our model of knowledge/common knowledge to the case of information representation of an agent based on a few question-observables is also presented and possible pitfalls are discussed.

TI Center-Periphery Dissonance as a Possible Factor of the Revolutionary

AB Jack Goldstone proposes three predictors for acute social and political destabilization during the revolutionary wave of 2013-2014: (a) an intermediate level of per capita GDP, (b) a high level of corruption, and (c) a transitional type of political regime. After testing this theory on a broader sample, this study suggests and finds support for another predictorcenter-periphery dissonance for the destabilization of the 2013-2014 wave. The emergence of this factor is common in the process of modernization, and is due to the heterogeneity of modernization processes, when a system's central elements (capitals) are almost always modernized faster than its periphery. Identification of this factor is of considerable interest because accounting for this factor could significantly improve our capability to predict risks of sociopolitical destabilization of modernizing social systems.

   resilience
ID RISK; VULNERABILITY; ROBUSTNESS; RESILIENCE; SYSTEMS
AB The contemporary global community is increasingly interdependent and confronted with systemic risks posed by the actions and interactions of actors existing beneath the level of formal institutions, often operating outside effective governance structures. Frequently, these actors are human agents, such as rogue traders or aggressive financial innovators, terrorists, groups of dissidents, or unauthorized sources of sensitive or secret information about government or private sector activities. In other instances, influential "actors" take the form of climate change, communications technologies, or socioeconomic globalization. Although these individual forces may be small relative to state governments or international institutions, or may operate on long time scales, the changes they catalyze can pose significant challenges to the analysis and practice of international relations through the operation of complex feedbacks and interactions of individual agents and interconnected systems. We call these challenges "femtorisks," and emphasize their importance for two reasons. First, in isolation, they may be inconsequential and semiautonomous; but when embedded in complex adaptive systems, characterized by individual agents able to change, learn from experience, and pursue their own agendas, the strategic interaction between actors can propel systems down paths of increasing, even global, instability. Second, because their influence stems from complex interactions at interfaces of multiple systems (e. g., social, financial, political, technological, ecological, etc.), femtorisks challenge standard approaches to risk assessment, as higher-order consequences cascade across the boundaries of socially constructed complex systems. We argue that new approaches to assessing and managing systemic risk in international relations are required, inspired by principles of evolutionary theory and development of resilient ecological systems.

AB The aim of the paper is to explicitly disentangle the role of political and cultural boundaries as factors of fragmentation of economies within large countries. On the one hand, local protectionism plays a substantial role in many federations and decentralized states. On the other hand, if the country exhibits high level of cultural heterogeneity, it may also contribute to the economic fragmentation; however, this topic has received significantly less attention in the literature. This paper looks at the case of China and proxies the cultural heterogeneity by the heterogeneity of local dialects. It shows that the effect of politics clearly dominates that of culture: while provincial borders seem to have a strong influence disrupting economic ties, economic linkages across provinces, even if the regions fall into the same linguistic zone, are rather weak and, on the contrary, linguistic differences within provinces do not prevent economic integration. For some language zones we do, however, find a stronger effect on economic integration. (C) 2013 Association for Comparative Economic Studies Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This article uses statistical analysis of aggregate electoral returns in order to establish continuities in the territorial patterns of support between four major political parties of contemporary Russia, on the one hand, and those parties that contested national legislative (Duma) elections from 1993 through 2007, on the other hand. It is hypothesized that such continuities, dubbed "territorial genealogies," are largely rooted in the migration of region-based gubernatorial political machines from one national party to another, which constitutes a major flow of organizational continuity in the development of political parties. Statistical analysis confirms that the main hubs of machine politics in Russia's regions, originating from the intra-elite struggles of the 1990s, provide United Russia with the territorial core of its current support. Other political parties retain electoral salience in those regions where their electoral appeal is not mitigated by the presence of political machines, which underscores the importance of non-machine party organization for their electoral destinies.

AB How do homo- and bisexual people explain the launch of a homophobia campaign that violates their basic human rights? Which narratives do they use to adjust to the hostile environment? On the basis of 77 in-depth problem-centered interviews with LGBT in Russia we explore the explanations they use to talk about their experience of a homophobia campaign. Respondents demonstrate their awareness of the political reasoning behind the campaign and explain it as a tool for electoral mobilization, the repression of pro-Western oriented opposition and as a part of biopolitical technologies adopted by the government to increase its control over people's bodies and minds. Contrary to intuitive expectations, this political awareness does not protect the informants from self-blame, social escapism and moral suffering.

AB This paper examines how civic organisations dealing with social rights have responded to Russian welfare reforms. As beneficiaries of the Soviet paternalistic system of social provision, their interest has been to resist neoliberal policy shifts. However, the crackdown on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) under President Putin de-incentivises making challenging political claims. By distinguishing between 'rent-seeking' and 'profit-seeking' activities of NGOs (resulting in either the redistribution or production of public wealth), this paper enhances understanding of state-society relations in Russia. It highlights contradictory practices that allow the state to reduce overt, politicised protest by providing channels for certain privileged social groups and organisations.

The analysis examines three modes of co-optation: direct co-optation into the dominant party, United Russia; indirect co-optation via well-established political parties with limited electoral appeal; and mediated co-optation via new quasi-opposition parties sponsored by the authorities. Several properties of parties, including electoral potential, ideological rigidity, and organisational stability, are identified as factors that determine the modes of co-optation for different categories of politicians.

AB This article compares competitive authoritarian, one-party authoritarian, and democratic party systems on three parameters: likelihood to emerge, sustainability and durability. By applying a variety of statistical techniques to a comprehensive dataset on post-World War II elections, this study shows that under competitive authoritarianism, elections are less likely to be party-structured than in democracies, and that competitive authoritarian party systems are markedly less sustainable and durable than systems in the other categories, especially in democracies. These findings are in accordance with the theory according to which competitive authoritarian institutions are epiphenomena, reflecting the distribution of power in the polity but not shaping it. Their emergence and survival are consequences rather than causes of the stability and success of contemporary autocracies.

AB Strong international partnerships are a key vehicle for building an efficient national innovation system. Successful global cooperation needs comprehensive knowledge of the features of the science and technology (S&T) sphere in a changing environment of global division of labour, competition, and political climates. New realities and trends emerge, changing the established 'rules of the game' and calling for immediate actions from politicians, experts, and various economic actors.
   The authors propose an analytical approach to build and examine an empirical database. Drawing on bibliometric analysis and expert survey tools, such an approach helps allows identifying the most promising areas for Russia's international S&T cooperation. The authors assess the scope for applying the proposed methodology. Based on the latest available data in Web of Science, the international scientific citation indexing service (2014 and early 2015), they compare the structure and variation over time of scientific specializations in Russia, leading S&T countries, and several rapidly growing global economies.
   The cooperation priorities that were identified via matrix analysis were complemented with data from expert surveys. The surveys highlighted the partner organizations, thematic areas, and instruments of S&T cooperation, which indicate some of the future possibilities for Russia's international S&T cooperation.

AB This article discusses the Russian-Norwegian fishery cooperation in the Barents Sea. The focus is on the common management of the shared cod resource, the Northeast Arctic cod stock. The article emphasizes the historical development of the cooperation in periods of changing political environment and different challenges for the common management agreement. The political changes define two distinct periods of bilateral cooperation and joint management. The first period is from 1975, when the Soviet Union and Norway established the Joint Soviet-Norwegian Fisheries Commission, to the end of the Soviet Union in 1991. The second period is from 1992 when the Russian Federation took over the obligations of fisheries cooperation with Norway from the Soviet Union. Although significant political, institutional and economic changes took place during these periods the biological facts remained, as the growth patterns and distribution of the exploited ecosystem did not change. The Russian exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is the main feeding area for juveniles and small cod, while the Norwegian EEZ includes spawning areas and the main feeding grounds for the mature and larger cod. The trust and cooperative spirit that developed through the Joint Fisheries Commission, both among researchers and managers of the two countries, has been crucial for the development of successful annual agreements and their outcomes. The Russian-Norwegian management of the Northeast Arctic cod stock has succeeded in protecting and maintaining the cod stock in the interest of both countries.

AB The anti-regime actions that began in 2011 and in the same year began to be everywhere named the Arab spring, seized practically all Arab countries, except Somalia, Djibouti and Comoros - all situated at the periphery of the Arab Orient. The said events of 2011 exerted considerable influence on the very specter of further political development and somewhere even cardinally changed the existing political regimes. This work presents "reconnaissance by data analysis" and is an endeavor of quantitative estimation of socio-political commotions, with the aim to elaborate the methods of counting up the instability index, that would allow to evaluate potential of "conflictogeneousness" in Arab countries.

ID SOCIETY; SECTOR
AB In this article, we present a novel way of researching civil society in a comparative perspective and illustrate it through a detailed analysis of public disputes concerning urban building construction projects in St. Petersburg and Helsinki in 2008-2009. In our illustration, we use justification theory, a line of thought developed by Luc Boltanski and Laurent Thevenot in the early 1990s, but until now little used in comparative civil society research. Moreover, we use a variant of Public Justification Analysis, a new method for analysing media data. Our focus is on moral justifications, that is, on arguments which are presented against or in favour of the proposed projects and which draw on shared moral principles. Clear differences were found in referrals to these principles by urban activists in Russia and Finland. We argue that justification theory enables both international comparisons as well as inclusion of specific features of national political cultures.

AB The research is focused on the image of the Soviet Union and that of its successor the Russian Federation in the minds of the Russian student youth. The concept of collective memory, being interdisciplinary and highly debatable, has been used in the given paper in its broad socio-cultural sense meaning the attitudes of interconnected social groups regarding the past and the present.
   The participants of the poll were 100 students from the leading Moscow universities. They had been born after the Soviet Union collapse, so, the majority of them have a very obscure idea of the Soviet reality, simultaneously feeling nostalgia for the Soviet political past. The results of the research show that the image of the Soviet Union drastically differs from that of Russia in the young people's minds being positive and negative, respectively.

TI When does local political competition lead to more public goods?:
   Evidence from Russian regions
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Political competition; Russia; Public spending; Local elites
ID REGIMES
AB In imperfect democracies, does political competition always improve the provision of public goods? To address this, we study the pattern of public expenditures on health and education in 74 Russian regions between 2004 and 2009. Because governors are now appointed by the federal government, reappointment depends on their maintaining support in the legislative elections for the ruling party. Results show that outsider governors appointed by the federal government spend more on public goods (in this case, education) than governors who had originally been elected, and then were reappointed by the federal government, when there is competition in the legislature (as measured by party share). But in cases where the ruling party is strong (virtual monopoly) or when party share is low enough that governors can do little to raise party support, governors with local ties spend more on public goods. This non-monotonic (inverted U-relationship) between expenditures on public goods and party share suggests that formal mechanisms of accountability (administrative subordination to the central government) work worse under political monopoly, while informal mechanisms (such as local ties and strong networks) work worse under political competition to encourage public goods spending.

This article offers a critical reconsideration of its substantive impact on scholarship in political science and considers why that output has not been so impressive in terms of increasing knowledge about politics, both in Russia and beyond. It presents an overview of the state of Russian political science, with an emphasis on its major theoretical, methodological, and empirical shortcomings. It also considers the role of historical, institutional, and political factors for its developmental trajectory, and offers some suggestions for overcoming them.

AB This article analyzes state-owned companies and their place in the structure of market interactions in the context of modern approaches to the study of government failures and market failures, as well as the conditions of the system of private property rights rooting. Besides the general theoretical consideration of the costs of functioning of state-owned companies, the authors refer to the specific experience of the Russian economy, consistently analyzing the opportunities and palliatives of the current privatization policy, the experience of establishment and the risks of functioning of state corporations. Particular attention is paid to the problem of limited motivation to improve the institutional environment in general and, on the contrary, the expansion of the practice of direct government intervention in order to solve the problems of economic development. The authors also consider specific areas where there is a restriction of private property rights in connection with the expansion of the public sector, de jure and de facto.

AB In recent years, both an increase in and a process of differentiation of 'new', digital media devices, including rising numbers of citizens turning to them, have stimulated recurring speculation about a readjustment of the communicative relationship between political representatives and the people. The debate about 'electronic democracy' has so far focused predominantly on technical potentials on the one hand and citizens' exposure to interactive political communication channels on the other. By contrast, the 'supply side', that is, the internet activities of political actors and especially their motives, has been investigated relatively rarely. Against this backdrop, two representative surveys were conducted among German and Austrian members of parliament that investigated their attitudes towards the internet. The results demonstrate similarities and differences in internet-related competences and assessments which are explained by micro-and meso-level factors. Foremost, an age-related 'digital divide' was found crossing the parliamentarian rows in both countries.

AB While it is commonly understood that land is a political tool, there is surprisingly little empirical research on how insecure property rights affect political outcomes. In this paper, we show how a dominant political party can use insecure property rights to ensure politically compliant voter behavior and how this power is frustrated after the introduction of a land certification program. We test this hypothesis on data covering 10,000 Mexican municipal elections during the country's democratic,transition. Exploiting the gradual rollout of a large-scale land certification program, we find that land titles significantly raised the number of votes for the main opposition parties. Importantly, this effect disappears once the dominant party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), has already lost at least one election in the municipality. These results provide an additional explanation of the PRI's downfall and, more generally, illuminate the relationship between political power, institutions and resource allocation.

   electoral manipulation
AB Political parties or candidates that participate in elections with the primary aim of splitting the vote for other parties or candidates are conventionally referred to as "spoilers". In electoral authoritarian regimes, this strategy can be used for maintaining political monopoly. This study identifies institutional and political preconditions for instrumental manipulation of political parties under electoral authoritarianism and empirically examines the efficacy of this strategy during regional legislative elections in Russia from 2012 to 2014. The analysis demonstrates that the use of spoiler parties in Russia brings only modest results due to the lack of strong ideological identifications in the electorate.

DT Article
DE STS; mega-project; global project; social engineering; risk society;
   zero-friction society; utopia; Russian cosmism; Karakum Canal
AB The article demonstrates how the science and technology studies include nowadays the analysis of political, economic, cultural and ideological contexts and extend the idea of science as the backbone of large-scale social projects. The latter, often referred to as the mega-projects are characterized by a paradoxical nature. Despite permanent cost overruns and the fatal benefit shortfalls, mega-projects continue to be financed by the public and private investors. The article offers a resolution of this paradox by distinguishing between mega-projects (which more accurate calculation can improve efficiency) and global projects that contain an inherent element of utopia and relating not only to the economy but also to the broader sphere of sociality, culture and worldview. In this case, the criticism of utopian global projects from the perspective of K. Popper's social engineering and adaptive management is questionable, and any global historical event appears as hiding the human projectivity and unanticipated spontaneity. As an example of the global project, the history of the Karakum Canal is analyzed going back to the era of Peter the Great and various connections to Russian philosophical and literary tradition.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Housing policy; Moscow; Grassroots; Mobilizations; Public space; Vilnius
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore urban mobilisation patterns in two post-Soviet cities: Vilnius and Moscow. Both cities were subject to similar housing and urban policy during Soviet times, and they have implemented urban development using neoliberal market principles, provoking grassroots opposition from citizens to privatisation and marketisation of their housing environment and local public space. However, the differing conditions of democratic Lithuanian and authoritarian Russian public governance offer different opportunities and set different constraints for neighbourhood mobilisation. The purpose is to contrast local community mobilisations under the two regimes and highlight the differences between and similarities in the activists' repertoires of actions in two distinct political and economic urban settings.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs qualitative methodology using data from semi-structured interviews conducted with community activists and state officials, presented using a comparative case study design.
   Findings - Although, citizens' mobilisations in the two cities are reactions to the neoliberalisation of housing and local public space, they take different forms. In Vilnius they are institutionalised and receive formal support from national and local authorities. Moreover, support from the EU encourages organisational development and provides material and cognitive resources for grassroots urban mobilisations. In contrast, residents' mobilisations in Moscow are informal and face fierce opposition from local authorities. However, even in an authoritarian setting, grassroots mobilisations evolve using creative strategies to circumvent institutional constraints.
   Originality/value - Little attention has been paid to grassroots urban mobilisations in post-Soviet cities. There is also a lack of comparative attempts to show variation in post-Soviet urban activism related to housing and local public space.

AB This article explores the claims of Russian officials that US assessments of economic and political developments in Russia, particularly those of Freedom House (FH), are excessively critical and often used to justify global dominance. To assess the validity of such claims, three different influences are considered: culture, power, and special interests. The article finds that all three, each with roots in the cold war, play a role in shaping assessments of Russia and help to explain why FH's analysis of Russia is more critical than the analysis of other organizations. The politics of special interests is found to be particularly influential and reflects the interests of US national security policies and priorities. Such priorities are also linked to a politics of memory derived from the cold war, which often influences perceptions of Russia as a threat rather than as a potential partner.

AB The September 2013 elections in the regions of Russia resulted in victories of the major pro-government party, United Russia, in 16 regional legislative elections, and brought success to incumbent chief executives in eight gubernatorial elections. However, the apparent recovery of United Russia from the trauma of the 2011 national legislative elections stemmed not so much from its increased popularity in the electorate, but rather from its ability to engage in manipulative vote-splitting strategies against the opposition. The rules of candidate nomination in gubernatorial elections were so restrictive that most of these elections could not be characterized as truly competitive.

AB This article presents the outcomes of a research project conducted in two small towns in the Perm region. The study of power in the two communities focused on two major themes: (1) the composition of influential actors and institutions and the power hierarchy; (2) relationships between them and coalition building. The discovered configuration of actors and relationships between them demonstrate, on the one hand, quite a lot in common with European and North American communities, on the other hand, a number of features that reflect the systemic and institutional properties of Russian politics and society. The social base of the local power structure is very narrow. The local elite composed of the heads of the executive, business leaders, and the most influential representatives of urban and district legislatures actually holds all the power in the local community, having no serious opponents or a real alternative in the foreseeable future. This power structure is supported by informal institutions and personal relationships within the elite and between the elite and those who are forced to accept the existing system of relations; it allows them to successfully protect their personal and/or corporate interests. A wide range of opportunities to use official position and/or relationships with public officials for personal enrichment stimulates the formation of various kinds of coalitions for the furtherment of the personal interests of its members.

DE power; local politics; urban communities; local elites; urban regimes
AB Who governs in a small community? The data of empirical survey conducted in two towns in Permskiy kray allow to conclude that local power structure there is very narrow (elitist). Configuration of the most influential actors in the two towns reflects the domination of the two groups with the largest sets of resources - top figures in the local executive bodies and large business. Political (administrative) elite is the leader in this pair. Mayors are the key figures in local elites, though in other circumstances we admit the leadership of the heads of the district administration which possess comparable or possibly superior resources. Large business, however, remains a visible actor in urban politics and cannot be ignored by politicians. The political opportunities and influence of other groups are very modest, although they can considerably vary and change depending on the personal leadership characteristics of their representatives. The interaction between different actors is quite diverse, dynamic and admits the possibility of various kinds of coalitions. Such coalitions have proved to be very widespread, fairly durable and effective. Although the authoritarian nature of the Russian political regime imposes limitations on particular aspects of urban politics, local actors retain a sufficient range of freedom and autonomy.

AB Despite the escalating terrorist actions, there is no polarized constellation in the Islamic politics of Dagestan. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) officers regard the corrupt Dagestan authorities to be significantly responsible for the massive conversion of youths to terrorism, and began to contact with moderate Salafis to isolate the "forest brothers" (armed Salafis) in 2010. Exploiting the FSB's soft strategy, secular intellectuals requested to reform the Muslim Spiritual Board of Dagestan by electing a legitimate mufti. Having seen the incompetence of intra-Sufi opposition (non-Avar sheikhs) in the War on Terror, the Spiritual Board jumped on the bandwagon of dialog strategy in 2012. The secular authorities of Dagestan, indifferent to intra-Muslim politics, limit their activities to the call for dialog between the secular authorities and the forest brothers. In this way, political actors hijack the master narrative of the "War on Terror" and these narratives are imported to local politics.

SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY STUDIES
LA Russian
DT Article
DE collectivity; individualism; civil self-organisation; local social
   movements; protest; depoliticization
AB The article is based on sociological research of the dynamics of new local social movements appearing after the "For fair elections" rallies. This research is based on 36 indepth interviews with activists of the newly created local groups. The respondents were recruited in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The presented analysis takes into account three activist groups (" Headquarters" and "Group of Watchers" in Moscow and "Civil Union" in Petersburg). The article is focused on the role of subjectivities in the "first time" activists in the creation of civil society institutions in Russia. The central question of the article is as follows: how do individualisation and the values of individualism influence representations of political freedom and practices of politicization. This issue is analysed within the framework of public and private spheres. The movements, which emerged from the emotional enthusiasm of protestors and election observers, are now in a crisis of demobilization. At the heart of the crisis is the contradiction between desire to sustain collective action emerging as a result of the rallies and the ethic of self-reliance and individualism that is shared by the activists. This individualism is shaped by personal careers of socialisation in a depoliticised society that has been characterised by the dominance of private sphere by the state, economic rationality and stigmatisation of the political. The authors outline their theory of depoliticisation and claim that the latter not only hinders political participation but also influences the styles and strategies of politicisation visible within the movement "For fair elections" in Russia. In the article, the authors argue that the depoliticised ethic of individualism, which previously distracted people from political participation, now forms the individualised ethic of political action, which considers participation as a voluntary contribution that can also be voluntary withdrawn.

AB The article addresses the questions, What do children in urban areas do on Saturdays? What types of organizational resources do they have access to? Does this vary by social class? Using diary data on children's activities on Saturdays in the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale metropolitan area, the authors describe the different types of venues (households, businesses, public space, associations, charities, congregations, and government/tribal agencies) that served different types of children. They find that the likelihood of using a charity or business rather than a government or tribal provider increased with family income. Also, the likelihood of using a congregation or a government facility rather than a business, charity, or household increased with being Hispanic. The authors discuss the implications for the urban division of labor on Saturdays and offer research questions that need further investigation.

AB Analyzing discourses on interethnic relations can contribute to a clearer understanding of the focal points of tensions in contemporary political communities sharing a common territory and common political institutions. These discourses represent the complex of problems related to nation-building and are generated both in the public sphere and in academic discussion. As such, they often develop separately one from the other. Assessing the current academic discourse on nations and nationalism, on nation-building and the nation-state, on citizenship, cultural diversity and interethnic conflict can contribute to the formation of the agenda of a politics of identity aimed at building a civic nation. Memory politics deserve special attention in this context, as the interpretation of historic memory has today become a powerful instrument that political elites can use to consolidate the nation and, in different contexts, to politicize ethnicity and deepen cleavages in existing nation-states. The affirmation of a positive civic (national) identity is a reference framework for modern democratic societies, and it is in meeting the challenges of politicizing ethnicity that political priorities and academic interests meet. However, the current domination of politics over academia in this conflict prone sphere contributes to its radicalization and to the formation of negative and exclusive identities that can be manipulated to pursue elitist group interests. Evaluating models of political organization alternative to the ones known today (such as "the nation-state") does not aspire to "write off" the nation, but this can help to come up with visions and ideas politics can take up to overcome the conflict potential that contemporary societies generate over ethnic issues.

TI MUSEOLOGY AS COMPLEX OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MUSEUM SCIENCE: HISTORIOGRAPHY
   OF THE PROBLEM
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE museology; museum science; historiography of museums
AB The study on Russian museology increasingly attracts attention from researchers in recent years. So far, however, the historiography of museology remains unexplored. This fact was noted by A. M Razgon and other museologists. The attention to the history of museum science allowed to learn that historian N.M. Karamzin first addressed museology problems in Russia. He worked out a special method of visualization and used it in his research of the history of Russia. Later this method was made a basis for the museum-focused approach. Also N.M. Karamzin was first to report to Russian readers about some Russian and European museums. I. Ye. Zabelin also greatly contributed to museology. His work on the life of Russian tsars and tsarinas in the 16th-17th centuries is still relevant. We can say that it is a model for the history of material culture as a special discipline of museology. N.M. Karamzin and I. Ye. Zabelin were followed by Russian historians and museum specialists who developed various questions on the history of some Russian museums and the museum science on the whole. There were prepared and published some museographic and archaeographic works on museums. D.A. Klements, N.F. Fedorov, N.M. Mogilyanskiy, B.F. Adler formulated the first definitions of the museum as a repository of memorials of the past. Such authors as P.S. Uvarova, V.E. Rudakov, A. I. Smirnov made the grouping of Russian museums, developed the first classification, made the experience of the indoors museum activities. In the 1900s, professor of Moscow archaeological institute S.K. Kuznetsov used the concept of museology for the first time. In accordance with context that wording clearly supposed the complex character of museology. Since the first years of Soviet power in Russia, active work for a change in the museum science began. The creation of a special agency for state management of museums in Narkomat for Education promoted that work. Museum specialists K.E. Grinevitch, N.G. Mashkovtsev and their colleagues spoke up for the restructuring of the museum science in their works. They offered to act in accordance with the revolutionary ideas, connected the museum science with tasks of Socialist building. Siberian authors N.K. Auerbakh and G.I. Cheremnykh asserted the idea of the scientific nature of museums, but still admitted the needs to connect museums with institutions for political education. By the end of the 1920s, the problems of the museum science and museology studies as well were included in the system of political knowledge. The MarxismLeninism concept was established in museology, and it characterized museums as centers of documentation and propaganda of Socialist building. It outlined the paradigm shift in museology.

AB This article uses data from the 1993-2011 national legislative elections in Russia in order to systematically measure and explain the dynamics of party system nationalization. The analysis registers a salient discrepancy between the extremely low levels of territorial homogeneity of the vote in the single-member plurality section of Russia's electoral system (1993-2003), on the one hand, and very high levels of party nationalization in party-list contests, on the other. This discrepancy, facilitated by such factors as the legacies of regime transition, federalism, and presidentialism, was reinforced by the integration of gubernatorial political machines into the nationwide political order, which ultimately resulted in unprecedentedly high levels of party nationalization in the 2007-2011 elections. The findings challenge a conventional theory that equates the formation of national electorates to the progressive process of party system consolidation, suggesting that under certain conditions, related but not reducible to the authoritarian perversion of the structure of electoral incentives, there is no such linear relationship.

AB The article is dedicated dedicated to the analysis of new agenda in the philosophy of science and technology that might be dubbed a "political turn". It consists in the problematizing science from the point of its cognitive autonomy; independence from history and culture; ethnic, gender and confession neutrality; disinterest in property and power. There are those concepts emerge like "science economy", "academical capitalism", "techno-science", "pop-science", "science as public good", "fraud science" that reflect the changing social status of science. The main argument confronts modernity and postmodernity, which in Russian tradition takes form of contrasting the classical world view with the non-classical one. Nowadays science can hardly be studied disregarding its locus within the political system. The means of internal and external science management gain prior significance. All this dramatically transforms the very disciplinary core of science. In the article, the presuppositions and consequences of the political turn are traced and problematized.

DT Review
DE Kosovo; Pristina; Symbolic Nation-building; Cultural Landscape;
   Commemoration
AB The paper is devoted to studying current strategies in the transformation of cultural landscape in postwar Kosovo. I regard cultural landscape, i.e. a piece of Earth's surface deliberately shaped by man, as an extension of the so-called socially constructed reality (Berger and Luckmann, 1966). In some cases this symbolization is a strategic part of a nation-building project, or just a way to declare one's own presence, identity, or affiliation. The creation of new heroes is one of the initial steps within the strategies of a nation-building process, as it forms an essential prerequisite for the feeling of a common and shared history. This article analyses the spectrum of personalities symbolically welcomed in Kosovo since the 1990s. The Republic of Kosovo is de jure a multiethnic society consisting of Albanian, Serbian, and other communities, and is presented as such to the international community. However, the current strategies of symbolic nation-building deeply contradict the declared aspirations to build a common state and national identity among all of the peoples living in Kosovo. My aim is to negotiate the strategies of memorialization in postwar Kosovo with a focus on this balancing between civic (as desired) and ethnic (as de facto realized) models of nation-building. The data for the study were collected during several fieldwork trips in Kosovo (2010-2014).

Posed in the article are methodological problems of comprehension of politics in the dimension of personality. New qualitative characteristics of modernity, new aspects of mutual influence of micro- and macropolitics are analyzed. Revealed in the context of such analysis is the tendency of individualization of politics as a possible alternative to man's "esape" from the world of the political. The authors introduce the notion of infomodernity presented as an image of new social reality organized by interactive net forms of virtual communication, and accentuate interest for the "human dimension" of this new reality.

AB To date, China's deliberative institutions have mainly been seen as small-scale mechanisms for controlling local social unrest. This paper explores how deliberative principles in China work at the national level. The case under scrutiny is China's new healthcare reform. Drawing on the existing empirical studies, Chinese-language reports and articles, official document analysis, and on several unstructured interviews with Chinese academics, the article attempts to evaluate the extent to which deliberative democratic principles are present in the process of healthcare policy making. To achieve this analytical goal, it develops and applies five criteria of good deliberation. The analysis suggests that the public policy process in China is now more inclusive and pluralistic than it was in the past. This arguably indicates that China's political system is moving in a new direction.

AB The tasks of concept formation for Russian society modernization have become more acute under conditions of global competition thus asking for a more active reaction of academic community. In the paper, some not trivial by far aspects of the issue are presented. Nonlinear character of modernization process is shown, and a mini-max strategy for Russia is suggested: priority for human bads minimization, first of all, for unbearable tribulations suffered by a considerable fraction of population, while, at the same time, as far as possible, increasing social goods of greatest significance for vital functions of over 50% majorities of population. To implement this strategy, institutional regulative rules have to be changed for vital activities of all population strata including higher levels of the political and business elites allowing for an integrated and coordinated implementation of interrelated technical, technological, social and economic as well as social cultural changes. This however ought to be done not per saltum but incrementally and differentially both nationwide and in each region considering real state of its modernization. Three basic stages of integrated modernization of Russian society are offered, as well as preliminary identification of the Russian Federation subjects with these stages.

AB Academic economists have a strong influence on political discourse in Russia by delivering through courses of "Economic theory" and "Institutional economics" very harmful conceptual elements for political discourse. This article proposes to change radically these courses in such a way that, instead of self-interest of the economic man, consideration of social relations exclusively through the prism of exchange, society and community as fictions, the state as a bandit and the opportunistic behavior as a norm, they would provide students with very different images of socio-economic interactions. Discursive paradigm in economics, the foundations of which were laid by John Commons, allows us to take another look at the institutions, transactions, contractual relationships, property, enterprises, and institutional change, and the contemporary communitarian philosophy (Michael Sandel, Alasdair Macintyre, Charles Taylor) and the historical, discursive and constructivist institutionalism in political science (Theda Skocpol, Vivien Schmidt, Colin Hay) make it possible to have different interpretations of the state, law, and civil society. This article calls for a return of institutional economics to the humanistic position of its founders and for a strong critic of the so-called "new institutional economics" and "new political economy". The author, following John Dewey, proposes to economists to feed by the results of their empirical research an enlarged political discourse, which will involve the general public. Among these empirical studies the institutional monitoring should play a central role. Performing institutional monitoring means doing research in the framework of the discursive paradigm, which is ontologically and epistemologically the adequate form of research for understanding the socio-economic-political realities.

AB Technological innovations are by no means Pareto-improving. I build on the argument that incumbent innovators can use political means to block rival innovations by emphasizing that the competitiveness of political system and some political institutions may diminish their ability to do so. I specify an institutional mechanism of agenda power, which provides newcomers with an improved ability to enter the game. The number of agenda power holders varies significantly among political systems, electoral systems, and administrative structures. With a sample of about 100 countries and across 20 years I show that politically competitive regimes, majoritarian electoral rules, and federal structures supply more holders of agenda power in comparison to their counterparts and, other things being equal, produce more innovations.

AB A changing and not always rewarding geopolitical reality forces major players of world economy to integrate sustainable principles and social responsibility in corporate and state strategy. These processes lead to a diverse institutionalization level of the overall social responsibility, particularly within politically and financially different systems of emerging markets economies. Some very clear examples of such systems are Russia and China where strategy of economic and social development is presumably based on principles of sustainable development. The balance of socio-economic and political systems requires a complex mechanism grounded on absolutely diverse historical, mental and other peculiarities.

AB The article investigates the problems that Russian industry has encountered during the period of economic reforms. The author explores the reasons for the competitiveness decrease and contradictions that hinder the modernization of the domestic industry. Based on the analysis the principal concept is posed of the need in the implementation of the strategy of re-industrialization in Russia on a new technological basis. The basic directions of re-industrialization, the mechanisms of its implementation, as well as the impact on import substitution are considered. Substantial attention is paid to the risks inherent in a re-industrialization of Russia and the ways to overcome them. In recent years, geo-political and geo-economic challenges to the Russian economy and society greatly exacerbated the contradictions that emerged in the previous decades of economic evolution. During a long period of time the country tried to implement an economic policy intended, in principle, at achieving the strategic goal of creating a modern socially-oriented market economy on the base of modernization. However, the practical tools for implementation of this course - first of all, the ideology of "market fundamentalism" combined with the remaining powerful black market and "hand steering" by the government - caused stagnation and further de-industrialization of the country with inevitably negative implications for the manufacturing, science, education, human capital. Most recently, the Russian economy faced additional problems, namely, the Western sanctions, world economic slump and decline in world oil prices. That is why significant changes in the objectives and tools of economic policy are so urgent.

DT Article
DE political regimes; transformation of regimes; political relations;
   political interaction; political strategy; neopatrimonialism; hegemony;
   partnership; domination; political crises; conflicts; conflict dynamics
AB This article is a double thought experiment answering to the following questions: 1) how far one can go in explaining the dynamics of political regimes and transitions between them on the basis of an abstract theory, including a small number of basic categories and postulates; 2) what is the heuristical potential of the theory in explaining the nature of neopatrimonial regimes. The Weberian paradigm of four social spheres is used (administrative, military, economic and ideological / cultural / religious). These areas correspond to the social universals: power, violence, property and symbols. When combined with a functional scheme of A. Stinchcombe they are explicated as homeostatic variables: the main objects of concern of social actors. The concepts of political regime, political relations, political interaction, routine and conflict strategies are defined. Transformation of political regime is determined by the change in its core complex of political relations. The conditions of a regime crisis as a conflict between actors for which the levels of basic homeostatic variables become unacceptable (from isolation and full domination to equal partnership and integration) are considered, as well as the laws of formation of each such type of relationship. Patrimony as an antithesis of bureaucracy is always reborn and enhanced by weakening the state and its formal rules and institutions. The nature of neopatrimonialism includes a core patrimony (the network of patronage ties) and the declarative shell of formal democratic institutions which are constructed on impersonal formal principles of bureaucracy.

TI THE THEORY OF INTERMEDIALITY IN THE CONTEXT OF MODERN HUMANITIES
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE intermediality; media; digital culture
AB The theory of intermediality is a relevant scientific field attracting an increasing number of researchers in recent years. Such interest is quite natural, because intermediality meets the basic tendencies of modern humanities: the pursuit of interdisciplinarity; high interest in the problems of the media against the background of the active development of digital culture; search for fresh methodological approaches that are appropriate to the new cultural realities. Nevertheless, for all the indisputable merits of the theory, we can say that it contains a number of "fleeting" places that, despite the rather serious developments, so far have not received a final solution and significantly slow down the pace of development of the theory. In particular, at the moment there is no consensus on the conceptual framework of intermediality, in connection with the observed mobility of the typological borders covering a wide variety of conditions (from language arts to political strategies) and the principles of their interaction (multimodality, media convergence and integration, synthesis, crossing, etc.). In turn, intermediality is open to a wide range of the humanities (the theory of communications and cultural studies, philosophy, literature and music theory, art history, film studies, etc.), which makes it difficult to develop a universal method of intermediality analysis. In this paper, the existing points of view on key issues of intermediality (terminology, history, typology and perspectives) are analyzed in order to determine its current state and prospects for the future and establish the place of Russian studies in the general intermedial context. It is particularly significant since domestic science, with its rich tradition in the field of comparative and structural semiotic research (A. Mikhailov, Bakhtin, Lotman, Ilyin et al.), learnt about the theory of intermediality not so long ago (since the 2000s), so the theory is not so widespread in Russia as abroad. It is concluded that a broad approach to the understanding of intermediality and its role in addressing issues of the media continues to be relevant in the humanities today. The ambiguity of the concept "media" highly sought after by modern science has identified three key vectors in the study of intermediality: media technological, cultural-aesthetic and social-communicative. In addition, the potential inherent in it is not to determine this theory as the prerogative of any single discipline. At the same time, there is a growing trend of no search for universal methods of studying intermedial phenomena towards increased specialization, i.e the formation of terminology and methodological principles particularly for various scientific fields. In this respect, broad prospects open up for domestic researchers since intermediality is mainly represented by works on literary criticism in Russia.

TI THE RUSSIANS AND THE "RUSSIAN WORLD": THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT AND THE
   CONTEMPORARY INTERPRETATION
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian identity; self-identification; identity; Crimea; "Russian world"
AB The authors focus on the clarification of the essence of modern Russian identity. Appealing to the fact that the reunification with Crimea brought the well-known "Russian reunification" discourse to the public sphere, the authors try to consider the main attributes of the "Russianness", the cultural and mythological components of the Russian identity. It is especially important now when the government implements the discourse of the "Russian world" as a foreign policy doctrine, involving the selected status for ethnic Russians. However, the data of the numerous studies reveals that Russians living abroad are less integrated into the identity of the "Russians of the mainland". Applying to the data of the sociological surveys, the authors fix that "Russianness" as a political myth, is rather loose, declarative, and gives no basis neither for the solidary actions, nor for the legal political formation of the Russian nationalism. Symbols of the solidary action and pride of Russian identity traditionally mix with the Soviet past. However, today the Soviet identity gradually loses its rootedness, while alternative grounds of national solidarity, like the development of science, education, culture, the presence of high social standards, are still absent. Today, in the situation of a request for a new solidarity identity mythology "Russianness" is one of the basic myths. But what will be lying behind the Russian consciousness after the "Russian spring"?

TI URBANIZATION DYNAMICS IN EGYPT: FACTORS, TRENDS, PERSPECTIVES
SO ARAB STUDIES QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
DE Egypt; urbanization; migration; economic growth; forecasts;
   sociopolitical de stabilization
AB The article analyzes the specifics of urbanization dynamics in Egypt, which is noteworthy for a number of reasons. First, there was a shift from the logistic trend in the 1970s, and the share of urban population stopped growing. The UN data analysis shows that such a shift usually occurs against the background of very serious economic difficulties (and other problems associated with them). However, the urban population proportion stopped growing in Egypt when the country was experiencing a period of exceedingly rapid economic growth. We find labor migration of unprecedented scale to be the main reason which engendered this seemingly paradoxical situation. We further proceed to analyze the UN forecast on the dynamics of the Egyptian urban population proportion up to 2050, which implies a return to the logistic trend and rapid growth of the urban population share, which is fraught with socio-political instability risks. However, we present data proving that the logistic urbanization trajectory is not inevitable for Egypt, and the destabilization risks connected with the rapid increase of urban population share are largely irrelevant to Egypt in the forecasted period.

TI GEOGRAPHY AND ECONOMY OF THE KALININGRAD REGION: LIMITATIONS AND

SO BALTIC REGION
LA English
DT Article
DE exclave; cross-border; economy; open economic zone; the Kaliningrad
   region
AB Being an axclave, the Kaliningrad region has been drawing attention of many researchers in different fields. Yet the prospects for cooperation between the region and neighbouring communities in Poland and Lithuania, which once constituted an integrated social, economic and political space, remain unclear. Media analysts and scholars alike tend to view the Kaliningrad region as "double periphery", since it is excluded from major modernisation processes both in the European integration zone and in the Russian Federation. However, a detailed study involving polyscale socioeconomic indices, expert interviews, and surveys run contrary to this viewpoint. A look at the key indices of the Kaliningrad region and the neighbouring communities of Poland and Lithuania showed that both socioeconomic situation and standards of living are comparable in these areas, which indicates the prerequisites for mutually beneficial interregional cooperation. We have analysed factual information on socioeconomic development of cross-border regions and surveyed the students from the leading universities of Gdansk, Kaliningrad and Klaipeda. We were thus able to conclude that the reasons behind the delapidated cross-border relations are rather subjective and lie in the field of geopolitical orientation, information and institutional policy, as well as persistent stereotypes that shape public opinion. In this light, integration between the Kaliningrad region and mainland Russia is seen not only as an economic, but also as a sociocultural objective. An analysis of the stages of the region's exclavisation, and policies of social support stemming from the uniqueness of the economic and geographical position of the region substantiate this conclusion.

LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGY; THINKING; STALIN; UNION
AB Research within the history of economic thought has focused only little on the development of economics under dictatorship. This paper attempts to show how a country with a relatively large and internationally established community of social scientists in the 1920s, the Soviet Union, was subjected to repression. We tell this story through the case of Isaak Il'ich Rubin, a prominent Russian economist and historian of economic thought, who in the late 1920s was denounced by rival scholars and repressed by the political system. By focusing not only on his life and work, but also on that of his opponents and institutional clashes, we show how the decline of a social science tradition in Russia and the USSR as well as the Stalinization of Soviet social sciences emerged as a process over time. We analyze the complex interplay of ideas, scholars, and their institutional context, and conclude that subsequent repression was arbitrary, suggesting that no clear survival or career strategy existed in the Stalinist system, due to a situation of fundamental uncertainty.

ID TRADE-POLICY; EQUILIBRIUM; MODEL
AB With fast-track authority (FTA), the US Congress delegates trade-policy authority to the president by committing not to amend a trade agreement. Why would it cede such power? We suggest an interpretation in which Congress uses FTA to forestall destructive competition between its members for protectionist rents. In our model: (i) FTA is never granted if an industry operates in the majority of districts; (ii) The more symmetric the industrial pattern, the more likely is FTA, since competition for protectionist rents is most punishing when bargaining power is symmetrically distributed; (iii) Widely disparate initial tariffs prevent free trade even with FTA.

Analysis of land reform, which started in 1990, shows what actions and what logic led the land sector in the state in which it was at the finish line of the quarter-century reform marathon. The reform process was not linear, it highlighted the steps differing objectives and strategies to achieve them. Land reform is presented as a struggle of different political forces, which were reflected in the redistribution of functions between agencies in lobbying for appointment to senior positions promoted various commands. The authors conclude about the gradual displacement of state regulation of land relations, the deliberate destruction of the land management as a basis for the development of land resources.

DT Article
DE Russian studies; Slavic studies; ethnolinguistics; semantic derivation;
   Russian dialectal vocabulary; phraseology; derivatives of toponyms
AB The article considers the reconstruction of the linguistic image of the Russian capital (Moscow) and its inhabitants (mainly in subdialects and the colloquial language). This image is studied with reference to the data of foreign languages and dialects, mainly, Slavic (especially East Slavic) languages as well as Romance and Germanic, Turkic and Finno-Ugric. The linguistic image is based on the analysis of words derived from the name of the Russian capital as a result of semantic derivation, as well as set expressions with such words (e.g. Russian dialectal moskvichka for 'milksop, lover of soft jobs', namoskalit'sya for 'learn to cheat', Ukrainian colloquial moskal'ske kaparstvo for 'Moscow (Russian) slapdash, disorder', Polish dialectal moskal for 'cabbage soup', English Muscovy lantern for 'lantern made with Muscovy glass', Swedish Moscovit for 'coat or raincoat with a Russian cut worn in the 1800'). The authors take into account the fact that in foreign languages, derivatives of the toponym in question do not only reflect the idea of Moscow, but, largely, of Russia as a whole. The article is the second part of a two-part sequence of articles on the topic. It studies the popular idea of the inhabitant of Moscow, the material and spiritual culture of the capital, as well as the economic and political aspects of its image. The analysis enables the authors to reveal the motivation of the words and idioms formed from the name of the capital. Additionally, the authors compare the national Russian and non-Russian perception of Moscow and its inhabitants. It is argued that, e.g., the national image of the Muscovite has a positive concept while the perception of the inhabitant of Moscow by foreigners is negative and is explained by its connection to the perception of Russians as occupant soldiers.

SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russia; sociological survey; public opinion; foreign policy priorities;
   Cold War; the West; the East; Europe; great power; global threats
AB The authors' research interests are focused at the analysis of the actual views of the Russians on the international reality and the place of Russia in it. The scholars pay special attention to the long-term dynamics of foreign policy orientations and views of citizens that have undergone serious transformation during the last few years under influence of the revaluation of Russia's place in the world and the character of its relations with the states of near and far abroad as well as of the revaluation of the international status of the state in the 21st century, as changes in the domestic politics. In order to achieve this goal, the authors gradually solve several research tasks, studying - on the basis of extensive sociological data - the Russians' core values in the sphere of the country's foreign policy strategy, its relation to the Western states, cooperation and collaboration. The authors formulate an important idea: if some 10-15 years ago, the category of the "West" was associated largely with the United States, nowadays, Europe as presented by NATO and the EU is perceived by Russians as an integrated with the U.S.A. symbiosis that is antagonistic to Russia. While backing the foreign policy course of the state leaders, the Russians, however, worry about the escalating tensions with the West. Most of them believe that Russia and the United States are coming back to the Cold War times. It was revealed that the level of mass confidence to the Europe, especially to the EU, is decreasing, that eventually leads to an increase of the number of Russians who doubt in ability of our state to be part of the European civilization and believe that modern Russia has a special vector of development. While speaking on the goals of the global policy of Russia, citizens tended to support the idea of Russia's revival as a great power. But this idea is not associated with the revanchist sentiments or the nationalistic hysteria. The bulk of Russians consider that the status of the leading world power should be achieved by Russia not by means of an aggressive foreign policy, but by solving political, social, economic, and cultural problems, by guarantying of welfare and safety to its citizens. Evaluating the impact of the recent foreign policy developments on the mass Russian consciousness, the authors draw a conclusion that the myth of the "Russian imperialism," triggered by events in the Crimea and South-Eastern Ukraine, is seriously excessive. Today, we are witnessing a dropping number of those Russians who believe that the goal of Russia's revival as a superpower is realistic. Today, Russians tend to stick to a more realistic goal for Russia to join the most economically developed and politically influential world states. Post-reform generation of our citizens actually have no illusions about the real intentions of some Russia's international partners in the world. At the same time, they are devoid of a "besieged fortress" syndrome. The vast majority of Russians support the idea of international cooperation, but only such a cooperation that has a positive impact on the well-being of the state. This attitude seems to remain dominant in the near future.

AB This article employs a comprehensive set of data on 226 regional legislative elections held in Russia in 1999-2011 in order to assess the impact of electoral authoritarianism upon women's representation in sub-national legislative bodies. The analysis of 50,520 cases of candidate nomination and 9553 cases of electoral success, supported by a cross-regional statistical study of the factors of women's nomination and success, empirically confirms an explanatory model that incorporates three working hypotheses derived from the mainstream literature on women's representation. According to this model, the 2002-2003 electoral reform, by introducing proportional representation into regional electoral systems, strongly facilitated women's representation. After the advent of electoral authoritarianism, proportional rules, in combination with the increased party magnitude' of the pro-government party, continued to exert expectedly positive effects; yet these effects were offset by the decreased competitiveness in majority districts. As a result, political regime transformation did not lead to a significant increase in the number of female deputies.

AB Innovation activity is now acknowledged as the basis for successful development. However, many industries, regions and countries have got bitter experience of creating innovative clusters and encouraging innovative activity. Many attempts failed in spite of seemingly favourable conditions and factors for successful innovations in these areas. This is true for the regions of Russia as well. The immediate aim of the present study was to identify those areas (municipalities) of Perm Kray that possess high innovation susceptibility in terms of new developments and creation of innovative cluster.

AB The authors examine how the Russian judiciary formulates legal policies when adjudicating cases in which religious beliefs are concerned. First, the authors describe the framework within which their research on this matter is conducted, basing it on the theory of legal argumentation. Applying this framework to the investigation of Russian court practice has enabled the authors to discover important features, which they argue are characteristic of legal reasoning of the judiciary in this category of cases. In particular, the authors note that, at least until the present, the Russian Constitutional Court has chosen to abstain from crafting principles of legal policy regarding religious issues. Furthermore, in religious cases, the Russian judiciary-by and large-does not follow the jurisprudence of the ECtHR, and the Russian Supreme Court has no clear-cut policy in handling these cases. In such a situation, ordinary judges choose individual strategies. These are indispensable insomuch as fidelity to the letter of the law is inadequate for adjudicating such cases. Russian court practice (from 1997 on) in religious cases can be more easily understood from this perspective than it can in the light of presumed political influence.

DE radical pedagogy; radicalism
AB The article is devoted to theoretical problem of methodological character that is how to the form a new pedagogical concept, dubbed "radical pedagogy". The authors note the ambiguity of the definition of this term and the various vectors of considering the problems of radicalism in pedagogical projection. On the basis of theoretical and historical analysis it is shown that the ideas of the radical reconstruction of the education system and teaching practices have deep historical roots. In modern pedagogy the concept of "radical pedagogy" is understood in two ways. It is defined by some theorists as the notion that secures the changing views about cognitive capacities, conditions, and factors forming human exposure that indicates the system of pedagogical measures and solutions. The second group of researchers interprets this term as an uncompromising commitment to achieve real transformation in accordance with the views on the development of socio-political, ideological and economic spheres. On the basis of content-analytical study of special publications of the journal "Radical Pedagogy" it is shown that currently, this conceptualization is in the stage of intensive growth.

   economy; Russia; Soviet Union; Thorstein Veblen
ID HETERODOX ECONOMICS; SOCIOLOGY
AB This inquiry explores and details the slowed and often thwarted development of institutional thought in Russia, and then its later flourishing. I use Alexandr Akhiezer's term of "inversion cycles" as a way to frame the inquiry, and relatedly, I divide the arrival and advancement of the institutional field of inquiry into two distinct phases, with the first defined as a Thwarted Phase that becomes evident in the 1930s. At the first phase (1930-80-s) there was a complete negation of both the old institutionalism and the new institutionalism. The Flourishing Phase commences with the start of the 1990s and continues up to the present. At that stage we can see a broad and uncritical absorption of institutional economics ideas. I draw relationships with how some of the long term effects stemming from the October Revolution of 1917, the founding of the USSR in 1921, and the tradition of dialectical materialism derived from Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, effectively thwarted the institutional approach to Economic Science for almost all of the Soviet era. The Flourishing Phase can be distinguished by the start of the transition to market economy, the emergence of independent presses, and the translation of key institutionalist documents, plus the dissemination of articles and books authored by Russian scholars3/4with some reaching into university curriculums. Relatedly, and in conclusion, I offer insights into the prospects for the emergence of a distinct "Russian Institutionalism" and based upon original contributions from Russian scholars relying upon contemporary methodological principles.

DE ethnopolitical processes; interethnic relations; comparative analysis;
   identity; post-Soviet states; Russia; Belarus; Kazakhstan; Ukraine
AB Analyzed in the article are the key trends of ethnopolitical and ethnosocial development in the largest post-Soviet states - Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The criteria and foundations of such comparative analysis are formulated and the main problems of nation building in post-Soviet states are shown. Special attention is paid to the relationship between ethnic and civic components of identity, as well as to the identity policy in every state in question. It is mentioned that the formation of civic identity and civil society in post-Soviet countries is a very difficult process. To a large extent these difficulties are caused by the unfinished processes of nation-building and by the ineffective political and economic institutions. It is demonstrated that situation in the field of interethnic relations and in the sphere of national identity is quite different in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The consolidation of polyethnic nation and the formation of civic identity in Russian Federation is a rather slow process; however, the country possesses important long-term traditions of identity policy and interethnic conflicts regulation. In Belarus, the Soviet identity dominated in the 1990's and the 2000's, while nowadays the new generation wishes to form its own national identity. President Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan tries to shape a complex identity in order to stabilize the social and political situation. This complex identity includes ethnic, national and supranational (so-called Eurasian) components. It is concluded that the experience of formation of such complex identity is useful for Russia and other post-Soviet states. Just the opposite, the social and cultural situation in Ukraine is very difficult: the country undergoes a serious social and ethnic polarization, which invokes political confrontation. These processes result in the crisis of Ukrainian statehood and in different social, political and interethnic conflicts.

DT Article
DE democracy; political institutions; civil society; participation;
   political activity; social activity; public-private partnership;
   self-government; local communities
AB The article is devoted to the study of problem of the evolution as of the democratic values in the structure of the mass consciousness of Russian citizens as of different forms of political and non-political participation. The authors stress that contemporary Russia faces the deep institutional crisis that, from one side, leads to establishment of the government ownership of many structures of the civil societies' structures, and from the other side that stimulates emergence and development of the varied self-organization practices of the civil initiatives and horizontal communication connections. From this point of view, the availability of formal democratic institutions, that are often imitational or "frozen", is better than their total absence, because one can find here the ability to return rapidly to the early democratic practices and to transform into the new actual initiatives.
   It is also noted in the article that the decrease of the interest of Russian citizens to the "great politics", that is fixing by mass polls especially among youngsters, is accompanied by latent polarization of the vast segments of various subcultures and non-formal organizations. At the same time, one can also find the opposite tendency - of "socialization" of political movements. For this reason the authors conclude that the recession of the protest activity is not the same as the recession of the political and social activity in the state. Rather one can talk about the redistribution of the flows of activity that can be fixed as in the forms as in the objects of its realization.
   The authors also analyze the attitude of the Russian citizens to the different forms and practices of the "social and state partnership". As the authors note, Russian citizens almost totally perceive as the "social and state partnership" the initiatives in the social sphere (health care, education, active aging, adaptation of the socially vulnerable groups) and such spheres of co-participation as the environment protection activity, civil rights and philanthropy initiatives. The option "dialog between generations" has here the unexpectedly high rating (30%). This could probably be caused by the belief that traditional institutes of retranslation of the generations' experience (school, family, media) couldn't solve this problem and should be amplified with civil institutes, public opinion leaders, new forms of communication etc. At the same time, constructive interaction between state bodies and social institutes is possible just if being based, firstly, on the partition of the influence spheres, that is convenient for both sides, and, secondly, when applying more actively than today to the institutions that functionally focus on such interaction (these are mainly local self-government bodies and various local communities). But as the authors note, that could be done not when their activity would be radically rebuild (one could remember lots of such rebuilding' attempts), but due to the overcoming of duality of the local self-government bodies, that leads to the situation of the "self-management without self-organization". The authors argue the need for establishment of the local authority bodies with the clearly defined powers and at the same time with the various canals, technologies and forms of socially independent action, that closely interact as with it as with each others. Special attention in the article is paid to the analyses of possible mechanisms of reaching of this goal, firstly, by the creation of the conditions of the real inclusion of persons into the process of the municipal management.

AB The issue of social inequalities is analyzed as a global issue of modernity. Social inequalities are emphasized to differ by natural historical dimension; they are reproduced in rather stable forms as a reflection of political, economic, cultural normative structure of a society being thus immanent for all phases of societal historical development. Inequalities represent specific form of social differentiation, pre-determining differences in vital conditions for individuals and social groups mediating for them different chances to satisfy actual demands and interests. Character, causes, depth, and specifics of social inequalities in post-Soviet Russia are discussed on the bases of all-Russia surveys between 2003 and 2013; main indices and social economic factors of the inequalities are elicited. Thinking patterns of Russians are analyzed regarding just and unjust, legitimate and illegitimate, as well as excessive inequalities. Destabilizing role of illegitimate inequalities is stressed as a barrier to Russia's progressive development.

ID LATE MIDDLE KINGDOM
AB This paper focuses on the emergence of the Theban kingdom of Dynasty 16 in the Second Intermediate Period and explores the historical repercussions of its assumed struggle with the declining state of Dynasty 13 centered at Itjtawy. A revision of the recent evidence from Edfu raises doubts about the alleged contemporaneity of Sobekhotep iv and Khayan. A survey of administrative titles in the sources pertaining to the Theban kingdom testifies that it arose independently based on the local power structures of the Late Middle Kingdom rather than because of a relocation from the north. The separation of the nascent Theban kingdom from the state of Dynasty 13 and a surmised consequent confrontation between these entities had an impact on the ideology of the new polity and influenced the policy of its direct successor- the state of Dynasty 17 and the early New Kingdom. The original lack of legitimacy of Dynasty 16 could have been one of the reasons for overstating the power of the Hyksos in historical texts- in order to justify Theban claims to rule in Middle and Lower Egypt.

TI THE SECOND PLAGUE PANDEMIC IN THE GOLDEN HORDE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES
SO ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW
LA Russian
DT Article

AB The article reviews the reasons for origin and consequences of spreading for the second plague pandemic in the Golden Horde. By applying scientific data from biology, climatology, medicine, and history, authors come to a conclusion that a large number of natural plague pestholes existed initially in the Ulus of Jochi. Numerous historical sources mentioned plague outbreaks but all of them were of purely local character. The bubonic type of plague characterized by a longer period of illness and an insignificant number of lethal episodes was spread more widely. In the mid-40s of the 14th century a new form of disease, the lung plague, came into existence. It was corpse blackening of the deceased from this type of plague that gave name to the whole pandemic -the "Black Death". The speed of its progress and spreading significantly exceeded those of the bubonic type and 100% of mortality was recorded among the diseased. However, as historical data show, the outbreak of the lung plague continued in the territory of the Golden Horde from 1346 to 1349. In their article authors prove that one of the most important reasons for the emergence of the lung type was the change in migration flows of Eurasian rodents caused by depletion of nutritional resources in the steppe and serious climatic changes. All other outbreaks of the Black Death are viewed as continuation of the first wave of the disease and their emergence is explained through activity of two natural pestholes (the Relict North-Western and the Lower Volga ones). Consequences of the the first wave were much less substantial for the Ulus of Jochi than those of the following outbreaks (in 1364, 1374, and 1395). The main consequences of the next waves of the disease were: final establishment of 4 political centers (Grand Duchy of Moscow, the Bulgar and the Crimean uluses, and the Blue Horde) striving for political leadership in the territory of the former Golden Horde; establishment of a new ethnic group of the Volga Tatars; and strengthening of Islam's position in the region.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the range of questions connected with political radicalism and its extreme form terrorism and also their reflection in a scientific projection. In Post-Soviet Russia, political terrorism is a new political problem connected with tendencies to separatism of certain regions and territories and is poorly investigated and therefore not understood as a social, psychological and cultural phenomenon. The article considers this new phenomenon in the context of modern theories of political violence. It deals with the carried out chronological comparison of official statistical data on the quantity of acts of terrorism and intensity of scientific researches of problems of radicalism and terrorism for this period. On the basis of the content analysis of research activity of scientists the article reveals the problematic distinctions in the publications of professional academic magazines. The author claims that Russian periodic scientific press hasn't fully used the potential of timely, expeditious, preventive discussion of problems of terrorism. The share of publications considers the problems of tolerance consciousness formation, instead of counteraction to terrorism and localization of its preconditions. Discussion of the problems of radicalism has late effect. On the basis of the content analysis of dissertation researches (2000 2012) on radicalism and terrorism problems in the context of chronology of terrorism acts it is claimed that their maximum falls on the period of the minimum number of terrorism acts. Researchers fail to pay enough attention to the discussion of actual issues of terrorism in the regions of the Islamic right and culture (in the North Caucasus) within political science, law, sociology, philosophy. The psychology and pedagogics take the latest place in development of this perspective at dissertation level, but they take the leading place in publications of the scientific periodical press.

DT Article
DE economic sanctions; types of sanctions; efficiency of sanctions;
   economy; external debt; foreign investments; capital; Russia
AB The article considers in details the economic sanctions imposed in 2014-2015 against Russian Federation by the governments of USA, EU and some other nations. First of all, the author gives a theoretical and historic background of the problem, in particular, classification of the main types of economic sanctions applied in the world, the issues of their legitimacy and effectiveness, as well as the concrete experiences of the recent decades. On this basis an in-depth analysis of their immediate impact on the Russian economy and its future development is elaborated. Particular attention is paid to the influence of sanctions on the investment situation in the Russian economy. It is concluded that the current sanctions contributed to an increase of the inflation rate, deteriorated the investment prospects and stimulated capital outflow. They promoted depreciation of Ruble and reduction of the Russian international reserves, worsened the conditions for servicing the external debt. Along with sanctions, a strong effect on the state of the Russian economy was produced by the drop in international oil prices. These two factors accelerated the onset of economic recession in this country. However, it is stated that the fundamental factors of ongoing recession lie not in the cooling of political relations with Western governments or in the volatility of market prices but in an unsatisfactory institutional structure of the domestic economy. Respectively, the economic prospects of Russia for the nearest year are evaluated by the author as unfavorable. Further extension of sanctions will lead to further worsening of Russia's investment attractiveness, braking down of the structural adjustments and technological development. It will also narrow opportunities for the Russian companies in their efforts to establish cooperative relations with the leading foreign counterparts and to integrate into the global value-added chains (VACs). Since the role of transnational production in the world economy is on the increase, the extent of participation in VACs will define the position of the country in the world market. Continuing difficulties in this area will deteriorate long-term prospects of the economic development of Russia. Generally, it is stated that even though the recent sanctions have not played a decisive role in the current recession their influence is quite notable. Most importantly, they brought to surface the fundamental structural problems that hold back a steady economic development of Russia.

AB Acknowledgements. Research has been implemented in the framework of NRU HSE Program of Fundamental Studies in 2015 with support of Russian Scientific Foundation, Project. 14-18-03615. The so-called Arab spring of 2011 did not pass by Yemen. As it became clear later on, it triggered a chain of events leading up to cardinal changes in the country's destiny. It would be wrong, however, to call the 2011 turmoil a revolution since it failed to bring about a fundamental social and political transformation. This was achieved later, in 2014-2015, when a vigorous social protest was accompanied by an outburst of tribalism as the Shiite Houthi movement dared to challenge the long-standing domination of powerful traditional clans that used to be represented by President Salih who lost his position but kept trying to ensure a comeback. In a completely new and surprising configuration of forces Salih made an alliance with the Houthites who succeeded in quickly overrunning most of the country. These events, unlike the 2011 events, can be branded a genuine revolution. The situation was aggravated by the increased activity of "Al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula" and the separatist movement in the South. As the Houthites appeared to be winning, Saudi Arabia began a large scale military intervention aimed at preventing Yemen from becoming a Shia-dominated state and possibly an Iranian stooge. As a result of the Saudi air bombardment, contours of a serious international conflict have been shaping up .

DT Editorial Material
DE Early Slavs; Slavic 'tribes'; Slavic Ethnonyms; early Old-Russian
   Chronicles; archaeology of Eastern Europe
AB The article provides an overview of Old-Russian, Byzantine, Latin, Arabic and Jewish-Khazar texts of the 10th - the beginning of the 12th century, in which there are mentions of ethnonyms, which can be considered as the names of Slavic "tribal" communities. These historical evidences ("Bavarian Geographer", the letter of the Khazar king Joseph, a treatise "De Administrando Imperio", Primary Chronicle and some others) are researched with the help of text's critics to define their historical authenticity. Special attention is paid to the coincidences of these texts, which are a key argument for the reality of denotation-societies behind these designation-ethnonyms. Particular attention is focused on verifying and assessing the reliability of the historical and geographical information about Slavic "tribes" in the early Old Russian Chronicles. The paper collects and examines historical and linguistic data about the key Slavic communities of Eastern Europe (Polyane, Ulichi, Drevljane, Krivichi, Sloveni and some others). Separately the archaeological information about the areas for which they were located in the 10th-11th centuries is reviewed. It is concluded that behind the equal ethnonyms in terms of language and literary context of earlier chronicles can be "hidden" different types of communities (political, territorial or others). In some cases it is impossible to determine the type of community-denotation even hypothetically (for example, Dregovichi). There is no reason to date the emergence of any community much earlier fixing its name, the names of its leaders or other onomastic markers in the written sources.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE the world economy; Russia; China; foreign policy; economic belt of the
   "Silk Road" and "Maritime Silk Road of XXI century"
AB The article discusses the conditions under which the Russian "turn to the East" is implemented. It emphasizes that the basis for the "turn" is the Russian-Chinese relations. However, there are a lot of intense changes in the foreign policy of China itself - it becomes the primary tool for economic growth support. The main characteristics of the emerging concept of China's foreign policy are: raise of military power of China, "Investment attack" on emerging markets, consolidation of regional "zones of new influence of China", development of the "new type" relations with the US. These features make the behavior of China in defence of their own interests more aggressive (including relations with Russia). Therefore, Russian innovation in the field of geo-economic strategy must be adapted to the new elements of Chinese foreign policy. Despite the status of a "strategic partnership" a number of problems have developed between China and Russia in recent years. Main of them are: lack of trust because of the unwillingness to provide to each other full political and military-political support, and non-optimal consideration of the United States factor in relations between Russia and China. This presupposes the partial "strategic partnership" only. However, the "new interest" of China in Russia is becoming more urgent since China uses Russian "turn to the East" for its own strategic purposes. It is impossible not to see that China refused to support Western sanctions not due to political solidarity with Russia but due to the Chinese business interests protection. China is developing plans of entering into those sectors and niches of the Russian economy, which are released as a result of leaving or "non-arrival" of the Western capital. The "turn to the East" strategy (which means the "turn to China") can soften the internal losses of Russia from the "war of sanctions" with the West, but will not replace the Russian-American cooperation in the sphere of strategic stability, nuclear nonproliferation, space, terrorism, climate change.

DT Article
DE Novgorod; writing; written culture; annals; chronicles; annalistic
   writing; Middle Ages; Old Rus'
AB The author studies key moments in the history of early Novgorodian annalistic writing in the context of other written practices in Novgorod. The first, very brief annalistic notes were made by clerics of the St. Sophia Cathedral in the middle of the 11th century, at the time when, in Novgorod, writing was becoming part of the everyday life of clerics as well as of the lay elite and the administration. The first systematic historical works (an annalistic compilation and a collection of lists) appear in the 1090s, when we see the spread of book production beyond St. Sophia and the start of the mass usage of princely seals. The beginning of the systematic keeping of annalistic records in the 1110s was probably stimulated by the creation and the revisions of the Primary Chronicle in Kiev but, at the same time, it is around 1117 that the posadnik's seal appears, and this reflects a shift in the political balance in Novgorod. The 1130s were the time when the earliest extant documents granting lands, incomes, and privileges to church institutions were issued, and some other innovations in written culture also took place at around that time. In 1132 the annals previously kept for the prince passed to the control of the archbishop. Their content changed and official accusations relating to the behavior of princes began to be included. Thus, it was in the 1130s that the rights, privileges, and mutual positions of the actors in Novgorodian politics started to be fixed in writing.

AB The Institute for the History of Science and Technology (in transliterated Russian Institut Istorii Estestavoznaniya I Tekhniki, or IIET in abbreviation) in Moscow, along with its branch in St. Petersburg, is the largest research centre for history of science and technology in Russia. Its story encompasses a period of great change for Russia and as such includes tales of infighting and intrigue as well as many instances of academic achievement. This paper will focus on two peculiar characteristics of the institute's story in order to clarify the typical political contexts in which it had to operate and the way it succeeded to adapt itself to the varying situations. The first is the 2012 celebration of its 80th anniversary, which took place only 4 years after the institute had celebrated its 55th anniversary. Why did the different celebrators apparently have a different history in mind? Secondly, on several occasions the institute employed people for political rather than academic reasons: for these people the institute was a good, interesting or inconspicuous place to work during that time. This policy served the institute well on the whole. Even though in different political constellations the institute had to produce scholarship with different aims - sometimes the output had to contribute to the glory of the nation, in other times to analyse the role of science in a socialist society - the IIET produced excellent research. Today, once again, the institute stands on the threshold of change as it faces new threats to its existence.

First of all it is the double-headed eagle known from the descriptions of the monumental sculptures and the information about the territorial symbols of Galich and Volynian Rus'. Depicting the appearance of Daniel the chronicler witnesses the unusual case of bearing "Greek olovir". This special term meant "real" or "imperial" purple.

AB Unlike most Russian urban settings, Tomsk, located at the heart of Western Siberia is the University town. Tomsk State University founded in 1878 and it was the first institution of higher education beyond the Ural Mountains. At present, six national universities located in Tomsk form the basis of both the local economy and community. The universities attract students not only from the city of Tomsk and Tomsk region but from the other regions of Russia and from abroad. The percent of the student population in Tomsk is third biggest in the nation, giving the lead to Moscow and St. Petersburg only, practically each fifth person in Tomsk is the student, 50% of the students are from out of town, 9% are foreigners.
   Obviously the university students, being investors into the area, do affect social and economic life in both, the city itself and the region. Therefore, the important regional task is to keep "the cream of the cream" in the region.
   The article is dedicated to the life plans of students of the universities of Tomsk, namely their employment, educational and mobility plans.
   The article is based upon the results of sociological research, performed by the Departments of Sociology and Social work of Tomsk State University in September and October 2013 in the city of Tomsk.

AB The article focuses on the complex political, legal, sociocultural and geopolitical problems initiated by the political crisis in Ukraine. The authors analyze the historical and socio-political prerequisites and the global context of the Ukrainian crisis. In the light of this crisis, prospects of the geopolitical and geoeconomic reconfiguration of the former Soviet Union are considered. Special attention is paid to the problems of state consolidation, to the dysfunctions of the democratic process, to the efficiency of democratic political institutions. The transformations of the constitutional and legal system and of political regime are analyzed in the context of the current crisis. Risks of state insolvency and possible disintegration of Ukraine, prospects of reestablishment of the state as an option of crisis recovery, destructive practices of the post-revolutionary period, and the role of informal institutes in Ukrainian policy are evaluated. These factors contribute to a rapid growth of cleavages in the Ukrainian society in many respects because of the ethnic centered nation building policy and of xenophobic mobilization. Comparative analysis of the Ukrainian and Russian experiences post-Soviet transformation of political systems reveals two different variants of interaction and mutual control of oligarchy, bureaucracy and political personalistic regimes. As a result of this interactions two different solutions to the problem of civic nation building in a post-Soviet transformation context emerge. Which of these options may be more successful remains an open question.

TI ZHUKOVSKY AS A COEVAL OF THE PEDAGOGIC EPOCH IN GERMANY: GERMAN
   LITERATURE ABOUT UPBRINGING AND ARTISTIC PURSUITS OF THE POET IN
   1840S-1850S
SO IMAGOLOGIYA I KOMPARATIVISTIKA-IMAGOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES
LA Russian
DT Article
DE German literature about upbringing in 17th - 19th centuries; reformative
   pedagogic; pietism; Christian upbringing; personal library; V.A.
   Zhukovsky
AB This article covers the first attempt to reconstruct the pedagogic library of the 1840s - 1850s collected by V.A. Zhukovsky in Germany for upbringing his own children and the heirs of the Royal Family. On the basis of the notes, letters and plans left by the poet on the pages of the scripts the character of understanding the works about education is studied. The next evolutionary step of the creative thinking of late Zhukovsky correlates with the authentic German environment and the context of the last decade of his creative life. The resonant dialog of Zhukovsky with the pietistic direction of the pedagogic of Prussia is characterized in the article, the direct harmonies of the parts of works of German authors the poet chose and the motives of his late prose are discovered.
   Most of the editions about upbringing collected by the poet were published in Germany in the 1840s - 1850s in the German language (more than fifty books and brochures). The reading of these pedagogic works shows the high interest of Zhukovsky in the material, his own strategy of understanding and consistency of the views of the experienced tutor, his priorities.
   The pre-revolutionary historical-political situation and the reforms in the system of education carried out in the epoch of Friedrich Wilhelm IV defined the principles of the pedagogic edition selection. The foundation for the new governmental policy of Prussia in education and upbringing was the pedagogic doctrine of pietists. Over a half of the fifty books collected by Zhukovsky in the 1840s more or less coincided with the theoretical and practical aspects of the Christian upbringing. H. Langental's A Man and his Upbringing (Der Mensch und seine Erziehung. Jena, 1845), C. H. Zeller's The Lessons of Experience. For the Teachers of Christian Schools (Lehren der Erfahrung fur christliche Land- und Armen-Schullehrer. Stuttgart, 1846) and H.W. Grobe's The Value and the Methods of Christian Upbringing of Children (Werth und Weise der christlichen Kinderzucht. Ein Wort christlicher Liebe, allen Eltern, Lehrern und Erziehern. Kassel, 1851) attracted special attention of the poet.
   Almost every statement from the books that Zhukovsky highlighted finds correspondence in his late prosaic fragments. In the Russian poet's articles of the second part of the 1840s and of early 1850s, namely, in the essays 'The Liberty of Education', 'The Belief in Knowledge', 'What is Upbringing?' as well as in his letters, there are statements which almost literally renew the basic ideas of the moral and spiritual teaching of pietists about man and their upbringing.
   The prosaic series of articles, 'The Thoughts and Notes', by Zhukovsky in the 1840s and 1850s develops the keynote theme about the necessary union of the governmental power, public policy and the way of life of a single citizen in the light of Christian religion. The thesis statements of the Romanticist take place in the fragments of 'The Decision', 'Absolutism', 'Man in Society', in the biographic sketch 'Joseph von Radowitz' and in other works included in the planned but unpublished volume of his late prose. These reflections characterize the new step of universalism of the creative thinking of Zhukovsky; however, there are direct coincidences with his historiosophic concepts in the ideas of contemporary German journalism of the pietists-pedagogues.
   On the back cover of the book by Grobe there is a plan-signature by Zhukovsky which shows his great conception of a pedagogic publication designed for Russia. According to the plan, Zhukovsky collected the works of the most outstanding pietists-pedagogues of the German world in his library. All of them can be divided into several thematic groups. The first includes books of the followers and the disciples of Pestalozzi, prominent German and Switzerland pedagogues of the 19th century, who organized their own pedagogic provinces following the pattern of their teacher. The second group includes works about girls' upbringing and educating which was a topical issue for the German pedagogic science in the 18th century and an independent branch in the scientific and practical pedagogy in the 1840s. The third and the most numerous group was represented by collected anthologies for children reading, "old and new" as it was marked in Zhukovsky's plan, however, not published in the 1840s.

Analysis of the nature of the processes of reorganization of Russian society induces the author to call in question compliance of the conceptions of the reformativeness with many of the so called Russian reforms. The alternative approach - offered by the author - to the understanding of Russian socio-political life is its consideration through the prism of typologically and rhythmically reiterating formation/decomposition of the oprichnina-zemstvo model of the organization of power and of socium.

AB Building upon representative sociological data the idea of creative class as a subject of social action is discussed. The author concludes that creative class is interested in and is a proponent for alternatives to political radicalism as strategies of injecting and creating crises in contemporary Russian society. This class, as subject of social creativity, produces forms of social communication precluding conflict-ridden differences in Russian society. The article also discusses a need to involve creative class in the process of social changes to reduce political radicalization of mass moods.

AB The article examines various aspects of a "police state" - a historically unique phenomenon which originally appeared in German absolutist states of the XVIII century (Prussia being the first of such states). Such states were characterized by a developed discourse of state administration (cameralistics) coupled with intensive state interference into social and economic life of its citizens by means of police control. First, brief introduction into the problematics of a police state is given. We point out the inadequate contemporary reading of a "police state", exclusively viewed in the light of latter bourgeois law-based states of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The heuristic value of such social order analysis for general modern theory and particular theories of political power is also considered. The paper continues with a brief digression into the case history of the term "the police". The main semantic changes of the term are traced, beginning from its appearance in ancient Greece, and concluding with the absolutist epoch. The main part of the paper deals with the traditional police state as a historical phenomenon representing an attempt to implement an intentional utopia as an administrative practice and as a frame mercantilist concept of public good developed in cameralistics. Then, "police science" ("Polizeywissenschaft") of the eighteenth century is examined as the police state's own political discourse. The problematics of "police state" are applied to the Russian administrative experience in the conclusion.

Persistent lack of financing as the primary cause of the Russian higher education system inefficiency has resulted in emergence of incentives and informal institutions which impede efficient reforms.

ID ORGANIZATIONS
AB In this article, we consider journals as organizations from neo-institutional organizational theory (W. Powell, P. DiMaggio, J. Meyer, and B. Rowan). An editorial office as an organization has to solve the problem of legitimacy. In the case of the Soviet journal "Sotsiologicheskiye issledovaniya" ("SotsIs"), the only specifically sociological journal in the USSR, it was done by matching journal headings to the official ideology of Soviet sociology. Drawing on an analysis of the journal headings for the Soviet period (1974-1991), I argue that structural divisions of the journal space reflected legitimate meanings of the Soviet sociology as a discipline which was created for increasing the ideological and administrative efficiency of the Soviet government. Journal categories were a signal of loyalty, which was required for the organization's survival. During years of social and political changes, the role of the journal has changed. The journal has tried to attract general educated readers as well as visibly demonstrate this commitment to public issues by imitation of the evident features of 'thick' magazines and newspapers. In spite of all its changes, the journal has continued to depend on the meaning of sociology as a study of social problems. Externally given classifications have played a principal role in choosing an organizational form for searching and evaluating manuscripts. When the editorial office has clear tasks related to the content of the journal, the most appropriate form is the network form of governance because external reviewing makes it difficult to fill journal space. The organization has to use quasi-reviewing, which performs the function of bringing 'raw' manuscripts to contribute to the facade of the journal. The history of the Soviet "SotsIs" is a history of an organization, in which the content was tightly controlled, while control of the evaluation of manuscripts remained on the periphery.

TI Nationalism in a Russian Multicultural Region
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB ObjectiveThis article describes the functional mechanisms and evolution of ethnic nationalism in the Tyumen provincial Russian region at the turn of 21st century. The study focuses on analysis of changes in social policies and characteristics of ethno-political movements that claim to represent the Russian and Tatar ethnic groups.
   MethodsAnalytical instruments applied in this research are the concepts of constructivism and Bourdieu's genetic structuralism. The empirical base for this research includes political documents from regional public authorities, public organizations and public figures of the region, press materials, interviews with ethnic leaders, focus groups with representatives of youth organizations, observations made at public events, and photographic materials of graffiti in the cities of the Tyumen Region.
   Results and ConclusionsWe suggest that the main elements of these movements are, on the one hand, associations included in official public institutions that legitimize policy of public authorities and, on the other hand, a few associations seeking to meet the hierarchic social interests of the regional population from the standpoint of an ethnic division of society.

TI EUROSCEPTICISM: NEW FACTOR OF EUROPEAN POLITICS

LA Russian
DT Article
DE euroscepticism; European Union; euro-integration; European project;
   European political mainstream; Alternative for Germany; SYRIZA; National
   Front (France); United Kingdom Independence Party; Podemos
AB The phenomenon of euroscepticism, not long ago a marginal part of the European political landscape, increasingly moves forward to the political foreground. This article explores the meaning of the notion of euroscepticism, analyzes current peculiarities of this phenomenon, its scale and main sources, as well as differentiation of anti-integrationist political actors. While the very phenomenon existed in European politics throughout the implementation of the European project, a new characteristic of the socio-political situation in the EU is the ongoing broadening of this phenomenon's scale, the growth of its electoral support and the radicalization of its articulation forms. The strengthening of critical public attitudes towards realities of the European integration which is a feature of the contemporary sociopolitical climate in Europe not only has weakened the traditional pro-integrationist consensus of the political establishment, but has also led to a substantial reinforcement of more or less radical opponents of the European project within the European party-political space. This development seems to be an indicator of the European political mainstream "qualitative renewal". Though the current growth of electoral support for eurosceptic parties is to a great extent induced by the global financial and economic crisis, economic factor is not the main driving force of the euroscepticism. At present, a wide range of diverse political and cultural factors increasingly determine commitment of European citizens to the EU. In some cases, these factors are crucial to the development of euroscepticism. This fact is of significant importance, with regard to assessing the prospects for the given phenomenon, since political and sociocultural motives of public euroscepticism build much more sustainable basis for the eurosceptical trend than economic ones. Issues relating to the prospects of euroscepticism are of particular relevance, in connection with high performance of eurosceptic politicians at the 2014 European Parliament elections. The elections result is not only strengthening of the "soft eurosceptics'" positions, but also a sensational electoral "breakthrough" of "hard eurosceptics" (europhobes). While ability of eurosceptics' direct influence on the decision-making process in the EP seems insignificant, much more important is their capacity to influence the agenda of the mainstream pro-European parties both in Europe and at home. Ultimately, the rise of the euroscepticism makes the future of the European project more uncertain. Today (and probably, in the foreseeable future), the real purpose of European political elites may only be countering the trends of national sovereignty restoration, and maintenance of an integration process at its current level rather than its extension.

TI Ukrainian Nationalism during World War II: Its nature and manifestations
SO RUSIN
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Ukrainian nationalism; World War II; Organization of Ukrainian
   Nationalists (OUN); S. Bandera; A. Mel'nik
AB This article examines the nature and manifestations of Ukrainian nationalism during World War II. The authors dwell upon the making of the nationalist movement in emigration, and later across Ukraine.
   The authors come to the conclusion that, in its essence, Ukrainian nationalism was a social-political movement oriented towards the expression, protection, and actualization of the interests of the Ukrainian people. The creation of a Ukrainian nationalist state was seen as the primary means for resolving the above objectives. At the same time, the struggle for its creation began amid the unconcluded process of the formation of the Ukrainian nation. Worthy of note is also the relatively late emergence of political organizations pretending to the expression, as well as localization, of national interests mainly in Western Ukraine and, above all, in Halychyna, a region that had long been part of Poland and Austro-Hungary, which facilitated the entrenchment of anti-Russian sentiments in the latter.
   By the beginning of World War II, the influence of the Halychynans in the Ukrainian national movement had grown, while the national leaders who had stayed in the USSR were no longer active or were subjected to repressions. The leading positions in the Ukrainian nationalist movement came to be firmly occupied by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), although it was split into several factions within itself, which nevertheless shared the common sentiment of not just Ukrainophilia, but of Rusophobia and Anti-Sovietism, a sentiment largely exacerbated under the influence of a close partnership with the German Nazis. As a result, during the war the most widespread were the radical, more aggressive, manifestations of Ukrainian nationalism, which were accompanied by extreme forms of discrimination against representatives of other ethnicities, going as far as their physical extermination: the Russians, Jews, and Poles. Later on, hatred would be aimed at representatives of their "own" ethnicity deemed to oppose a specific faction within the OUN. Cruel terror attacks would be carried out against residents of Ukraine's both eastern and western regions - communists and Komsomol members, party officials and Soviet activists. By the same token, the OUN movement would be suppressed via mass repressions by homeland security agencies. The events of World War II and its aftermath resulted in serious trauma for many residents of Ukraine and may be viewed as having had an impact on the development of the present-day crisis in Ukraine.

DT Article
DE terrorism; theory of relative deprivation; social identification;
   terrorism of mass casualties; conflict of fundamentalist and European

AB In this work, the author discusses certain motivation aspects of the lower- and medium-level members of terrorist networks. It should be noted that the analysis of drivers for terrorist activity cannot be reduced to a single factor; in each case, a range of reasons, often interdependent and complementary, should be taken into account, as well as social, political and economic conditions "favorable" for the development of terrorism. Since the 1990s, and especially after 9/11, the studies of terrorism became more and more relevant. In this period, enormous research has been conducted regarding the logistics of a terrorist network, recruiting techniques and terrorist finance tracking. It has to be said that such research has greatly influenced the methods used today to fight terrorists in deep hiding. However, despite the ample analysis, scholars often miss one of the key elements of terrorism - the motivation of rank-and-file members of terrorist organizations that makes them give up their ambitions within the limits of universally accepted social behavior and seek to give way to their energy in the form of terrorism. Unlike the traditional criminal path which is chosen for lucrative reasons, participation in terrorist activities cannot be explained the same way.

AB This article uses a representative sample of elections held in 82 countries of the world (1993-2012) for a statistical analysis of factors that explain the number of parties in national legislative elections. The analysis confirms that the proliferation of candidates and/or parties at the district level contributes to the number of national parties, but the other crucial determinant is party system nationalisation. Several factors that are believed to have an impact on party system fragmentation, such as economic wealth, federalism, linguistic fractionalisation and population size, exert their influence on the number of national parties indirectly, by affecting either the number of district parties or party system nationalisation. At the same time, the significance of many other factors, especially those pertaining to electoral systems and the general political-institutional context, can be properly estimated only if the strongest determinants of system-level fragmentation are controlled for.

AB In 2015, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will expire and a new global development agenda will be adopted with a deadline of 2030. One key innovation will be the inclusion of peace, security, rule of law and good governance targets in the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, this very innovation has already proven to be a subject for lengthy and vigorous debates among the member states of the United Nations, and the prospects for a unanimous consensus over SDG 16 remain bleak. This article aims to unveil the substance of this debate not yet covered in Russian political science. The first section identifies the specificity of achieving the MDGs in fragile states and the key phases of work on integrating peace, security and governance in the global development agenda within Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. The second section summarizes the arguments of both proponents and opponents of SDG 16 and examines the key issues in monitoring and financing peacebuilding and statebuilding efforts after 2015. The conclusion assesses the justifiability of alarmism expressed by the emerging powers, including the Russian Federation, regarding SDG 16 and emphasizes that the prospects for progress in ensuring positive peace and human security, especially in fragile and conflict-affected states, will depend not only on the clarity of targets and indicators or on successfully mobilizing financial resources for these goals, but on the balance of power between developed and developing countries and on domestics politics within donor countries.

DE regional development; regional identity; regional development model;

AB The article specifies new factors that define capabilities and potential of Russian regions' development. Alteration of the state foreign policy, related to the turn to the East, may involve a high demand on natural resources and some technology innovations on the part of the Far East and the Baikal region. In this case sociocultural and political factors, as well as image components of the region that need to be improved, may become important factors. As a result, an identification matrix is being formed, compliance with which may turn the region into a self-sufficient economic entity. The author analyzes the potential and capabilities of the Republic of Buryatia which has all the chances for the economy growth and implementation of its competitive advantages. An authoritarian model of a political regime in the current situation is not an obstacle for a foreign-economic activity, as it lets minimize political conflicts; and a sociocultural identity and work on the regional image have good prospects. In general, the author justifies an actual task in the regional development of Russia - necessity of an accelerated development of the state's eastern regions.

AB In the humanities and social sciences, the politics of memory and related culture of remembrance increase their significance, affecting legislation, historiography, and political science. This article aims to present key approaches to studying the politics of memory and employ them to the analysis of the politics of memory on the territory of the former German province of East Prussia. The author shows different research perspectives on the key concepts of memory studies. Some researchers identify the notion of the 'politics of memory' with that of the 'politics of history', while others distinguish between them. The author evaluates the effects of using the category of 'memory sites'. Applying the method of historiographical analysis, the author examines similarities of and differences between approaches to the politics of history and the politics of memory. The author evaluates the effects of using the notions of 'memory sites' and 'memory conflicts' in the Baltic Region states, and reviews recent works of historians and political scientists on the changes in the culture of remembrance in Russia in general and the Kaliningrad region in particular during the Soviet and post-Soviet periods. Modern historiography is used as an example to demonstrate that 'memory sites' and the 'politics of history' are the most relevant concepts in the study of the culture of remembrance and identity, whereas a comparative analysis proves to be effective for the identification of the main features of the politics of memory on the territory of the former East Prussia.

TI THE ROLE OF NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS IN GOVERNING THE EUROPEAN UNION

LA Russian
DT Article
DE European Union; multilevel governance; democratic deficit; national
   parliaments; parliamentary democracy; Lisbon Treaty; subsidiarity
   principle
AB Institutional structures and decision-making processes, which have been established in the European Union, fall beyond the scope of national rules for the functioning of parliamentary government. National parliaments of the EU member states have not succeeded in acquiring solid positions in the multilevel constellation within the Union. Yet nowadays they are assigned an important mission in their efforts to overcome, alongside the European Parliament (EP), the growing democratic deficit at both the European and national levels. The article is meant to assess the potential of national parliaments in capitalizing on the Lisbon Treaty provisions and on new forms of their engagement with supranational institutions (the European Council, the European Commission and the EP in particular), aimed at enhancing their legitimizing influence. General paradigm for the analysis is determined by the multilevel governance concept (MLG). It allows for a picture of European decision-making, which is shared by actors placed at different levels of the governance structure. National parliaments are supposed to be provided with multiple access points to the political process in the European Union as well. But the MLG vision doesn't contradict the fact that the key role within the EU belongs to those who occupy the highest executive power positions at the national level.
   Three directions for the national parliaments to intensify their involvement are put into spotlight: parliamentary control over national executives; control of compliance with the subsidiarity principle in European legislative proposals and supranational decisions; political dialogue with the European Commission and interparliamentary cooperation. The analysis proves that conditions are ripe for more active stance of national parliaments in the EU affairs. The "system of early warning" of the subsidiarity principle violations, provided for in the Lisbon Treaty, seems most promising. But national parliaments themselves will still have to demonstrate more persistence when using new instruments.

AB The paper addresses the existing cross-regional diversity of delivery models in the sector of suburban passenger transportation in Russia by building a formal model of endogenous organisational choice. We develop a conceptual game-theoretic framework that allows for the trusting partnership to have become equilibrium in a regulatory bargaining game with delegation. The monopoly service provider initiates a more cooperative relationship with regional authorities by offering a share in the joint venture. The latter being benevolent welfare maximiser either accepts or rejects the offer taking into account transportation market characteristics, local budget constraints, information structure, as well as socio-economic and political factors. Once the partnership is formed the private information of the parties is revealed and information rent is eliminated creating the room for welfare improvement. However, ex ante rational organisational choice to form a trusting partnership may not lead to welfare improvement ex post. In the extended model we consider how concessionary passengers and fare-dodgers affect the bargaining outcomes. Our results can be generalized to characterize the diversity of organizational choices in the public sector. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this article is to formulate the principles for the future "collective biography" of the Poles in the academic corporation (lecturers) of St. Petersburg University from 1819 to 1917 (including the development of the selection criteria and methodology). The article examines the problems of the number of the Poles in the academic corporation, of the Polish identity and the criteria of its assessment, of the distribution of the Polish scholars across the University departments and fields of knowledge, and also the types of academic and life strategies of Polish lecturers. The article analyzes 3 strategies - the strategy of opposition, the strategy of loyalty and the strategy of integration. The author concludes that is possible to identify two groups of scholars of Polish origin, although the line between them is thin. The first group comprises those Poles who placed an emphasis or, at least, were conscious of their Polish identity. The scholars in the second group remembered about their Polish roots, but perceived themselves rather as Russian scholars (as a rule, they came from the families where several generations had lived in the Russian environment). The article shows that the revolutionary events of 1917 raised the issue of ethnic identity most acutely, the author supposes that a choice of "staying" in a new political environment in Russia for Polish scholars meant, among other things, a choice of assimilation; at least it was what it led to in reality.

AB The article analyzes the socio-political organization of the Pskov Veche republic in the 13th-151h centuries, particularly the changes in personnel and in competences of the Pskov princes, the authority and the officials of the princely administration. The article shows the evolution of the sotnia (a hundred unit) organization from the princely one into the republican one. The research reveals Pskov's considerable differences from Novgorod in terms of regulation of commerce and defines the function of the rank-and-file traders' elder in the system of the republican power. The author argues that the Pskov veche functioned as a state institution that had been formed in the course of Pskov's fight for independence in the 13th century. The fact of adopting the documents of taxpaying at the veche assembly reveals the fully institutionalized character of governmental bodies of the Pskov republic. By drawing upon H.J. Berman's argument of independence within European cities of the 11th-12th centuries, this article contributes to the discussion of Pskov's independence by outlining the main criteria of Pskov's sovereignty Pskov had a right to issue and supplement laws; the Pskov Judicial Charter arose out of the princes' local charters and was further edited at the veche assembly. Pskov set its own taxes and the veche was empowered to free separate groups of landowners from taxes. The rights to military mobilization, to the declaration of war and to making peace, which were under the complete jurisdiction of the republic, undoubtedly demonstrates the sovereignty of Pskov. Finally, the sovereignty of Pskov was manifested in the symbols of stamps and coins that were used in the Pskov republic. All these facts taken together demonstrate the feasibility of applying the medieval European cities' criteria of sovereignty to Pskov's socio-political realities.

   Khan; Jochi khan; Giray Khan; political history
AB The article reviews the manuscript book of Abdulgaffar Qirimi by the name of ''Umdet ul-Ahbar'' (''The Support of Communications''). This work is written in Ottoman language according to the tradition of Ottoman historical writings. Authors of the article briefly recount Abdulgaffar Qirimi's information contained in his work and dedicated to Genghis Khan, the Golden Horde, and the Crimean Khanate. Recently in Kazan have been published the facsimile and transcription of this work. Therefore, the authors decided to introduce into scholarly circulation the Russian summary of this work (the work being translated into Russian). Using a continuous method, the authors have made an overview of the main political events mentioned in the book. This information will be useful for the specialists studying the history of the Golden Horde and Tatar khanates. The importance of this source is beyond any doubt since Abdulgaffar Qirimi reports many original details and, especially for the 18th century, his information is authentic and based on personal observations. The manuscript book consists of several parts. It contains information about world history, the history of the prophets, the history of the Seljuks and Ottomans. The main part of the work is devoted to the Golden Horde (starting from Genghis Khan and his descendants), Crimean Khanate, Girayids and murzas. Abdulgaffar Qirimi sought to write a history of the descendants of Jochi khan. He used in his book more than 20 historical works. Abdulgaffar Qirimi reports the names of these works and indicates where he got this or that information. At the same time, he had access to the archives of the Crimean Khanate and used his family legends as well as popular traditions. Plenty of space in his work occupy his own observations as of a participant in military campaigns and court life. Although Abdulgaffar Qirimi makes some mistakes, however his work contains a complete history of the Golden Horde. His information concerning khans Berke, Tokhta, Uzbek, Tokhtamysh, and Ulugh Muhammad reflects the ''popular version'' and is based on oral historiology of the Tatars. Extensive information about the Crimean Khanate and the State structure of khanate are sufficiently original. In addition, a question of the spread of Islam among Tatars is considered in some detail and largely confirmed by other sources.

DT Article
DE corruption; lustration; post-Soviet states; qualitative and quantitative
   methods of political-science investigations
AB Considered in the article is the hypothesis according to which after the change of totalitarian and authoritarian regimes whose functioning was based on corruption, efficient countering the latter requires managerial lustration which promotes clearing of the organs of public authority from administrators of the former regime. This hypothesis is verified by analyzing the state of corruption in close connection with the realization of the processes of lustration in the 28 post-Soviet states of the Central and Eastern Europe, where fall of the Soviet regimes took place, and in the states that formed after the break-up of the USSR and of the SFRY. To verify the hypothesis, qualitative and quantitative methods of political-science research are applied. The results of the researches allow to conclude that managerial lustration after the change of the totalitarian and authoritarian regimes promotes the clearing of the organs of public authority from the bearers of corruptive relations and state management practices, and presents a favorable starting point for subsequently realizing a complex of institutional measures necessary to counteract corruption.

AB Social political crises and revolutions become more frequent in the new period of global turbulence. All revolutionary powers and regimes sooner or late meet the problem of legitimacy. The classical Weber's division of legitimacy is insufficient, and a new typology of legitimacy is suggested on the basis of evaluating agent (the popular legitimacy, the legitimacy of coercive force, the authoritative legitimacy, the international legitimacy) and on the legal basis (the legitimacy de facto and de jure, the last one includes formal legality and general legal legitimacy). The principles and criteria of revolutionary legitimacy are presented and discussed: relation to illegitimate repressive laws, conditions for the transition to armed resistance, the problem of provocations, conflict resolution between revolutionary center and a counterrevolutionary province ("Vandea"). It is shown how the fundamental legal principles and values of general significance (basic humanistic values) are used for legitimating of revolution in situation of formal legacy deficiency.

AB This paper deals with the various aspects of understanding of the nature of the First World War by prominent representatives of Russian liberalism. Authors analyzed their views on the nature of international conflict, the prevailing legal support European Law Enforcement, Russian foreign policy goals, the economic potential of the leading powers in wartime, the state and prospects of scientific knowledge, the political balance of power in the country. Russian liberals have stated that from the beginning of the First World War, Europe (and, consequently, Russia) ushered in the new era, existing on other, previously unknown laws. Previous norms of life - in politics, economics, law, and even science - had to undergo substantial revision. However, the Russian liberals themselves, defining their own tactics of political struggle in the near future followed the principles of the pre-war years. By modeling the shape of the world after the war, they were largely copied them habitual patterns of the recent past. The authors have carefully considered the most prominent Russian liberal attitude to the events of the First World War from its beginning to the revolutionary events of 1917, demonstrated a change in their relationship to the government and the internal arrangement of the country.

TI Value Characteristics of the Russian Political Process and Strategy of
   the Country's Development
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE political values; strategy of the power; political development;
   democratic transformation
AB The current phase of the political process which started in 2011-2012 opened a new page of the said development. This change calls for working out a new development strategy, impossible without clearing up value priorities of the power never analyzed during the whole post-Soviet period. One of the most important tasks while working out this value matrix would be taking account of those value priorities that have become established in society in the post-Soviet years. Figuring in the article are the data of the author's new investigation carried out from January to February and from March to August, 2013. Altogether about 2050 questionnaires have been collected. The investigation demonstrated that the break-up of the previous (Soviet) model and the transformation of Russia's society in the post-Soviet period mostly affected the spiritual, the moral and the psychological spheres. Previous value systems have been destroyed, whereas new democratic ones still find themselves within the stage of formation. Having left in the Soviet past societal monolithic disposition, Russia' society has come to plurality of political, religious, cultural values. Attempts to unify this heterogeneous society run against the pluralism values assimilated by the citizens. The presence of plurality of values promotes growth of the role of political parties; they could organically consolidate society in accordance with group interests. As for the aims and values of inward political development it should be quite definitely stated that democratic values have become firmly established in the Russian society. Repudiation of them would not be accepted by the majority of citizens. At the same time our society is tired of chaos, of lack of regulation within the power, and expects from the state more consistency in securing order and justice.

The different interpretations of the "fundamental" privatization theorem are discussed - through "principal-agent" approach, a comparison of the structure of information flows, the combination of property and contract rights, taking into account the socio-political factors, etc. The authors analyze recent policy trends of privatization in Russia for 2010-2013 in the context of the "reluctant privatization" and the asymmetry of the processes of nationalization and privatization.

AB The author analyses particularly important, topical and at the same time dramatically "tangled" national question in Russia. It is the politically determinative correlation of federal and national dispositions in its state system that constitutes the key object of the author's attention. Their combination, in the author's opinion, to a large extent predetermines specific character of the Russian federalism. The author considers the broad problematic field of mutual relations between the Russians and the non-Russian nations in Russia, as well as the variety of concrete connotation of "nationalism" in Russia's politics. He accentuates the threat of accumulation of misbalances in affairs of the state regulation of the federal and of the inter-national relations. The article covers also the idea of "new federalism" able to open the way for removal of irregularities in the relations between the Russian nation and the other nations of the Russian Federation.

DT Article
DE Spain; State of Autonomies; civic nationalism; regional nationalism;

   European Union; immigration and integration of migrants
AB The article addresses social and political conflicts with a clearly defined ethnic component in the modern Spanish society. Assessing the experience of regulating interethnic and interterritorial relations between Spanish nationalities and regions, the mass immigration of diverse cultural backgrounds in the asymmetric State of Autonomies, the author examines competitive identity politics and public discourses on nation, nationalism and nation-building. Voiced by the central and subnational authorities, it frequently assumes a conflict character. This is especially customary for Catalonia, but also applies to the Basque Country and several other autonomous regions. Education and language policies are a sphere of clashing perceptions and a key priority for politics of identity involving central and regional authorities, political parties and civil society groups. The increasing phenomenon of the ethnicity politicization in the State of Autonomies complicates the formation of the civic (national) identity and enhances the potential of ethnopolitical conflicts in the country, where particularistic sentiments are sufficiently strong in the historical perspective, while the mass foreign migration introduces new interethnic and intercultural contradictions and challenges. The Spanish experience of interethnic and interterritorial relations regulation and of positive civic identity construction in the context of the federalizing State of Autonomies may be useful for the Russian Federation having some similar problems on the agenda and a continuously developing model of federal structure.

DE soft power; world politics; measurements in international relations
AB Proposed by Joseph Nye, the concept of soft power as the ability of states (and other actors) to achieve their goals without resorting to threats, bribery or violence becomes an important component of international relations theory. However, even after more than two decades, the meaning and content of this concept are still not entirely unclear. It significantly complicates the task of soft power operationalization and its measuring, without which it is difficult to talk about turning this concept into a real instrument of international policy.
   The result of numerous discussions on this issue allows talking at least about two quite important criteria to typologize a possible ways of measuring the soft power. According to authors opinions, these ways of measuring can be: (a) an interpretation (specific content) of the measured phenomenon and (b) a type that is using to measure the initial data. Because the evaluation of soft power, as well as strength at all, may be related to various aspects of this concept, as such: firstly - the sources or resources - all that theoretically is capable of producing (to cause) the "soft power"; secondly - the tools and / or actions - is whereby an opportunities and resource potential is converted to the desired result; thirdly, the result - the effects that presumably caused by the available resources and taken actions.
   Differences in the purposes, extent of coverage, periods of time, methods of operationalization and measurement techniques are significantly restricts the ability of a systematic effectiveness comparison of these approaches to the measurement of soft power, according to the achieved results. The specific nature of soft power suggests that the best way to measure it is an international public opinion surveys. Thus, if the soft power is the ability to achieve the desired outcome by attracting and co-optation, it should be admitted that it is not at the disposal of the person who possesses it, but that person who is the objective of soft power's influence. Accordingly to the above, the value and effectiveness of soft power will be determined with the perceptions of the recipient countries audiences, which are finally decide what is attractive to them.
   This article discusses the currently existing basic approaches to the soft power's measurement. It suggests a possible way to differentiate these approaches with the general analysis of capabilities, strengths and limitations.

AB The article considers the problems of Spanish immigration within the period of 1981-2015, namely, its dynamics, latest tendencies and socio-economic characteristics (including changes in nationality, gender, age and educational structures of immigrants). Primarily, the stress is made on an in-depth analysis of the following main features of immigrants' population in Spain: the levels of their incomes, the unemployment rate, the living standards. The author makes a conclusion that Spanish immigrants constitute not only a majority of poor population in the country but they are also ones of the poorest in Europe. It is particularly evident against the background of their impact upon the economic activity and employment's rate of the country's population and economic growth. At the considered period all the mentioned indicators were noticeably higher for immigrants than for local labor force, not saying of the positive immigrants' influence on the growth and rejuvenation of Spanish people. Secondly, a considerable part in the article is devoted to the analysis of the immigration policy of Spanish government during the considered period of time. The author singles out the specific stages of this policy and shows that its contents and approaches modified in strict dependence of political factors. The Spanish Socialist Working Party was the beginner of the immigration policy in 1985 which always had the most liberal character particularly when it was concerned to the immigrant social and labor integration based on human rights equality. On the contrary, immigration policy of the now ruling conservative Partido Popular has more pragmatic, selective and rigid approach to foreign labor force legislation.

AB At the Boao Forum-2015 China fixed the main directions of its domestic and foreign policy. The major goal of its foreign policy is to actively influence the global economy development in the coming decades. The main impact directions are the following: restructuring of the world's infrastructure, changing of the global financial system, becoming one of the drivers in the global innovation economy. On a personal level, Xi Jinping continues to consistently implement its "strategic goal" - to go down in history as China's "number three leader" after Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. Xi is developing his major innovations: fight against corruption, establishment of the National Security Council, development of the "Chinese Dream" concept, formulation of the "New Norm" concept in the economy and of a new foreign policy doctrine. In the foreign policy, the course of improving China's global role and building a "new type" relationship with the United States is being strengthened. In relations with Russia and the United States, Beijing is following the dual-track policy of "hedging" political risks: on one hand, talking about a "special relationship with Russia", and on the other, - using the worsening of relations between Russia and the United States in order to receive dividends from both "Russia's turn to the East" and the U.S.' desire to prevent the rapprochement between Russia and China in a new version of the "Cold War". Prospects for a new balance of forces configuration in the West-China-Russia triangle over the next five to ten years do not appear favorable for Russia. China will continue the trend to global leadership and "partnership-rivalry" relationship with the United States.

TI COMMUNITY NAMES IN THE FIRST NOVGORODIAN CHRONICLE AND THE TERRITORIAL
   STRUCTURE OF THE NOVGORODIAN LAND (1115-1272)
SO STUDIA SLAVICA ET BALCANICA PETROPOLITANA
LA English
DT Editorial Material
DE Novgorod; Old Rus; the Middle Ages; community names; the Novgorodian
   Land; Finno-Ugric peoples; tribes; the First Chronicle of Novgorod;
   annals
AB There are only few written sources which present direct information on the territorial structure of early Rus, and in this situation the evidence of the Rus chronicles (annals) is of primary importance. In particular, it is interesting to study from this point of view the annalistic usage of community names - those of 'tribal' entities, dwellers of cities and towns ('the Kievans', 'the Novgorodians'), etc., those entities being often presented in the annals as actors. The paper is dedicated to an analysis of the usage of such community names inside the Novgorodian Land ('the Novgorodians', the dwellers of districts or Novgorod, the dwellers of towns subordinate to Novgorod, the Finnic-speaking 'tribes', 'all the Novgorodian Land') in the text of the First Novgorodian Chronicle for 1115-1272. The author follows the functions in which such communities can act: it is shown that in most of the cases the community names designate collective actors, and only rarely the meaning is 'some members of the community'. A community can act as an army, as a political body (which can, for example, invite or depose a prince), as a side in a conflict; it can be away from the city (as 'the Novgorodians' in 1211 and 1217, and 'the 'Pskovians' in 1213), etc. The following structure of the Novgorodian Land can be deduced from the analysis of the annalistic usage of the community names: the Land consists of Novgorod, the leading city (inside which, in turn there are 'sides', 'ends', and 'streets' which also can act in events), several subordinate towns (Pskov, Ladoga, Torzhok, Rusa, Luki, Volok Lamsky [?]) and three Finno-Ugric 'tribes' (the Vods,the Izhora, and the Korela). The status of the towns and the 'tribes' seems to be similar in many respects, as well as the character of references to them in the annals. Such uneven structure (towns and 'tribes') was characteristic not only for the Novgorodian Land: in the Chernigov Land there were the Vyatichi next to towns; similar is the position of the Golyad in the Smolensk Land. No rural community names are used in the Novgorodian annals, though a few times we meet geographical terms designating large areas. The question of administrative status of rural periphery of the Novgorodian Land must be answered on the base of other data: in the annals the Land is made up only of towns and 'tribes'.

AB The Scottish referendum occupies special place in the row of events determining the very essence of the current political transformations in the United Kingdom, and is bound to influence both the future of the British statehood and the long-term development of British political institutions. The referendum campaign and the results of the Scottish vote have further aggravated the imbalances between the "home nations" in the UK. The promises given by the British political class to Scottish voters will have long-time consequences for the ardently debated constitutional reform. Relations between the political institutions of the UK and Scotland are becoming a decisive driver of governance decentralization and regionalization as well as of the general trend towards federalism. The changes in the Scottish political landscape and the voters' behaviour can be regards as a message for other states with separatist risks. The politicization of Scottish identity, the affirmation of "home nations" identities and the growing importance of "the English question" for public opinion and political debates over the prospects of constitutional reform point to the changing nature of the nationalism in a society with strong civil institutions and a developed welfare state. "New" nationalism emerges as a hybrid phenomenon with political, economic and sociocultural connotations reflecting the expansion of the political sphere, and a strong civic identity - as source of social consolidation of a modern nation.

TI TRANSITOLOGY - SCIENTIFIC THEORY OR IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRUCT?
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE liberal democracy; democratic transition; "world democratic revolution";
   "post-Communist world"; "end of transitology"
AB The article argues that the idea of "democratic transition" during the 1990s served in the post-Communist as an intellectual compensation for the collapse of the ideals of socialism. It gave its advocates hope that societies that refused socialist ideas of the welfare state would get the chance to join its capitalist version when running the neoliberal recipes. In fact, it turned out that its practical sense was to ensure maximum transparency of the post-socialist economies and their integration into the global capitalist division of labor as a "supporting cast": on the one hand, as suppliers of cheap but skilled labour, raw materials and energy, and on the other as markets for Western goods and disposal area for hazardous waste. Thus, at the beginning of the new century it was increasingly noted that the concept of "transition", mobilized in the late 1980s - early 1990s for the analysis of world events and as a base of American policy of "world democratic revolution", was outdated and needed serious revision. The authors who hold this point of view sometimes justifiably criticize modern reality in most countries of the "third wave" as not corresponding even to the minimum criteria of liberal democracy. Today transitology as a subdiscipline studying the trends of diverse political transformations of the turn of the XX - XXI centuries no longer aims at constructing a universal model of democratization. Transition is understood as "a project with an open ending", involving a multiplicity of ways - as of transition and its results. Therefore, the "end of transition paradigm" is not identical to the "end of transitology".

AB This paper deals with the personality of Hambo Lama Ayusheev-head of the Buddhist Traditional Sangha of Russia. The author argues that his influence over the public sphere goes far beyond the limits of religion: it reflects and defines the state of Buryat public thought. He shows all-round devotion and loyalty to the Russian authorities, thus receiving support and appreciation from them. He tries his best to maintain Buryat ethnicity through revival of traditional economy and culture and simultaneously he emphasises the sub-ethnic prejudices; thus the authority of Hambo Lama legitimises and strengthens opposition between clan and territorial groups that are anyway tense enough.

The paper gives contemporary analysis of the above-mentioned conceptions with the aim to reveal common features in these models of scientific dynamics and to define the most important parameters for transformation and development strategy of the contemporary science. The reason of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary integration are displayed: Transdisciplinarity entered the scientific practice and became particularly acute in terms of technoscience and convergent technologies. It is highlighted that regarding new forms of scientific knowledge with integrated fundamental, applied, socio-psychological, sociocultural, ethical and political aspects we should not forget about incorporation of science and society into overwhelming evolution process with interpretation of interaction between science and society as co-evolution..

TI DISCOURSES OF EMPIRE AND NATION IN EARLY TWENTIETH-CENTURY BESSARABIA:
   Russian-Romanian Symb olic Compe tition and the 1912 Anniversary
SO AB IMPERIO-STUDIES OF NEW IMPERIAL HISTORY AND NATIONALISM IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE
LA English
DT Article
AB This article discusses the celebration of the centenary of Bessarabia's annexation to the Russian Empire in May 1912 and its significance for the conflicting rival Russian and Romanian discourses over this region in the early twentieth century. The authors argue that this event marked a defining moment in the consolidation of Bessarabia's status as a contested borderland and had a powerful influence on the mutual Russian and Romanian claims to the province's "symbolic inclusion." On the one hand, it represented the high point of the attempts of the imperial authorities and the Russian public sphere to construct a coherent image of the province and to forge a representation of Bessarabia as an organic part of the imperial polity. On the other hand, it stimulated a "symbolic competition" between the Russian and Romanian visions of Bessarabia and its population, adding further complexity to Russian-Romanian relations both in the political and symbolic spheres. The Bessarabian case is an excellent illustration of the shifting patterns of identity politics and political mobilization in the late Russian Empire. The 1912 anniversary led to a "hardening" of the imperial discourse while also emphasizing its uneasy cohabitation with the "nationalizing motives" and its internal contradictions. The 1912 ceremonies performed in the Russian Empire also had consequences for the Romanian national narrative, including the firm placing of Bessarabia on the map of the Romanian intellectual community and the increased presence of Bessarabian topics in the political debates of the day. The peripheral Bessarabian context acted as a mirror for the dilemmas of state-building and identity construction in both cases. On the Russian side, the older concepts of dynastic loyalty and Orthodox unity had to adapt to the nationalizing vocabulary of ethnicity and "populist" rhetoric; on the Romanian side, the broadly shared national consensus was questioned in terms of priorities and ultimate goals. These processes intersected in May 1912, when the Russian and Romanian "scenarios of belonging" were enacted on the occasion of the festive ceremonies in Bessarabia and the opposing "rituals of commemoration" in the Romanian Kingdom.

TI Russia and the World: 2016 IMEMO Forecast
SO NEW PERSPECTIVES
LA English
DT Article
AB This forecast examines the major trends in Russia's relations with the world and in the Russian view of the world in 2016. The forecast looks firstly at Russia's role in the world in the context of the extant and emergent state of geopolitics. In a confused international environment, caught between the multiple, discordant and disorderly games of checkers of the present and the emerging design of a new grand chessboard for international relations, Russia and the West have been forced into cooperation. While far from easy and far from guaranteed to work - or last - this situation does offer the possibility of overcoming divides to pursue mutual interests. These interests become particularly apparent in the context of increased shared threats and the need to act jointly against them, the uncertainties created by rising powers, and the difficulties that Russia finds itself in. The key role of new mega-regional trade agreements in this emerging great game is also emphasised in the subsequent sections of the forecast, which deal, respectively, with foreign policy and political economy. The foreign policy analysis sees the US in flux in a presidential election year, and the EU caught at the crossroads of its own failure to capitalise on integration and a migration crisis of unprecedented proportions. Meanwhile, foreign policy in the post-Soviet space is characterised more by stasis than by substantial change, with frozen conflicts and stagnant reforms in Ukraine and limited room for manoeuvre for other players the order of the day. The Russian involvement in the Middle East, however, is anything but stagnant, with the military operations in Syria having dramatic effects in both the situation in Syria and global and regional geopolitics. The sustainability of this quest for influence, however, is questioned by the attitude of other players, but also by Russia's own internal weaknesses, notably its serious and deepening economic crisis.

TI DISTINCTIONS OF POLITICAL CULTURES AND THE INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russia; the West; modernization; Ukraine; the USA; Europe; values;
   modernity
AB The dramatic events in Ukraine frustrate the world order that seemed to have just been established and do not offer any conceptual evaluations of it. The crisis is mostly considered to be of purely political nature and is discussed far less thoroughly than, for example, the Cold War used to be analysed. This article offers a review of the positions of certain American researchers who only partly share the Washington's point of view on the Ukranian crisis or disagree with it completely, though all fear the imminent changes. The study of their positions brings us to the understanding of concrete distinctions of the Russian and Western political cultures. All in all, Russia's geopolitical position, clearly underpinned by the determination to protect the country's national interests, clashes with the Western concept of democratic transformations, which, in turn, covers a desire for expanding the sphere of Western influence. The author attempts to demonstrate that the decisive concepts in interpreting the "West vs non-West" conflict are those implying conservation, in the West, of the idea of nonWestern countries' modernization catching up with the West. This vision is not adequate to the reality of many non-Western countries, and first of all of Russia and China, being deeply involved in national modernization models borrowing the experience both of the West and of the non-West on the basis of the use of their own culture as resource of development. From this point of view, democracy does not present itself as a ready-made project, but is built by each country with due regard for possibility of its adoption by the masses. The problem is thus raised of the Russian traditional values being an annoying obstacle for the West. It is demonstrated that such values are inherent in the West likewise, and their renunciation would have led to anomy in the period of transition to the modern. Analyzing contemporary Western political and, still more attentively, political-science discourse, the author distinguishes in it - and criticizes - a visible trend of reducing the concept of Europe to the bounds of the EU. To sum it up, both political cultures - the Russian and the Western - contain common elements, but differing dominants. Their serious and reciprocal discussion may produce upheavals capable of preserving from irrevocable changes.

ID SEGMENT DISCLOSURES
AB The aim of this study is to examine the place of the Baltic States on the corporate world map, a contemporary, foreign-investment-driven alternative to the more familiar political map. To this end, the author studies the geographical place of the Baltics in the documentation of transnational corporations. The research database consists of financial reports and presentations of 60 leading European (including Russian) transnational corporations. Special attention is paid to companies from countries with significant FDI stock in the Baltic States. This study is a first step towards analyzing international investors' interpretation of the new European borders. The connection between the neighborhood effect on FDI distribution and geographical segmentation in the corporate paperwork is established. Some companies use a multilevel division (e.g. Europe/Eastern Europe), where the Baltics is usually associated with "Europe" (with or without Russia and Turkey). However, in some cases the Baltic States are clustered under "home market" (as is the case with some Swedish companies), "former Soviet Union" (some Russian companies), "Northern Europe and Central Asia," and even "Middle East and Eastern Europe." Varying understanding of where exactly the borders of Europe lie could explain the plurality of attitudes of the European business establishment to the EU sanctions against Russia.

AB The article analyzes the studies of contemporary Russian historians (Y. Z. Kantor, S. T. Minakov, B. V. Sokolov, N. I. Shilo and A. V. Glushko) on various aspects of the biography of Marshall M. N. Tukhachevsky. The analyze of this personality is can help to understand political choice of officers of the 'old' Russian army during the revolution, the assessment of the role of the military leaders of the Civil War, a military construction and development issues of military theory in 20-30th., the struggle for power in the leadership of the USSR, the repression of 1930s and also the problem of defeat of the Red Army in the initial period of World War II. It is necessary to find a strict distinction between the different aspects of the activity of military leaders - their military leadership, military-administrative, military-theoretical and political activity. The author points to the large number of myths and statements, which are prevailing in historiography, but did not favor by the facts. It reveals a number of problems of contemporary Russian historiography, for example, the extreme diversity of opinions, leading to the coexistence of the concepts that have been generated in different eras and stages of development of historical science, the weak links between historians, unwillingness to get into argument, following prejudiced attitudes. The author makes a conclusion about necessity of study the organizational structure of headquarters and troops in comparison with the similar structures of the other countries' armed forces, daily management of troops and material certifications, as well as the study of the first operations plans, which were developed by the Soviet military leadership in 1920-1930s in the context of military construction and military planning of the potential enemies of the USSR.

AB Substantiated in the article is the thesis of the quantitative and qualitative expansion of the "liberal inclination" in the party-political field of Western democracies. This expansion is based, on one hand, on the development of liberalism as such; on the other hand, on the adoption of the liberal creed by social democratic and conservative organizations. Under these circumstances, the process of "humanization" of liberalism is gaining momentum, while at the same time liberalism is shifting to the individual-group, "solidarity" dimension. A quickly developing synthesis of party and group principles results in the hybridization" of liberalism, which substantially increases its social and political weight and significance. Opposed to the "solidarity" trend, a rapid intensification of ultra-conservative anarcho-individualism is taking place. Both these extremes, as well as the political space between them, represent fundamentally different trends in mass perceptions, and their study of becomes increasingly important both for politics and for political science. In the struggle against the ultra-right fundamentalism the impact of different kinds of organizations and communities is increasing; the leading role among these is played by the international liberal think tank "Policy Network".

AB The article presents the main results of the first phase of the study launched in 2015 by ISEDT RAS researchers and aimed at assessing subjective satisfaction with the quality of life and its impact on social development. The article shows that subjective assessment of quality of life is a criterion for assessing the efficiency of public administration, an indicator of people's attitude toward economic, social and political decisions. The generalization of domestic and international experience serves as the basis proving that in the post-industrial economy the phenomenon of happiness is important as a goal of public administration and criterion for evaluating its effectiveness from the viewpoint of politicians, economists, sociologists and psychologists. The authors consider the main international and national indicators and ratings of happiness that help to carry out cross-country comparisons, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages of index methodologies for assessing the level of happiness are as follows: the use of national averages without taking into account the uneven distribution of benefits and driving forces of spiritual and moral development of individuals; lack of opportunity to make prompt and regular calculations of the indices and to take into account the specifics of countries, cultural and ethnic differences. The integral indicator does not even reflect problems highlighted by partial indices. The article also substantiates the necessity of using self-representative questionnaire methods as the most reliable sources of information about the level of people's subjective satisfaction with the quality of life, and highlights several methodological features of their application. The authors provide research findings by VTsIOM, RAS Institute of Sociology, and ISEDT RAS, which not only assess the level of happiness, but also identify a set of conditions affecting its formation: financial well-being, family relationships, satisfaction with one's profession.

AB South Africa joined BRIC group of Brazil, Russian, India and China in 2011, two years after it was established, thus creating the BRICS. This was consonant with the main principles of South Africa's foreign policy under its first democratic government. It regarded the association as a group of like-minded independent countries to be a political and moral force for changing the world. By admitting a leading African country to the group, the original BRIC members sought to eliminate the geographical divide and include the country that enjoys a high moral authority and plays important role in peacekeeping and mediating conflicts. Through its membership in the BRICS, South Africa wanted to achieve aims at various levels: addressing poverty, inequality and job creation at home; gaining synergic support from BRICS partners for Africa; and increasing support for reforming the international financial institutions and the United Nations. This article analyzes to what extent those plans have been realized during the four years of South Africa's membership in the BRICS and comes to the conclusion that South Africa is the last but not least member.

   service; patronage networks; seller's market; buyer's market; demand and
   supply of corruption
AB Authors develop a new conceptual approach to the corruption studies and effectiveness of anti-corruption regulations of public service. Basing our hypothesis on the study of effective models of conflict of interest regulation, authors assume that there is a "missing factor" in the modern corruption studies. This "missing factor" is a "corruption market", particularly, its size, type and nature. Conflict of interest regulations' aim at controlling key channels of corruption behavior, and corruption market in its turn determines prevailing channels of existing corruption behavior. Thus, misidentification of corruption market's type is the main reason for the failure of anti-corruption policies, no matter how new and effective models are imported. Corruption market's size is defined as the number and average price of corruption deals. The nature of corruption market depends on the side, setting the final price of corruption deal. Resulting from institutional characteristics of public administration, corruption markets are either seller's or buyer's type. Seller's corruption markets are sensible to the ethic regulations of the public service, and the only effective way of tackling buyer's corruption markets are "cut-red-tape" reforms and compliance-based regulation of conflict of interest. Type of corruption market encompasses 3 dimensions: quality of institutions, scope of regulations and degree of regulations. Basing on the introduced model, authors identify and analyze 8 types of existing corruption markets. Each type of corruption market has its own transformational dynamics and, consequently, own opportunities for anti-corruption policies. A new conceptual model of corruption market evolution is introduced in the article. Transformations of corruption markets depend on several factors. The key factors are personalization of political regime, "new public management" reforms of public administration, populist policies and creation of rentier states, and set up of the Welfare State.

DE services sector; management; government policy
AB At present, many services companies are joining the ranks of science-intensive national economy sectors, generating various innovations, among them innovations in the spheres of infrastructural, utility, household services, as well as computer, engineering, telecommunications, medical and educational technologies and services. All of the above contributes to the dynamic development of the services sector.
   In the services sector, a major role is played by the provision of household services to the population. However, the network of household services companies is insufficiently developed in rural areas, especially in highly peripheral towns and villages, which presents a serious setback in the development of the household services industry.
   An important role in the functioning and development of the services sector locally is to be played by municipal administrations since faster progress in the local services sector will act as a catalyst for local development capable of triggering a chain of stable intrinsic changes in the economy of a municipality. However, by far not all local administrative bodies pay due respect to the above.
   This work is aimed at researching how government policy, including regional and municipal policy, influences the development of the services sector.

DE political reality; language in political function; political discourse;
   Orwell's linguistic theory; Newspeak; doublethink; multiple reference;
   possible world semantics
AB The domain of reference of political discourse is not autonomous from language; this domain is a construct generated by the discourse itself. Such an approach to the relation between language and political reality was expressed in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Concepts of modern semantics and pragmatics allow to explicate how language acts as both a form of constructing reality and a special type of social verbal behaviour. Language has become exclusively modal and intentional; any utterance expresses the relations of obligation, possibility, etc. and may be interpreted in intensional and, hence, in referentially non-opaque contexts. However, the semantics does not lose its referential force. In contrast, this force is multiplied, becoming a transworld relation. In this respect, the semantics of political discourse is akin to poetic semantics; however, the multidimensionality of the signified referents is hidden because referential discourse is a precondition for effectiveness. Political discourse, as a description of "world as it is", presupposes a hidden reference to other modal contexts "world in the future" (or "in the past"); "how the world should be" (or "should not be"), etc. The domain of the interpretation of political discourse is a set of possible worlds.

DE Yablo's paradox; Liar paradox; self-reference; double-referential
   cycles; segment of reference; cluster of reference
AB The article studies Yablo's paradox, and discusses a number of issues related to paradoxical nature of finite and infinite sequence of Liar-like sentences. In particular, here was raised and analyzed two closely related to each other problems: the possibility of constructing a finite version of this paradox and issue about the presence or absence of self-reference signs in original infinite version of the paradox which was proposed by Stephen Yablo. Finite version of Yablo's paradox is constructed with using so-called double-referential cycles for a groups of three sentences Sn, Sn+ 1, Sn+ 2. Such a group of sentences is an elementary part of any version of Yablo-like paradox (including finite and infinite versions). Formed by these groups of sentences the minimal segment of reference has no signs of self-reference, but created on the basis of these groups of sentences a finite cluster of reference, which presents the finite version of Yablo's paradox, contains a circular structure and some self-reference links. Thus, the paradoxical nature of any Yablo-like sequences of sentences (both finite and infinite) is closely related to a kind of referential excess, which occurs due to the presence double-referential cycles into such sequences of sentences. Analysis of the finite version of Yablo's paradox allows to make analogous conclusion about the presence of self-referential signs in original infinite version of the paradox which was proposed by Stephen Yablo. This conclusion forces us to recognize accuracy of widespread and fairly stable logical-linguistic belief, according to which the origin of any problems with the paradoxical for different sets of sentences is the use of semantically closed language, or to recognize the need to expand our understanding of the self-referential phenomenon and to consider any language, which doesn't inform us about anything beyond his borders, as a self-referential language.

DT Article
AB This article presents personal accounts by Russian sinologists about their professional work abroad and exchanges with foreign colleagues during the Soviet period (1917-1991). Divided, isolated, oppressed, discriminated, limited, and confined to their country for many decades, Russian sinologists still managed to maintain contacts with their colleagues in China, the "socialist camp," and the global sinology community. Sinologists in the USSR had to implement various methods to penetrate the political and ideological "Iron Veil," to promote their studies abroad, and to participate in international cooperation on China studies. This study utilizes data obtained from nearly 40 interviews conducted in Russia as part of "The Epistemology of China Studies: Oral History Project" from 2009 to 2014. Its purpose is to demonstrate the uniqueness of professional interviews as a potentially rich source and foundation for further academic explorations of oral history on China studies.

DE symbolic approach to study of politics; political symbolism of
   parliament; theories of representation
AB The article deals with perception of the representative function of the parliament by elite and mass society thus demonstrating possibilities of the symbolic approach to study of perception of parliamentarism in post-Soviet Russia. It starts with discussion of particular features of symbolic approach to study of politics. Basing at observations made in the collective project of human capital of the Russian political elites it analyses meanings ascribed to representation by the members of elite and mass groups. It takes as an instrument of analyses the normative models of representation developed at different stages of parliamentarism in Europe and the US. The author comes to the conclusion that the notion of the nature of parliamentarism articulated in the discourse of the deputes of the State Duma is most close to the elitist model of trustee. The representatives not only speak by the name of the people because they understand its needs, but also pretend to teach it about its true interests. They tend to represent a concern for people's welfare as their key professional duty which could be interpreted as an element of the model of delegate - even if only in rhetoric. At the same time in spite of the efforts aimed at strengthening of party representation the model of the party mandate is very rare in the discourse of the Russian parliamentary politicians. It could be explained by the fact that the system of political decision-making is dominated by the executive power that is not formed by the principle of party representation. So, the symbolism of parliament articulated in the discourse of the deputes of the State Duma is close to the model of trustee. However, analysis of surveys of VTSIOM and Levada-center demonstrates that mass perceptions of the Russian parliament do not correspond to high moral standards of people's representatives supposed by this model. So, there is a clear dissonance between perceived and articulated symbolism of the parliament. At the same time the protest movement of 2011-2012 gives an evidence that at least some part of the Russian society demonstrates a demand for the other meanings of political representation.

DE money; capitalistic spirit; money myth; money dialectics
AB In this work the essence of money conception ambivalence is revealed. On the one hand, money universality and its transforming power, its power over people, the ability to define moral principles and also the tendencies of democratization point to money analogy with the divine power. On the other hand, in human history, myths and traditional conceptions, money associated with something devilish and dirty, with appearing of the evil spirit very often.The connection of money with divine we can find in the following points.
   - The Polanyis' investigation has shown that money appearance did not mean its usage as a universal exchange process. In particular, money usage as a source of payment was not connected with economical bargains. Firstly, any payment was like a punishment of guilt, it was stated by Gods and by their vicars on the Earth. It was impossible to buy goods for this money but it was possible to get expiation.
   - Money universality in modern society allows speaking about the importance of utilitarian ethics where money takes the moral God's power.
   - Money thanks to its ability to calculate everything and, on ground that, to compare establishes has its own world order.
   - Gold as one of the most ancient money equivalents is also one of the most ancient God's symbols.
   There is an opposite view. One of the main reasons of mythological conceptions about money is that there is a motive which sounds like "Money belongs to the evil spirit". For example, according to the ancient Babylonians' view point money is hellish eruption. In Russian peasant culture there is a superstition that money is brought by devil or snakes. In modern Russian society the associative relation of money with something dark and dirty is rather spread and well-established. The mentioned ambivalence can be continued with the following factors. Firstly, money universality, their power over people causes a clash between their uselessness as a subject taken beyond exchange function. This contrast is between the most important and, as a matter of fact, uselessness. Money performs the abstract usage, but itself it is "dead". Secondly, money property itself is to destroy the conception of interpersonal relationships, to introduce calculation principles that form the reaction of hatred and contempt expressed in conception about devilish essence of money.

DE globalization; technological development; innovations; social policy
AB In the article we proposed the definition of the vector of human potential development which connects social orientation of economics, processes of post-industrialization and of globalization. Social orientation represents the main goal of socio-economic development, a way of its achieving is represented by post-industrialization and globalization is a criterion of more effective use of resources.
   The realization of principles of socially oriented economics promotes a progress of society and of an individual in theoretical and methodological context in terms of globalization and post-industrialization. Achieving these targets requires the realization of corresponding socio-economic state policy in practice. The development of human potential, preservation of national and cultural identity and providing state social guaranties should become the basis of this policy.
   Postindustrial challenges and demographical problems have caused the crisis of traditional "state of common welfare" and set a task of forming the postindustrial state. Key priority of this model is a modernization of social state, its transformation in conformity with the principles corresponding to challenges of post-industrial society and requiring on the one hand the deciding of social, fiscal and investment tasks and the achieving of global competitiveness on the other hand.

ID SELF-INTEREST
AB In existing theories of human behavior the concept of self-interest is of immense significance. Debates over the self-interest in the economic theory have grown in scale as models of individual economic behavior within the rational choice theory and economic theory of welfare gained currency. The aim of the study is to explore modern concepts of self-interest and reveal trends in development of the self-interest theory as based on identification of preconditions, factors and criteria of rational behavior in hired personnel within an organization which is driven by the self-interest. The methods of analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, analogy were employed in the study. Findings of the study: boundedly rational nature of the self-interest was revealed in the organization personnel; prescriptive nature of personal interest impact on behavior was revealed in the organization personnel; methodological aspects of self-interest identification in hired personnel were implemented based on analysis of their conscious rational behavior within the organization; practical prerequisites for economic behavior in personnel were identified.

DT Article
DE microphysics of power; sovereignty; police state; governmentality;
   discipline; absolutism
AB The article offers an extended analysis of a research program outlined by Michel Foucault in his lectures at the College de France during the close of the 1970s. This program was focused on the society that was influenced by the practices of the absolutist state within the framework of a specific "governmentality" discourse. The introduction puts forward the basic problem of insufficient interest displayed by sociology towards particular historical forms in which the state monopoly on violence was realized. The first part of the article considers the "immanent" theory of power introduced by Foucault. The core of this theory relies on his thesis that relations between domination and subjugation pervade the entire social fabric, and results in the microphysical dimension of power coming out on top in social and political analysis. The central part of the article proposes a reconstruction of Michel Foucault's views on such discursive phenomena of Modernity as the police, the science of policing and the police state (Polizeistaat). The article concludes with the declaration of the huge heuristic potential of concepts elaborated by Foucault in his analysis of power techniques in early Modern times for the general theory of Modernity and for the historical and sociological reconstruction of Russian imperial modernization in 18th to the 20th centuries as well, including the efforts taken by Peter I and Catherine the Great to use the police as a tool to govern Russia's lagging westernization.

AB The article analyzes Germany's soft power. According to the German government's report on cultural foreign policy in 2010-2011, educational and cultural foreign policy are supporting elements its foreign policy. This position characterizes the agenda of many soft power actors.
   Germany has developed a unique system of soft power. Non-governmental organizations including political foundations prevail among its main actors. Their major sources of funds are federal and regional budgets, their own income, membership fees and donations. Their activities focus on education, science, culture, economic relations and international development. Soft power actors prioritize the German language and culture, promoting democracy, developing scientific and economic relations, and positioning German goods, services and educational facilities.
   The author emphasizes the variety and integrity of German soft power, which is well coordinated and open. Germany's soft power often receives high evaluations in international rankings and research reports. The author reviews the main soft power agents activities in 10 countries: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. Among these countries, Brazil is a top target of Germany's soft power, which multifaceted, sophisticated and well developed. Germany also pays attention to cooperation with Ukraine, Vietnam and Kazakhstan. Mongolia, Armenia and Azerbaijan receive less attention, and there are few German programs and soft power tools. However, more broadly, Germany has increased its interest towards the countries analyzed.

LA English
DT Article
DE ulus of Jochi; kurultai; Mongol Empire; international relations;
   geopolitics; Genghisids; Jochids; Batu khan; Golden Horde
AB The article examines the Genghisid kurultai held in 1235. The author notes that in many aspects the kurultai of 1235 not only differed from other similar kurultais, but did not quite fit into the political reality of the early imperial period. The author examines in some detail the purpose of the new Western campaign of the Tatar-Mongols. Despite the fact that the Western campaign had a panMongolian character, it contributed to a significant enhancement precisely of the Jochids pushed off earlier into the background by other Genghisids. Batu Khan, the new ruler of the Jochid ulus, succeeded both in extending the ulus of Jochi and resuscitating the ulus of his father. But most importantly, he won the right to lead the army of the whole empire, which immediately changed his status and the status of the Jochids. In a fairly short time, the Jochids had been strengthened to such an extent that they were able to take revenge from their cousins. After had defeated the descendants of Ogedei and brought to power the Toluids, the Jochids willingly relinquish power in the "indigenous yurt", since they already possessed vast territories and established a functioning state system. They used their influence in the capital only to strengthen their own ulus. The Jochids tried to keep the Mongol Empire under their control by ensuring decision-making at the next kurultais in accordance with their political interests.
   The author believes that there were active negotiations among the Genghisids before the kurultay of 1235. The fact that the Western campaign was headed by Batu and not by the sons of Ogedei, represented an unconditional victory of the Jochid "family" diplomacy, since previously the Jochids were not allowed to the leadership of the Mongol campaigns. Thanks to the Western campaign, the Jochids were able to expand their possessions to such an extent that, immediately after the campaign, their relationship with the central government and other Genghisids acquired quite a different character.

DT Article
DE a healthy lifestyle; public health policy; social constructionism;
   healthism
AB The article provides a sociological interpretation of how the modern Russian state pursues the promotion of a healthy lifestyle. This process is analyzed through the theoretical framework of social constructionism; the term "healthism" is employed here in order to problematize the government's activity in the development of a "proper" attitude towards health. The authors adopt a broad understanding in conceptualizing a "healthy lifestyle"; this includes both the behavioral characteristics and the specific living conditions of the individual, as well as a more narrow focus on the choice of a particular behavioral model by the individual. An analysis of publications in Russian Internet media and state-owned newspapers was conducted in order to highlight the main forms of healthy lifestyle promotion currently carried out by the Russian state. These include: legislation prioritizing the promotion of a healthy lifestyle; the personal involvement of Russian political leaders in sport and physical activity; the implementation of health promotion campaigns as a part of global sport events such as the Winter Olympics or the World Cup; and representatives of the government presenting themselves in the mass media as "health experts". The authors conclude that, while the promotion of a healthy lifestyle is growing rapidly in the Russian Public Health system, there remains a narrow understanding of what the term ''healthy lifestyle'' actually means. This limited understanding dominates political decisions in Russia today. Public health policy requires a more complex understanding of ''lifestyle''; one including not only behavior aspects but also focusing on social and economic conditions.

DT Article
DE Political violence; Russian revolution of 1917; Petrograd garrison;
   Bolsheviks
AB This article analyzes a unique phenomenon in the struggle for power in 1917 - the destruction of posters and banners by the soldiers of the Petrograd garrison. Demonstrations featuring political slogans were a very popular political activity and sometimes the cause of big conflicts between different social groups. Most often destroyed were posters of a patriotic nature. In this case, the influence of left-wing parties was minimal, sufficing only to create a tense atmosphere in which open conflicts could erupt. Direct appeals of the Bolshevik party and its allies to participate in such actions have not been uncovered. The author examines some of the most important cases where enemy posters served at the target of such aggression. This approach allows for some distance from the social conflicts in the society of that period and casts light chiefly on the political component of these activities. On the basis of archival and press sources, the author argues that a special grassroots political culture formed within which violence became a natural part of the struggle for power. At the heart of this peasant soldier behavior was a special understanding of the freedom of speech and rules of political struggle. In this way it is becomes clear how they understood the revolution and the "new regime.".

TI UKRAINE IN THE POLITICAL CRISIS: THE IMAGE OF RUSSIA AS CATALYST OF
   CONTRADICTIONS
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Ukraine; Russia; political discourse; mass media; school textbooks;
   national identity; national interests
AB This paper deals with the period that is prior to Ukraine's crises of 2013-14. The image of Russia shaped by political discourses, TV news and school textbook on history and geography is analyzed. The authors examine in what way the political doctrines which were in use exerted influence upon public opinion and resulted in direct and indirect consequences. They argue that the "European prospect", which is serving as a guide line for social and institutional modernization all around Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia, has been transformed in Ukraine into an ideology for identity and state-building. The European aspiration was legitimized by an idea that "Ukraine is not Russia". This concept kept its importance during the Post-Soviet period regardless of changes in political elites and has been transmitted through the mass-media and school education. The politics of the Ukrainian media was one-sided in spite of declared pluralism of opinions and freedom of speech. The TV news has not reflected the current events so much as a "war of discourses" promoted by protagonists and antagonists of the Ukrainian government. The observed plurality of Ukrainian media did not become a plurality of meanings and approaches. Analyses of the political discourses and mass media are balanced by review of school textbooks on history and geography. The authors discovered that all of the textbooks assumed a similar initial hypothesis despite the change in textbooks' generations and political assessments. First, the history of the country and the history of the Ukrainian nation are considered as identical. Second, the approaches, which are well known as "victimization" and "occidentalisation" of national history, were applied to explain Ukrainian history. Third, history itself was considered as a predetermined process driven by the logic of history, not by people's decisions. Objectifying history, the school textbooks interpreted historical incidents from the perspective of the current political agenda. School students built up an image of Ukraine as a colony first of the Moscow state, then of the Russian Empire and the USSR. In conclusion the authors argue that the opposition of Russia and Ukraine, which has been widely used as a tool for the creation of a unified nation in Ukraine, has played a destructive rather than a constructive role for both Ukrainian society and the state.

TI DEFINITION OF MARGINALITY. METHODOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES IN HISTORICAL
   STUDIES
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE marginality; marginal culture; cultural conflict; psychological crisis;
   historiography
AB Definition of marginality is becoming more and more relevant for the Humanities, in this connection its methodological potential for historical science needs to be studied. The emergence of the marginality definition traces back to the American School of Sociology of the 1930s. This definition is based on the social and psychological aspects of socialization and cultural conflict, connected with the period of removal, changing, which can be defined as a crisis. The further development of American Sociology led to the expansion of the described marginality cases. New approaches appeared, marginality became a sociological definition to a large extent, the study of the social causes of marginalization began to dominate. Sociology became the science studying the social structure of the society, and persons, who ''really'' were in a position marginal to the defined social structure, began to be called ''marginal persons''. The psychological aspects of marginality receded into the background. Therefore, in our opinion, the monolithic notion of marginality phenomenon could not be worked out in sociology of our country as well as in sociology of other countries. The scientists either cannot explain the definition of marginal persons or expand this definition to all people. Therefore, to use this definition in the historical science we propose to return to the psychological understanding of this definition and to define marginality as the crisis state of uncertainty, vagueness or self-determination of a person in the world. It means that this understanding of marginality is based not on the position of the person in the social structure, which can be regarded as a secondary phenomenon, but on the doubts of the person about the stability of their social position. Such a person has a definite motivation and demonstrates typical behaviour, what is important to take into account for the study of a medieval person. Ivan the Terrible can be regarded as a glaring example of a marginal medieval person. According to the traditional point of view it is impossible to define Ivan IV as a marginal person, because the Tsar is considered to be on the top of the social hierarchy. Many scientists rather prefer to call him a brain-sick person than to explain his specific behaviour. But the use of marginality conception lets us see the conflict between the Tsar and the society, which was caused not by the different notions of political, ideological doctrines or psychological crises but by the different notions of morality, the due, which underlie socialization. The use of our definition of marginality let us study effectively and distinguish types of marginal groups, for example, insurgent peasants, suppressed ethnic minorities, sectarians, etc.

TI CORPORATE IDENTITY OF NATIONAL UNIVERSITY LECTURERS AT THE END OF THE
   XIX - THE BEGINNING OF THE XXI CENTURY: THE STUDY CONCEPT
SO SIBERIAN HISTORICAL RESEARCH-SIBIRSKIE ISTORICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE faculty staff; university; institute; identity
AB University faculty is a special social category of Russian society. Despite being a relatively sparse group, even from the XIX century, it played a significant part in the life of the country and often was a marker of the social and political processes occurring in Russia. Studying the evolution of teaching staff's corporate identity is critical as application of research approaches offered by this theory provides answers to the questions concerning academic professors' self-identification, university corporate culture formation, university professor's behavioral patterns in different circumstances.
   The project proposes the research into :
   - the characteristics of Russian (Soviet) university professor's corporate identity formation in pre-revoluionary, Soviet and post-Soviet periods;
   - the forms of identity manifestation in different periods;
   - the crises of academic teaching community representatives' corporate identity;
   - the transformation of corporate identity at the end of eras: after the years1917 and 1991;
   - 'levels of identity': the correlation between a person and an institution (university professors), specialists (physicists, doctors), and the whole community (teaching staff).
   One can mention the diversity of research works dedicated to corporate identity, but they mostly focus on the contemporary state of the issue and are created within social studies, pedagogical and psychological approaches. The novelty of the proposed project research is in the examination of the issue of academic teaching staff's corporate identity in historic retrospective with the use of cutting edge research methods.
   The research into Russian university professors' corporate identity lies at the confluence of anthropology, social studies, psychology, pedagogy; it is interdisciplinary in its nature. The ` social' approach, the biographical and prosopographical methods, the method of free self-description will be applied. The analysis of the professor's identity in the Soviet (from the 1960th till the 1970th) and post-Soviet periods stipulates the application of social studies methods: surveys and in-depth interviews with living representatives of the Russian university teaching community.
   The research will be based on the published (laws and regulations by Ministry of Public Instruction, People's Commissariat of Education, Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian/Soviet government) and unpublished sources (archive recordings including documents of universities), periodical press materials, sources of personal origin (diaries, letters, memoirs).
   The accomplishment of the goals set will allow reconstruct the peculiarities of Russian (Soviet) university professor's corporate identity formation in pre-revolutionary, Soviet and post-Soviet periods, the forms of identity manifestation in different periods, the mechanisms of crisis management for academic teaching community representatives' corporate identity, identity levels.

DE national identity; ethnic identity; civic identity; nation; national
   question; social and political thought
AB The article sets research tasks within the project "Problems of national identity in the social and political thought of Russia in the second half of the XIX century". The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of perceptions of the Russian nation on the nature and content of the concepts and projects to solve the national question that were proposed by supporters of various vectors of social and political thought, and to identify the main areas of their adjustment under the influence of specific historical circumstances.
   The prevalent in modern science modernist idea of a state constituted by a nation meaning that only a state created and backed by a nation can be historically successful, does not quite fit into the realities of nation-building processes occurring in the multi-ethnic Russian Empire. At the same time here, within the framework of competing national projects purposefully implemented by various social and political actors, a number of identities was being formed. Each of the subjects relied on a certain potential, political, cultural and intellectual resources that emerged in the course of social, political, ethnic processes in Russia's historical space.
   As such subjects an imperial state and national elites of peoples of the Russian Empire, including that of Russian, should be considered. Here, the special nature of the relationship between the imperial state and the Russian national elite should be taken into account. As a working hypothesis the determining character of Russian national identity has been defined with regards to the so-called "national question" within which not only important identification markers were established, but also the question of the role of the Russian nation in the history of mankind, its present and future, was being dealt with. One of the most important issues as to the national identity was the definition of the Russian nation. Depending on what ethnic or political content it was filled with, the format of the national state system of Russia, the principles of national policy and international relations were defined.
   Traditionally in Russia, closely connected with the issue of national identity, is the notion of civilizational identity To a certain degree, the civilizational identity constituted the first step towards the definition of the features and essence of Russian identity by Russian intellectuals. The debate between Westerners and Slavophiles identified the first markers of Russian identity as Europe or non-Europe. But then, in the process of developing and deepening Russian identification discourse, it went on in the framework of national model, within the dichotomy of ethnic and political national identity.

AB This paper focuses on the financial crisis of 2008 as seen through the lens of power relationships. In particular, what opportunities has it created for strengthening the positions of the economic and political actors vested in power? I pay special attention to the issues of domination by virtue of a constellation of interests in the market. This technique for imposing will was first outlined by Max Weber in Economy and Society ([1922] 1968). Yet, it remains underexplored despite the rich theoretical and practical potential that this concept has, especially in the context of the 2008 crisis and subsequent recovery.

AB In the 1990s, Russia and Iran successfully laid the foundations for interaction and expanded their spheres of cooperation. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, their relations developed unevenly. These fluctuations depended on the combination of global and regional factors, as well as on the internal circumstances in each country. Russia's participation in international sanctions has aroused discontent in Iran. Despite this, the political establishments of both countries continue to demonstrate an interest in developing bilateral relations and to reaffirm their shared geopolitical interests. This paper analyzes foreign policy documents and the latest research by Russian and Iranian scholars. It strives to shed light on the question: To what extent and in what areas do the interests of Russia and Iran coincide, and what is the foundation for their potential future development?

A paradigmatic example of a scientific revolution is the emergence of relativistic physics and quantum mechanics, which, at the beginning of the 20th century, replaced the classical concepts. The development of zoology, of course, does not appear as impressive as that of physics; however, the author of this paper presented at a meeting of the RAS Presidium regards the appearance of a new approach, which combines the classical methods of comparative anatomy, embryology, and paleontology with the new methods of molecular biology, a revolutionary event and proves his point with several impressive discoveries.

AB This article focuses on the genesis of and correlation between the related concepts of enclave and exclave and the scope of their use in different sciences, fields of knowledge, and everyday speech. The author examines the circumstances of their emergence in the reference and professional literature in the Russian language. Special attention is paid to the typology of the world's enclave territories as objects of political geography; at the same time, their new categories and divisions (international enclave, overseas exclaves, internal enclaves of different levels) are extended and introduced. The author offers a new classification of contemporary and historical enclaves and exclaves. The article identifies the specific features of the Kaliningrad region in comparison to other enclave territories. The difference between the exclavity of the Kaliningrad region in the Soviet and post-Soviet periods is emphasised. The author shows the evolution of the use of concepts of enclave and exclave for describing the features of the Kaliningrad region's positions from the perspective of the mother and surrounding states. The article introduces the concept of dividing states and stresses the need to take their interests into account to ensure the functioning of the Russian exclave. The author substantiates the thesis that the Russian region is an enclave of the European Union (but not NATO) and an exclave of the Russian Federation and a number of political and economic intergovernmental alliances with Russian participation. The article offers a generalised characteristic of the Kaliningrad region from the perspective of its enclavity / exclavity.

DE One - Many Problem; noema; intentional object; thinking; interdependence
AB This paper attempts to interpret to eon in Parmenides' poem not as a real object, but as a noema or intentional object of thinking. So, we succeed to J. Barrington's and G.E.L. Owen's approach. We have shown that there is a possible interpretation of Parmenides, in which his proof of "indivisibility (indistin-guishability) to eon" is very convincing one: this proof is based on the assumptions that are difficult to discard without a peep; moreover, this proof allows for the formalization, in which it is logically correct. We have demonstrated that Parmenides's noema is fully determinated by each act of thinking, thanks to which it is thought about. Then we have interpret Parmenides' thesis on "indivisibility (indistinguishability) to eon" as the averment that the intentional objects, which can be determinated only simultaneously, are indistinguishable. The formalization of this proof was carried out in two ways. In both cases, it is proved that if a act thinking, which is directed to noema as some intentional composite (whole) object, is possible in principle, then the constituents of this whole object are indistinguishable from each other. In the first case the constituents are propositions that determine a intentional composite (whole) object, and in the second case - intentional individuals. In our formalization of Parmenides' argument is used the Operator of Thinking from Epistemic Logic. Furthermore, our notation is based on the notation in B. Linsky and E. Zalta's Theory of abstract objects. The most controversial assumption in constructed formal proofs is the assertion that states that internal objects of thinking are identical, if they cannot be thought independently. We can say that the criterion for distinction of intentional objects of thinking is here their ability to independent existence - i.e. the possibility for one object of thinking to be thought about, when the other object of thinking is not thought about. Discussion of these problems can lead to the discussion of the nature of identity and deep epistemological problems.

DE world economy; China's foreign policy,"Silk Road" economic belt; "One
   belt; one road" concept
AB The main trends of the current development of China are the following. First, the growth of domestic political tensions in light of the fight against corruption, and the growing, albeit covert, counter of it by party and military elite. Secondly, the external expansion - as an attempt to compensate for internal political and economic problems. China enters a new path of development, which implies multivariant decisions taken by the government and, therefore, multivariant effects of these decisions both for China itself and for its partners, including Russia. China may intensify or, conversely, slow down the anti-corruption struggle. And, in fact, in both cases domestic political position of Xi Jinping becomes more complicated: either he will make even more enemies, or lose credibility as "The Leader number Three" (after Mao and Deng Xiaoping) in the eyes of society. China could rapidly increase its external economic and military-political expansion, risking to face the growing suspicion of the international community and, above all, of its neighbors. But it may hamper the implementation of the "Silk Road" economic belt ("One belt, one road"), with negative consequences for China. In these circumstances, Xi Jinping is to intensify the anti-corruption campaign and offer a strategic response to the increased political tension - the initiative "One belt, one road", a global process with no space or time restrictions. Its main goal is to build a new transport infrastructure as a basis for the economic expansion of the Chinese capital.

AB The article deals with the environmental ideology evolution and the Green Movement political development - from groups of activists and ecological non-governmental organizations to influential political parties, at both national and international level (mainly in the Western Europe). The overlook covers the period from early 1970s to present. The mass political Green Movement arose in early 1970s in the Western Europe, USA and Australia in response to vivid ecological threats and the inability of national and international authorities to offer effective solutions. From the very beginning, the Greens declared their commitment to the principles of environmental responsibility, global sustainable development, inclusive democracy, consideration for diversity, personal freedom, gender equality and non-violence. In the political field, the Greens meet two main challenges: formation of political agenda with regard to environmental issues; promotion of effective political decisions and economic mechanisms to protect the environment from an anthropogenic impact. Ecological NGOs, especially large international organizations (like Greenpeace) perform public protest actions against the transnational and state corporations' economic activities violating the environment (f. e. Arctic oil extraction, radioactive waste storage, gene engineering in agriculture etc.). But beyond the active political lobbying and drawing of wide public support to acute environmental issues, NGOs are not able to involve into political process directly. Within 1970s-1980s (and also later on) ecological political parties were formed in most Western European countries, with a target to participate in official parliamentary elections at local, regional, national and supra-national level. Many of them succeeded and became influencing in their countries. Political methods used by the Greens are thoroughly analyzed in the paper. Special attention is paid to political strategy and tactics of the German ecological party "Bundnis 90/Die Grunen", as well as to participation of the European Union Green parties in work of the European Parliament. German Greens count for the most successful ecological party not only in Europe, but also worldwide. Using flexible tactics of parliamentary coalitions, they managed to facilitate a general turn of the German policy toward ecologization (renunciation of the atomic energy development in Germany, conservation of energy and renewable energy sources programs, ecological taxes implementation, prohibition on gene engineering in agriculture etc.). Being a part of the governing coalition, the "Bundnis 90/Die Grunen" were also involved in many other social-political and international issues. Since 1984, many European ecological parties are present in the European parliament. In 2004, the European Green Party was created to consolidate electoral efforts of the Greens at the European level. Almost all EU ecological parties are also members of the international Global Greens organization. Owing to activities of the Green Movement as a whole, state authorities of many countries (primarily in the Western Europe) adopted environment friendly legislation and state programs. Despite short periods of reverse, the general development of Greens is progressive and prospective.

AB The following article is written on the basis of published and archival sources. O. Igelstrom's reforms, and also the projects for government of the Kazakh Steppe prepared by some Russian officials, officers and ecclesiastics are considered by the author. Their singularities and differences are shown; the conclusion on their influence on the Russian policy in the region is drawn. The main attention is paid to reforms of O. Igelstrom who created the administrative institutions founded on local political tradition in the Small Horde. He intended to use them as instruments for the Russian influence in the Kazakh steppe. Local patrimonial leaders turned into government officials. But this experience was unsuccessful. Traditional Kazakh institutions didn't conform to requirements of the Russian administration. The failure of those reforms provoked search of new models for the organization of Kazakh steppe's administration. The Orenburg official D. Grankin suggested to refuse patrimonial division of the Small horde and to divide it according to the territorial principle. He suggested to include Russian officials and mullahs in all administrative bodies and to strengthen them by military detachments. The chief of the Siberian Lines Ya. Bouver suggested introducing the territorial division in the Middle Horde close to the imperial one. Expansion of the Russian sociocultural codes to the region was the main idea of his project. In the article considerable attention is paid to proposals of the Orenburg mufti M. Khusainov. He suggested to divide the Small Horde into two parts taking into account the patrimonial principle. The khan with sultans and advisers had to be at the head of each part. The deputies elected by notable Kazakhs had to become a sort of representative body in the part. The group of the armed Russian Muslims had to support safety in the Steppe. The Russian participation in internal administration of the Steppe was offered to minimize. Such approach couldn't satisfy the Russian administration. Search of the most optimum model for Kazakh's administration was continued in the 19th century.

AB The article provides an overview of international and Russian literature on the genesis and development of System Research in IR studies, demonstrates the emergence of System Research in Russia and in the world, the development of the general theory of systems. It is shown that at the first stage, the representatives of natural sciences tried to identify the isomorphism between the international relations system and other systems (biological, physical). In this context, the attempts to form a general theory of international conflict could be viewed. It is noted that at the beginning of the 1970s, these attempts ended unsuccessfully in general. The second area of international relations system modeling is related to the work of structural realists, primarily K. Waltz and M. Kaplan. Despite the fact that in their papers the verbal analysis dominates over the formal international relations system model, they have made a significant contribution to the political science in perception of the systems theory. The paper also describes the system modeling in the context of the Neo-Marxist theory of international relations, first and foremost, in the meaning of the I. Wallerstein's world-system theory. Special attention is paid to the systemic research crisis in the IR science at the turn of 1980-1990s, also due to a sharp change in the international situation, and the transition from a predominantly deterministic world of the Cold War to the post-bipolar non-equilibrium international system. The authors clearly reveal the evolution of the international relations perception in terms of the systems theory. They also illustrate the intensification of the international system modeling in the XXIst century on the basis of a new methodology - via the use of the more sophisticated complexity theory (the theory of complex systems), as well as by adapting the sociological theory of structuration by A. Giddens in political sciences. Showing the most promising areas of the complexity theory practical application in the modeling of international relations - agent-based modeling and simulation of system dynamics, - the authors enumerate the most promising spheres for the system modeling in international studies.

AB Cleavages between economic growth and social development have deepened in recent decades. This is expressed in the growth of multidimensional inequality and is perceived as a global violation of the social justice principles, which leads to the growth of socio-economic conflicts. These are obviously long-term trends allowing to talk about the complete reconfiguration of the existing social space. This process is largely out of control and has a serious destructive potential. The authors emphasize that the modern high-tech economy is unmanned; high quality and secure jobs with permanent contracts are becoming less affordable. As a result, we are witnessing a shift from principles of the previously established social protection institutions, where access to basic social goods is reduced for a large number of citizens. Reforming the system of state support for citizens becomes a worldwide trend, which leads to an increase in the cost of social services and brings into question the very existence of the welfare state. Thus, in the context of social landscape global transformations in the modern world, the social impact of the unemployment problem has become a key issue for researchers and policy-makers. At present, it is difficult to foresee whether the world will continue to develop within a global perspective and whether the international community will be able to produce common regulatory principles, or we are heading for a period of fragmentation and disunity. The problem is largely politically determined, and its solution depends on whether humanity will be able to overcome the difficult period of controversy and confrontation in the name of development, and if so, on what principles consensus can be reached.

DE construct; mentality; Russia; "Holy Russia"; patriotism
AB In moments of deep changes, various paths of historical development and in periods of non-obvious future there appears a necessity to find the ultimate bases of the society identity. Among these bases loaded by the meaning and supreme spiritual values, in relation to Russia, the construct "Holy Russia" is mentioned. Being originated in the era of Russian Middle Ages, it embodied in the well-known Philotheos's formula "Moscow - the Third Rome". Over centuries, the construct played the key role in political culture to substantiate the God's choice of Russian people and the combination of celestial and earth reality on Russian land. Thus, in accordance with the medieval idea, Russia was assigned the role of a kind of "icon" of Celestial Kingdom while the Russian Tsar played the role of the God's reflection on earth. Philotheos's political formula was embodied in the project "New Jerusalem" of Patriarch Nikon, it was adapted by the people and for the people properly to the construct "Holy Russia". Uniting etymologically "holiness" and "light", it manifested the adversarial position of light to the darkness that is to impiety or vicious belief. It can be traced by the author of the article through linguistic research materials and sources. A breakaway from power-religious orthodoxy which was reflected in religious poetry and pastorals, did not affect the basic idea of exclusivity of Russia, but at the same time, the attention was paid to the issues of truth and justice. Russian philosophy (Solovyov V., Trubetskoy E., Berdyaev N.), referring to the problem of "Holy Russia", spotlights the distinction between different levels of Christianity, such as a temple level, a home one and a universal idea. It shows the failure of chiliastic views on the structure of the Kingdom of God on earth. At the same time, being in thrall to the political situation, the philosophers of the first emigration wave repeated those mistakes which they were opposed to. Events of the recent years, complexity of foreign policy situation and a search for bases of identity boosted to quasi-religious writings, where the construct of "Holy Russia" is being newly exploited as a unique one in its originality, total, messianic to imperial desires. All this in a bizarre form combines the rhetoric of "spiritual poems" of the Russian Middle Ages, the first wave of immigrants journalism and at the same time it contradicts the main purpose of the construct - Orthodox unity, the great spiritual values united in this construct of holy men, holy word, holy images, which can only serve the rise of current Russian policy.

AB Extra-regional contacts of Latin American integration unions have been actively developing over last decades. Generally it was the effect of a globalization process. Regional platforms have been created for multi-format cooperation both with separate countries and unions. The motives of inter-union cooperation are the efforts of developing countries to strengthen their bargain power and the requirement to expand export markets. The experience of such partnership between Latin America and different regions allows to define several models characterized by different mechanisms and instruments of a dialogue development (LAC-EU, LAC-US and "South-South" cooperation). There are different approaches to economic integration with extra-regional partners among Latin American unions and countries. A number of them follow open and flexible trade policy, while other establish preferential blocks with restrictions on bilateral trade negotiations. Until now Russia preferred to develop bilateral relations with its key allies in Latin America without building close ties with integration unions. But current geopolitical and economic situation encourages Russia to establish such partnership agreements with regional organizations, which are the rising power on the regional and global scene. Without it the full development of economic and political ties between both regions and their association on the international scene would be complicated. The fact that Eurasian Economic Commission recently launched the negotiations process with MERCOSUR demonstrates that Latin American unions start to be considered as prospective partners. In the future, Eurasian Economic Commission can serve as the main platform for bi-regional partnership.

DE politicization; Europeanisation; political space; multi-level
   governance; mass politics; contentious politics; protest communities;

AB The current recession has stimulated the politicization of the economic regulation in the EU and has brought about a change in the priorities of European integration. European identity landmarks emerge amid a growing interdependence of the European and divergent national political agendas and a "conflictual Europeanisation" of mass politics. Protest publics have come to the forefront of European politics, and a conspicuous rise of the voters support for hybrid anti-establishment parties repudiating traditional politics demonstrates a cumulative effect of dissatisfaction and frustration in both national and European political institutions. Hence a growing support for Eurosceptics in the 2014 European parliamentary elections. As the Greek crisis and the results of the following national elections in Greece testify, the politicization of European integration through contentious politics can be regarded as an answer to the growing alienation of the political and institutional design of contemporary Europe from its social roots. Social welfare, alongside political democracy and a Christian heritage, remains a pillar of a common European identity. Contentious politics break into this political space in diverse, often populist and brutal forms, and point to the need to rethink existing stereotypes about politics and everyday life, about the changing motivation of political action and the changing nature of political actors. Europe faces the necessity to adapt its institutions both to the challenges of effective policies and of democratic politics. The on-going politicization processes can contribute to this end, on condition that the European political elite is capable to face this challenge.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Pacific Russia; Asia-Pacific region; strategic planning; development;
   integration
AB The article aims to put forward new approaches to encouraging the development of Russia's Eastern regions. Firstly, the author describes Pacific Russia as a specific social and economic territory. He insists that in its strategic planning the government has to take into account not only the region's vast territory and unfavorable climate, but its economic and social orientation towards Asia-Pacific region. Secondly, the author analyzes underlying causes of previous failures to speed up Pacific Russia's development. Two factors have stimulated policy towards Russia Pacific: the desire to strengthen Moscow's control over this region and to ensure Russia presence in the APR. Infrastructure improvement, increase of local population, and a stronger binding of this region to European center were the three main pillars of this policy. Traditional instruments such as administrative and political resources and program-oriented planning have been used. The Kremlin actions to implement its goals have yielded some positive results, especially in the field of Russia's advance into the Asia-Pacific and its trade with Northeast Asian countries. However, the efficiency of politico-administrative and intellectual efforts was extremely low, and the purpose to make the Far East a Russia's steady foothold in the Asia Pacific region has not been achieved. Finally, the author claims that from the standpoint of Russia's national interests the development of Pacific Russia region is preferably a strategic rather than an economic project. If Moscow really intends to convert this chronically problematic region into a successful one it has to give up to perceive the region as an appendage of European motherland and to rethink the ideology of its development. Author calls to abandon the idea of socio-economic development of the whole territory of the Far East and to prefer a "zonal development model" with the stress on strategic goals, individual policies for each zone and anthropocentric approach to regional development. Zonal development is based on the recognition of unique functions performed by different territories of Pacific Russia, so these areas should become the subjects of a differentiated policy. Anthropocentric approach means preferential federal investment into human capital, as well as special attention to the local people interests and potential as the resources of Russian policy in the APR.

However the explication of the reasons for action which are not depending on desires on the example of an obligation is possible in a standard case "X ought to do A in C" where the rules of incompatibility, cancellation and balance of the reasons work. Besides, it is shown this distinction of the reasons for action does not work in a case with promises.

DT Article
DE subjective well-being; life satisfaction; feeling of happiness; life and
   work conditions; immigration; public opinion; native population; foreign
   born population
AB Immigration has an ambiguous effect on the subjective well-being (SWB) of receiving societies. Being small, it is rather positive. This conclusion is preliminary and requires further investigations, which corresponds to results of numerous studies of the immigration impact on the objective wellbeing of people in more developed countries. According to these studies, some social groups, mainly low qualified workers, suffer from immigration facing the risks of rising unemployment and lowering incomes. Besides, the increase of the foreign born population with different cultural background originates threats to national identities of natives. At the same time, the inflow of foreigners improves economic performance and as a rule contributes to ameliorating of work and life conditions for the population majority in the receiving countries. The rise of the objective well-being of large social groups, both taking place and being expected, in comparison with its previous indices and with other groups, including immigrants, is refracted in indicators of SWB. Such positive effect was revealed in some recent studies. The conclusion of a positive impact of immigration on SWB in receiving societies looks like a paradox amid a negative public opinion about immigration, demonstrated in street protests against the assault of identities of different cultural backgrounds and in electoral support of anti-immigrant political parties. Nevertheless, such negativism is, first of all, peculiar for the assessments of national sequences of immigration. And these assessments are based on warped perceptions of the scale and impact of the foreign born population flow, being influenced by external factors. Besides, the influence of national assessments on life satisfaction and feeling of happiness is very small. Meanwhile, the public image of the immigration impact on personal life, life of family members and of the home town, which is based on personal experience and more adequate knowledge of local processes, is less critical and more favorable. As opposed to national assessments, the effect of such natives' perception of the immigration micro-social effects on their SWB is much more important. (This is mainly due to a higher significance for SWB of current developments in peoples' personal life and in their immediate social environment, compared to macro-social issues.)

The author briefly acquaints with the main content of reforms of governance of the Orenburg part of the Kazakh steppe in the 1870. The main motives and the purposes of regional administration in carrying out administration reforms in the region and the necessity to take local traditions of the organization of the power into consideration are reflected. The reasons of O.A. Igelstrom's reforms failure are revealed and discussed. The author studies the issue related to the authority and the influence of the khan's power among the Kazakhs and the government measures on the restriction of this power. Attempts of the imperial government to manipulate with elections of new khans are described in the article. Reaction of the Kazakh elite on those actions is shown. The special attention is paid to the movement of Syrym Datov and to the way the Russian government took the advantage of this movement under various political circumstances. Winning round the Kazakh opposition and pushing it away under the changed circumstances, the Russian administration steadily solved one of the main political tasks to replace the elected head by a person or an institution loyal to the emperor and suitable for carrying out the requirements of the Russian regional administration. But it was impossible to solve the problem in the conditions of O. Igelstrom's reforms. The way to achieve the desired goal was opened with M. Speransky's reforms of 1820.

AB Non-profit associations consitute an important part of civil society. Performing the function of self-organization, they are aimed at solving urgent social problems. This article presents the results of the survey research concerning the population's attitude to civil society organizations - the overall awareness and assessment of public organizations, the existing participation level and the future commitment to participate in the activities of these organizations, and the dynamics of these indicators (comparative analysis of the survey results of 2011 and 2014).
   The social base of civil society is analyzed within the framework of he concept offered by the Research Laboratory of Civil Society, HSE. According to the concept, the people are divided in terms of their social activity and form the core, the satellites kernel, the buffer, as well as peripherals and outsiders. Our results demonstrate a tendency of increasing total awareness of the activities of non-governmental organizations with a simultaneous decrease of social activity in most areas. We can see loss of interest in social activities - the trend of reduction in the volume of the nucleus, the satellite and the buffer zone, ie, those segments of the society who have a stable and periodic activity in social activities or principled commitment to that kind of work. At the same time, the share peripherals and outsiders, ie those who are not ready to participate in any social activities and generally possess negative attitude towards civil society organizations is increasing.
   Analysis of the barriers and the catalysts of social activity demonstrated an increase of functional pragmatic attitude with "the lack of spare time" as the main barrier, and the rising importance of personal benefits as the main catalyst.

DE representations of Other; othering mechanisms; discourse; migrants;
   social inequality
AB There are many examples in the history of Western culture of how some of the social groups perceived as 'Other' - strange, wild, irrational, alien or threatening to social order. They appeared as objects of subordination in the process of certain cultural policy that is divided social space into the "center" and "periphery", polarizing into the "us" and "them". The status of some increased by reducing the status of the Other. Different groups can be attributed as Other in modern society, for example: ethnic and sexual minorities, people with disabilities, migrants, poor, that exclude from the "normal values of Western culture" (Spivak, 1999). Social cohesion is questionable, because the society breaks up into different fragments influenced by efforts to protect the group boundaries.
   The objectives of this paper include the study of discursive mechanisms that are used for the division of "ours" from "aliens" and leading to objectification and subordination of the Others. At the beginning, based on the analysis of theoretical and empirical sources were identified certain signs, indicating in the text the presence of alienation process. Next, according to these attributes was created the program of content analysis of media representations of vulnerable groups, for example, migrants. As a result, it was found that migrants depicted in press as Other. Their images are characterized by signs of alienation: the opposition (using binary categories "locals-newcomers"), hierarhization and subordination ("hosts-guests"), desubjectivation (migrants are the "workforce"). In sum, the preliminary results of the analysis show that the official press is dominated by representation on behalf of the government, officials. There are no publications that describe the subjective experience of migrants. There is a neglect for cultural uniqueness and personality characteristics of migrants, which leads to perception of them in terms of economic value as a "workforce", more than in the discourses of equality and values diversity.

AB Competence in the Russian language is one of the main conditions of adaptation of students from Tajikistan studying at the universities of Tomsk. In the twenty-five years since the breakup of the Soviet Union, there have been significant changes in the country's language policy that have affected the state of bilingualism in independent Tajikistan. The article analyses the current level of competence in the Russian language of students from Tajikistan who study in Tomsk (Russia) using detailed individual interviews with Tajik students, representatives of the Tajik diaspora in Tomsk, and teachers at Tomsk and Moscow universities. Attention is given to the individual, social, and institutional conditions that contribute to successful or impeded Russian language acquisition.. The interview materials preserve the lexical and grammatical features of the speech of the respondents and the features of their Russian pronunciation. Competence in the language is considered in the context of the ability of an individual to decode the cultural codes of the receiving community. It is suggested that both a desire to solve the problem and a certain imitation are the objectives of discourse about Russian language acquisition by educational immigrants from near-abroad countries. The paper focuses on the methods of the sending and receiving communities for successful Russian language acquisition by students from Tajikistan as a condition of their successful adaptation to the culture of the receiving community, and the potential use of these methods in various spheres of the national economy of both countries and in international projects. The work of E. Giddens, M. Bennett, and J. Weaver are used as the methodological approach to the research.

DE paradigm of stationary economy; transformation of institutional matrix;
   priorities through parities; ecological literacy
AB Realities of the XXI century demand searching and grounding measures on changing economic, political, and the main thing, ideological institutions that determine trends of evolution and managing vital human activity at national and over-national levels. Using synergetic approach, the authors made an attempt to synthesize conclusions and main theses of neo-institutionalism theory, onto-psychology, as well as results of biological evolution for determining the way to overcome global ecological crisis at nano-level and to form a model of the mankind's optimal evolution on the base of principle "priorities through parities", using DNA-symbol as a code of survival, through co-evolution of economy and ecology.
   The main problem, existing even in economically developed countries, is the realization of the fact that the paradigm of the stationary economy is the only condition for the mankind's survival. To solve this problem serious transformation of ideological institutions is necessary, at the expense of comprehensive and based on onto-psychological methods program of ecological literacy, that should harmonically blend with the presented by the authors triads of state strategic management and achieving the goal of development. It is the transformation of the national matrix, content and direction of which are set in order to ensure a balance of interests of all participants in ecological and economic development, will lay the necessary rules, both formal and informal, in the style of human behavior, social groups, the national economy.
   Realization of the program ecological literacy within the national policy on ecological development of the regions is one of the most important conditions for a natural, not imposed from the outside, prepare to use the paradigm of a sustainable economy as the basis of economic, political and ideological institutions of modern society, which is primarily the formation of a new paradigm of human device - devices nano-level decision-making, consumer behavior.

AB The article contains a critical assessment of two alternative interpretations of the birchbark letter No. 724, proposed by Valentin L. Yanin and Andrei A. Zalizniak (editors of the birchbark collection No. 10, in 2000) and by Pavel V. Petrukhin (2009). According to the former, the document, in which the author describes the difficulties of collecting tribute in the north-eastern periphery of the Novgorod Land, was written between 1161 and 1167, a date based on the identification of the names Zakharia and Andrei mentioned in the text with the Novgorod posadnik Zakharia (1161-1167) and Prince Andrei Bogoliubsky of Suzdal. However, as Petrukhin has shown convincingly, the editors' treatment of the conflict does not conform to the political circumstances of this period as they are known from the chronicles. According to Petrukhin, the document was written half a century later and reflects a routine conflict between local administrators rather than a political confrontation between Novgorod and Suzdal. I argue that the editors' interpretation can be modified in light of Petrukhin's criticism; such a reinterpretation does not presuppose a re-dating of the document and retains the identification of Zakharia and Andrei with historical figures of the 1160s as well as the linguistic analysis proposed by Zalizniak.

AB In this study, the authors give a definition, basis and description of a new conceptual metaphor "solid power". The main hypothesis of the authors is based on the fact that the American concepts of soft and smart power allow to build doctrines, strategies and scenarios that support for ideological formation of policy "hard power" veiled under the idea of promoting the "model" of American democracy and the justification of military intervention and economic pressure on other countries, with the voluntary consent / participation of citizens. The United States are rapidly losing their political credibility in the international arena. De facto: the impetus for this was the events in Ukraine, which exposed the weak points in the American law enforcement scenarios. The authors believe that Russia is pursuing a new script, based on "solid power" as a new form of political power, the basis of which is the: dialogue, trust, unity. The authors came to the conclusion that Russia by using such resource as "solid power" is able to withstand "hard power", that is the power that actually became a legitimate tool of American foreign policy.

DE Muslims; Europe; Islam; political integration; immigration policy;
   nation-building; centers and inner periphery; multiculturalism; hybrid
   identity; tolerance; xenophobia; right-wing radicals
AB The article discusses the problem of Muslim political integration into European society, which cause considerable controversy both in political science community and among general public, and is insufficiently studied in Russian historiography. Analyzing the issue the authors follow the logic of Rokkan-Hirschman model, explaining the impact of the center-periphery polarity on the creation of boundaries and membership in the nation-state. It is shown that Muslim immigrants form today the inner periphery of European polities which generates a new socio-cultural and socio-economic cleavage. They point out that over time there appeared a human right based liberal-democratic paradigm, which now underlies the different immigration policies of European authorities. This policy of unmanaged multiculturalism allowed immigrants to remain a closed community (inner periphery) within the country of residence. The growth of Islamic extremism prompted the European governments to intensify work on political integration of Muslims and to tighten the immigration policies in a number of aspects. The authors believe the participation of Muslims in the political life of European countries is becoming more significant. They take part in national and local elections, enter the national representation bodies and hold demonstrations so as to defend their interests. Much attention is given to the analysis of intercultural communication. It is noted that in Europe now exists an extensive layer of moderate Muslims to varying degrees integrated into Western society. A hybrid identity has become widespread and many consider themselves to be representatives of both a European country and Muslim community. However, in a heterogeneous environment Islamist influence grows and although they often hold moderate positions they do not always share Western values, but support Sharia-guided lifestyle. On the other hand in the wake of the global economic crisis anti-immigrant sentiment has intensified and strengthened the right-wing nationalist forces. The authors come to a conclusion that in spite of existing challenges the democratic ideals and practices are supported by a large part of Muslims, which makes their political integration into European society quite possible.

DE Egypt; Muslim Brothers; elections; referendum; al-Sisi; army
AB Between 26 and 28 May 2014 p.esidential elections were held in Egypt. The majority of voters (96.91%) voted in favor of ex-Defense Minister Abd al-Fattah al-Sisi, whereas only 3.09% of the votes were cast for the leader of the Egyptian legal leftist opposition, Chairman of the Egyptian Popular Current Hamdeen Sabahi. It is known that the main opponent to the election of a new president was the banned Muslim Brothers movement, whose de facto leader Mohamed Morsi was ousted as a result of the "June 30 Revolution," and the action of the constitution (adopted in December 2012, during his reign) was suspended. The Muslim Brothers urged their supporters to boycott the presidential elections in 2014. Our mathematical analysis of the results of the May 2014 Egyptian presidential elections shows that the level of support by the Egyptians of the Muslim Brotherhood in the first five months of 2014 grew very noticeable (especially in Middle Egypt), and a more or less high level of support of the al-Sisi regime was only observed in May 2014 in most provinces of the Delta as well as in Port Said.

TI MYTH AS A CATEGORY OF SYMBOLIC POLITICS: ANALYSIS OF THEORETICAL
   JUNCTIONS
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE political myth; ideology; symbolic politics; social constructivism;
   mythologization; communication; frame
AB The article describes theoretical junctions revealed by different definitions and usages of the concept "political myth". It argues that the main difficulty results from the fact that "myth" is a "universal" social phenomenon that is rather "particular" in its manifestation: it is fundamental for any society, but its "work" depends on perception of specific groups in concrete contexts. The article considers theoretical discussions about a narrative nature of contemporary myths, their exclusively verbal or non-verbal form, about arrangement of mythical comprehension of reality and mechanisms of mythologization, about connections between myths and ideologies. However most scholars agree that about capability to be shared and perceived as "a natural order of things" should be considered a key characteristic of any myth. This category is fundamental for analysis of symbolic politics. However its heuristic potential depends on a particular research focus. In the frame of narrower approach that considers symbolic politics as a "constructivist" activity of political elites aimed at manipulation of mass consciousness "the myth" comes as a category of political practice; it points to "artificial", simulating character of the constructed signs. While a wider approach viewing symbolic politics as a social production of competing ways of interpretation of reality and struggle for their domination opens a perspective for considering myth as communicative process that involves both mythmakers and their auditory. It makes focus on a study of both political and semantic conditions that make particular myth a "lens" that determines perception of reality. So, myth turns to be both category of practice in symbolic politics and instrument of its analysis which makes the work with this term rather complicated.

ID CIVILIZATIONAL ANALYSIS; SOCIOLOGY
AB The article discusses political processes in post-Soviet Russia from the perspective of the multiple modernities theory. A study of Russia's political transformation on the basis of this approach allows us to reconsider the obstacles to democratization that existed in the 1990s and the socio-cultural preconditions for de-democratization in the 2000s. The author draws on Johann Arnason's analysis of the Soviet model of modernity. From this perspective the Soviet model possessed only some civilizational traits and did not lead to a sustainable civilizational pattern. Nevertheless, remnants of that model and the imperial legacy of the Soviet period influenced Russian politics of the last two decades. The dynamics of democratization and de-democratization in Russia represent a case of path dependency which is both post-communist and post-imperial.

AB The authors reviews Central and Eastern European scholar's scientific papers of Soviet history and the history of communism in which Stalinism is treated as a special object of study or considered in the context of the other problems of Soviet, European and world history. The study focuses on the scientific literature (monographs, journal articles, collections of articles), prepared and published in the Central and Eastern Europe in the second half of the 1980s to the present day. Thus, it is possible to speak of a new component of the European historiography of Stalinism.
   The conditions of modern methodological pluralism provide a choice of integrated multi-disciplinary approach as a concrete methodology of historiographical research. This allows attracting theoretical ideas and techniques of other fields of scientific knowledge for the study of historical processes. Today, the situation in science is such that it is necessary to hear different voices, to be able let in the "other" in your discourse. The study of European historiography of Stalinism enables us to connect the historical, political, anthropological, psychological, and cultural components. Each of them played a role in a particular segment of the discipline development, and in the formation of a collective historical memory.

AB The academic circles and media commonly associate political uncertainty with aggravated economic risks, discouraged investments, and stunted economic growth. The goal of this survey is to explore the reaction of domestic businesses to political signaling. It allows addressing a key question regarding the perception of uncertainty in Russia: how sensitive are the economic agents to political trends? How robust is their assessment of the extent to which the rules of the game are changing, and what are the threshold levels of political change at which the uncertainty begins to affect economic decisions? Due to the sensitive nature of questions, a large-N randomized selection was not feasible, and we relied on a small sample of convenience. The study focuses on the case of Nizhny Novgorod region in Russia and is based on a survey of the owners and employees of small-and medium-size businesses. The data, collected in 2014 and 2015, provides tentative insights into the correspondence between political signals and local economic calculus in today's Russia. The study demonstrates that the local businesses are aware of the political costs, especially high levels of corruption and the general arbitrariness of power. They also appear to dismiss the probability of substantive changes in political status quo.

AB The article introduces new perspective on political symbolization as a state of political reality. Availability of symbolic influence in political context implies common knowledge; nevertheless, it does not reflect predetermined reaction to following information. Therefore, we have to discern between semantics (meaning of the language) and sense of the conversations (meaning of the speech itself). The article draws substance of political symbolization from the theory of the symbol, introduced by German romantics, who highly valued symbols as a matter of human aesthetics. Author exposes the contradiction between the use of the symbol's "privileged status" in the dimension of aesthetics and neglect of its very essence within social sciences. Political symbolization is conceptualized in terms of multiplicity of unstated meanings in communication within political context. These findings of the article have the significant implication: political symbolization is a rare and unpredictable phenomenon; it becomes "visible" as if it has been happening in the reality, but still in collective perception due to dispositions of interpreters political symbolization is presented more essential than the viscera of life.

DT Article
DE public policy; consistency of institutions; public interests;
   government; civil society; public participation
AB The paper discusses the formation and advocacy of public interests. It is shown that under conditions of increasing complexity and multidimensionality of the transforming Russian socium, as well as emerging pluralism of socio-political interests, the request of civil society for consistency of the institute of advocacy and promotion of public interests in the public sphere is growing. Modality of this request is increased by the crisis of social development. With the dominance of administrative-bureaucratic approaches to building public policy a falsification of feedbacks is occurred along with dysfunction of the public sphere in the direction of strengthening the influence of corporate and bureaucratic interests against the public interests. That inevitably leads to increased social tensions and protests as well to a loss of confidence in state activities and decline of legitimacy of political power. The development of institutions of public participation, mechanisms of intersectoral social partnerships contribute to improvement of interaction between government and society, as well as to effectiveness of social representation of public interests in the conditions of incompleteness of the processes of socio-political transformation; it also stimulates the public administration reform in the direction of greater openness and publicity. That allows to more adequately take into account the increasing pluralism and mobility of social groups and their socio-cultural preferences. Improvement in the functioning of the institute of formation and advocacy of public interests raises importance of the category of citizenship, which is considered to be an important resource and the basis of raising the quality and democratic character of modern public administration. The article also summarizes the findings of case studies dealing with identification and advocacy of public interests in three Russian regions (Kostroma, Tatarstan Republic and Yaroslavl).

AB The article analyses the privilege of the grand duke of Lithuania Alexander for the Smolensk land granted on the 1st of March, 1505. Its original has survived in the Main Archive of the Old Acts (Archiwum Glowne Akt Dawnych) in Warsaw. The author defines more exactly its components and their dating (the oldest privilege of grand duke Casimir Jagiellonian for the Smolensk land of 1447, his and his counsellors' judicial decision on the litigation between the Smolensk dwellers and its governor Mikolaj Radziwill of 1482-1488, the same monarch's order for him of 1482-1488 and Alexander's order for Smolensk governor Stanislaw Hlebowicz of 1492-1499). The comparison of the oldest part of the Smolensk land privilege with the same documents for the lands of Novgorodok, Vitebsk, Polotsk and Volhynia brings to the conclusion that the Smolensk dwellers were interested in the fixation of the interests balance with the central authority on the regional level rather than in gaining estate privileges according to the Polish model "from above". The analysis of the Smolensk dwellers' relations with the state authorities from the middle of the 15th century to the beginning of the 16th century shows, how the land privilege as a new document for the local society was taking root (this process went faster at the beginning of the 16th century). At the same time the traditional notion of the monarch's mercy continued to exist, the links with the Grand Duchy's political elite were established, and it was probably its members (the grand duke and the Radziwill family) who initiated the granting of an extensive privilege to the Smolensk land at the sejm (convention) in Brest in 1505. The development of that tradition was interrupted because of the Smolensk boyars' and citizens resettlement after the annexation of the Smolensk land by the Russian state in 1514.

AB The aim of this study is to search for a mechanism for implementing large investment projects of crucial economic importance in the modern economic conditions characterized by the sanction policy of foreign states, limited public investment, and a mass exodus of foreign investors.
   An example of a large-scale investment project is the construction of a multipurpose multimodal complex the commercial seaport of Ust-Luga. This is one of the most recent large projects in seaport infrastructure development.
   This article estimates the project's significance for the development of the Baltic region and presents a competitive analysis of the seaport position in comparison to the largest European ports.
   The authors analyze the strengths of the seaport construction project, namely, the favorable natural environment and climate, advantageous geographical position, strong political will demonstrated by the federal and regional authorities. The article also considers the challenges the project faces - unfortunate geopolitical situation, growing competition from other seaports, and lack of investment.
   Based on the analysis of challenges, it is concluded that there are significant risks associated predominantly with lack of investment.
   In these conditions, a large investment project requires the enhancement of public-private partnership, which will ensure the timely implementation of such projects.

AB The critique of the deliberative turn in political theory brought about a discussion of democratic theory with a special focus on value pluralism versus consensus. Chantal Mouffe provides one of the most sophisticated alternatives to deliberative democratic theory, calling her own project "agonistic pluralism." When scrutinizing this theory, scholars have primarily focused on its internal controversies. The author argues that despite its problems, the project of agonistic pluralism should still be considered. This paper seeks to overcome the existing controversies of Mouffe's proposed project and to offer ways in which it can be strengthened.
   Using Carl Schmitt's theories is problematic in two ways. First, the hegemonic nature of conflictual consensus entails depoliticization of adversaries' agonistic relations. Second, Schmitt's interpretation of the political blurs all differences between agonism and antagonism. According to the principles of deconstruction, in this paper, I will re-conceptualize the political in Mouffe's agonistic pluralism. Arendt's concept of the political enables firstly to divorce antagonism (violence) from agonism (political relations), and seoncdly to undermine the hegemonic nature of conflictual consensus by aesthetizising politics. Finally, the integration of Arendt's concept of the political in Mouffe's agonistic pluralism reinforces this theory and allows it to overcome the binary opposition of pluralism-consensus.

AB This paper focuses on dynamics of V. Putin's image during 15 years of his rule both in the role of the President and in the role of the Prime-Minister. Analysis is based on a longitudinal empirical study of Russian politicians' images that the author caries out for more than 20 years. Putin's image has been studied from the end of 1999 till the beginning of 2015. Methodology used in this study enables to reveal not only rational but also unconscious aspects of Putin's perception. The author comes to the conclusion that 15 years not only Putin himself has changed as a person but the society went to a substantial changes that were caused by arrival of new generations of citizens into politics and wide use of new forms of political communication. An incredible growth of Putin's popularity in Russian society that happened in 2014 was connected not only by particular political decisions (unification with Crimea) but also with transformation of a value structure of Russian society and crystallization of a national idea that could not be consolidated during all the Post-Soviet period.

AB The article presents the first part of the study on transformation of war in the XIX-XX centuries. As an introduction to the topic it proposes the description of the processes (of the XVI-XIX centuries) which "modernize" war. Main section of the article examines the discursive move from "the art of war" to the "war science", from eclectic treatises about war of the XVI-XVIII centuries to professionalized theory of the XIX century. The concept of "modernity" within this discursive move marks such things as renunciation of the classical war's "receipt", commitment to the actual (military, political and technological) order and calculation of logistic capability and political expediency.

DE investment; private resources; socio-economic development; economic
   growth; enterprises; projects; public-private partnership
AB The modern stage of Russia's socio-economic development is characterized by the lack of budgetary resources to finance both strategic and current tasks. The situation is exacerbated by the introduction of political and economic sanctions, the significant fluctuations in oil prices and the ruble exchange rate, the growing mistrust on the part of business, followed by the increase in capital outflow. These circumstances predetermine the search for the ways to solve the socio-economic problems.
   The studies of leading Russian and foreign scientists prove that investment plays a major role in ensuring sustainable economic growth and solving the problems of territorial development. Moreover, the recently increasing impact of large companies on the country's development and the low budget lead to the necessity to attract private investment resources for regional development.
   In this regard, the authors analyze the investment activity in Russia, present the countries' rankings by the state of investment climate and disclose the successful experience of business' participation in socially significant regional projects.
   The periodicals and Internet resources comprise an information base of this study. To achieve this goal the authors use system and integrated approaches, general scientific research methods (comparative analysis, generalization and comparison), table and graphical methods of information processing.
   The results of the research help prove the need to attract private investment in distressed areas and provide the Vologda Oblast authorities with the recommendations that can be applied in other regions. The work describes the promising priority projects of the region. Their implementation will contribute to the restoration of positive investment growth. The authors suggest the directions to amend the federal legislation in order to stimulate investment activity of enterprises and, therefore, enhance the role of business in regional development.

AB The content of environmental education at any level of an educational system seems to be evident and universal because of the gravity of contemporary environmental challenges. However obvious differentiation of environmental knowledge is an unresolved issue both in educational practice and in philosophy of environmental education. The environmental education on the whole and ecology as a course at school or university are determined by technological, social, political, legal and cultural factors. Besides, environmental education and its philosophical foundation depend on actual peculiarities of a country development. The factors influencing philosophical reasoning about environmental education in contemporary Russia and revealed in the paper are the following: the reactualization of non-Marxist traditions in Russian philosophy, educational tradition of knowledge paradigm, socially inactiveness of Russians, depending on state decisions, bureaucratic organization of science branches.

Wettstein, assimilating definite descriptions to demonstratives, and the theory by D. Kaplan and G. Marti, assimilating definite descriptions to proper names, are analyzed as examples of the semantic approach. It is shown that both semantic theories make assumptions that are not necessary from the pragmatic point of view. The conclusion is that, ceteris paribus, the pragmatic approach is preferable for reasons of economy.

AB The subject of the paper is the problem of interpretation of definite descriptions in sentences containing a definite description and a singular term. I argue that, in such contexts, definite descriptions can be interpreted, in the light of the Russellian analysis, in two ways: as singular terms and as individuating predicates. These interpretations demand to interpret the sentence copula as expressing the identity or the subject-predicate relation respectively. I criticize V. Surovtsev's claim that, in contexts specified, definite descriptions allow for the first interpretation only.

AB The paper is focused on the evolution of scientific knowledge interpretation in different concepts of knowledge production. To that end the comparative analysis of "knowledge" concept in knowledge society and in technoscience is done. Both conceptions significantly change the function of the knowledge, since it is shown as constituting element in the structure of the social reality. The reality studied by social epistemology and technoscience is more polydimensional. It is described not with fundamentalists' position based on the subject-object dualism, but using functionalist ideology. Functional relations form independent theoretical frame for research of complex selfdeveloping systems of the various nature. In light of this approach the fears of loss of fundamental research significance as a result of technoscience development are not reasonable. Moreover the character of the scientific cognition is changed. Scientific knowledge is still directed at truth, but at the same time it found new dimensions. "Knowledge" in nonclassical epistemology acquired not only gnoseological, but ontological and ethical dimensions.

AB The well-known philosophical "Hume's Guillotine" ("is-ought problem") within framework of J. Searl's theory of rationality and early E. Husserls's phenomenology ("Logical Investigations" period) is considered in the article. It is necessary to consider the problem in two stages: 1. J.Searl's interpretation and solving the problem; 2. the possible objection and refutation by phenomenological philosophy. It may be assumed that two ways of interpretation of "is-out problem" are developed in the history of philosophy. The first method suggests that ethics can be constructed on the basis of the facts. Thus the values grow from the facts. The second way asserts the opposite and says that the facts exist separately from the values. The question is can J. Searl's analysis of action satisfy the requirements which makes phenomenology to rationality. J. Searl's theory confirms the bases for normative judgements are created in actual acts of communication. Phenomenology asks a question about the existence of the a priori rules laying in the basis of the rules of the success of social act.

DE popular science; journalism; expertise; professionalisation
AB I analyze the phenomenon of science journalism in Russia in conceptual frameworks sociology professions and sociology of science. The article focuses on the genealogy of the professional community from the soviet time to nowadays. Original typology of science journalism included in the content of the article. The study bases on the empirical data that collected in the process of work in the collective research project about Popular science in Russia. Soviet time gave the start for the active development science journalism. Famous magazines ("Science and Life", "Chemistry and Life", "Nature", "Technology for youth") became the generator of science popularization in USSR and were the area for the establishment of the professional community science journalists.
   In XXI century new stage of science popularization has been started because Russian science gave financial support and internet discover new opportunities for the getting additional audition. International mode "Popular science" appeared in context of the Russian science popularization. New Popular Science internet resources were created during first decade of 2000th. Government initiated radical reform of education and science and needed in places for propaganda and discussing round problems of reforms. Experts discussed about several aspects of the development Russian science in new conditions. There are two epistemic cultures in contemporary Russian science journalism. "Classic culture" inherited many features soviet tradition of the science knowledge popularization. "Medialised culture" is growing now and combines elements of global phenomenon Popular Science and media entertainment.
   New concept of science popularization is "edutainment". The edutainment approach assumes that modern mass audition can't to percept serious science information in traditional forms because contemporary pop culture base on easy forms of visual interactive informational content. Interactive Popular Science waits from audition more deep involvement in the interaction with science knowledge and experiments. New type of science museums give us possibility participate in practical science experiments and even "produced" personal scientific discovery. New Popular Science magazines attracts new readers to colorful illustrations, unpredictable content and stories about fashionable devices.
   Youtube and other visual opportunities of web open access for new ways to the distributing science knowledge. For example, global conference network Ted (Technology Entertainment Design) is new format of exchange popular science information. TED internet resource contents a lot of short bright video presentations in several disciplines: from biotechnology to ancient human history. In Russia Postnauka.ru is new media project with the same idea and format. It is new direction for the development innovations forms of science journalism.
   Russian community of science journalists has active social position about important problems of the distribution science knowledge. They are experts in complicated situations plagiarism and parascience and pseudoscience. This article explains why science journalists have expert power in these problems. A lot of professional science journalists have PhD-level degrees and can be experts in different sciences. Science journalism is interesting object for study in the perspective of sociology of science and sociology professions.

AB The scholarly interest in phenomenon of foreign aid has remained strong for almost seven decades. The best representatives of social sciences in the West keep providing increasingly more exquisite interpretations of international development cooperation policies. This paper summarizes their conclusions on the impact of domestic socio-political factors within the OECD DAC member countries which have been overshadowed by their foreign economic and political interests in developing countries. In accordance with Carol Lancaster's typology, these determinants are divided into four sub-categories: 1) "ideas" - system of shared values; 2) "institutions" - particularities of political system and electoral processes; 3) "organization" - model of aid management, and 4) "interests" - role of interest groups and public opinion. The paper unveils and explains the main inconsistencies in extant explicative models and identifies some promising directions for future research, including identification of linkages between political and economic as well as between domestic and external determinants of foreign aid.

AB In 1930-31 in the USSR turned the case of the all-Union military officer counterrevolutionary organization "Spring" directed against former officers in the Red army. Despite a number of publications, this case remains practically unexplored. The materials are stored in Departmental archives of the security service of Ukraine. There were many bright individuals arrested as part of the "Spring". Protocols of their interrogations contain valuable materials on military-political history of our country. An article on the basis of the archival data is introducing for the first time into scientific circulation the investigation materials of the outstanding Russian military scientist and theorist, A. A. Svechin, arrested on the case of "Spring" in 1931-1932. All the evidences by Svechin are fully published for the first time. They concern the events of the Russian Civil war, history of Russian army, the life of former officers in the Soviet Russia and the USSR, the relations in the circle of former General Staff officers. The logic of the investigation and tactics of the detainee is analyzed and the conclusions on the peculiarities of political repressions of that period from the Svechin case are made. Publication of the materials of Svechin case gives an opportunity to fill a gap in the biography of an outstanding Russian military leader, his testimony contains interesting data about the relationship in the circle of former officers remaining in the USSR. The investigation materials are quite typical and similar in the other cases of former officers. The file is opened by an objective evidence relating to the epoch of the revolution and the Civil war and the 1920s and to the relationship of the "former". Then they are followed by self-incriminating testimonies, where Svechin repents of belonging to an organized counter-revolutionary underground. Further, it contains testimonies on his comrades, who were accused of the same offences. But there is no documentary evidence of counter-revolutionary manifestations. The materials of the case "Spring" testify to one of the stages of "crackdown" by the Soviet leadership, committed to the establishment of large industrial power and eliminating any manifestations of dissent.

AB A key element of the agenda of re-centralisation launched by the Russian authorities in the early 2000s was the territorial penetration of national political parties. This analysis empirically demonstrates that despite all efforts at institutional engineering, political regionalism survived and flourished in the form of regional electoral coalitions (blocs) in 2003-2005, which created a crucial obstacle to the pro-government party's monopolistic control over regional legislatures. While this obstacle was removed during the process of authoritarian transformation, recent developments in Russian politics suggest that there is a potential for the return of political regionalism.

AB The article combines short texts which were prepared for the dictionary of the sociology of religion, and from the author's point of view, focus on five critical concepts of the discipline. This series of concepts discussed in the paper begins with the term "religious conversion", where the history of the concept, the specific social context, and the functions of relevant events and processes are considered. The second critical concept reviewed is that of the notion of "charisma", with particular attention paid to the evolution of corresponding mythologems and the scenarios for their adaptation to specific contexts of sociology, political science, and business management. The third concept is the analysis of "sacred", which is regarded as an integral definition of the objects of religious experience. Then, the notion of "civil religion" is discussed; the corresponding range of phenomena is viewed as a structure that mediates the relationships between society's political culture and religion. The fifth concept analysed is the term "religious identity", which is treated as designating invariant structures of individual's everyday religious experience and derived from the identification both with transcendent "matters of faith" and with corresponding cult "community of the faithful". In order to make the study of the materials easier, the concepts are arranged in order of the conversion of the "natural person", as we are all born, and form a quite adequate introduction to the subject of the sociology of religion.

AB The task of this work is to determine - with recourse to modified technique of analyzing geopolitical discourse proposed by G. Toal - the Russian geopolitical discourse about North Caucasus and to compare it with the opinions of inhabitants of the region itself. Three kinds of sources have been applied. First, we have considered estimations of the most significant events in the region by the head of the Russian state. Second, publications related to North Caucasus have been studied. Analyzed have been two time periods: from October 2005 to September 2006 and from January to December 2010) of three all-Russian newspapers representing the spectrum of the country's public opinion: the "Sovetskaya Rosiya", reflecting positions of the left forces; the "Zavtra" newspaper representing the viewpoint of national patriotic opposition; and the "Novaya gazeta" coming out from liberal positions. And, third, materials of all-Russian and regional public opinion polls have been used. It has been established that the official optimistic position is rather unpopular in the region itself. As distinct from the said position, the oppositional discourse is of an alarmist character. At the same time there are questions arousing consensus of all political forces and of the population, which allows to stand a chance for solution of a number of problems.

DE Novgorod; Old Rus'; medieval republics; veche; popular assemblies; the
   Hansa
AB The article is a study of the two collective political bodies of medieval Novgorod the veche (popular assembly) and the so called "Council of Lords." The basis of research is mostly the Hanseatic documents in Middle Low German and Latin which have been underestimated until now. However, they are often more trustworthy than narrative sources with their literary cliches and ideological biases.
   Both Russian and Hanseatic sources indicate that the veche was a real political institution which was open to all townsmen enjoying full rights regardless of social status. On the other hand, the sources give no grounds to suggest the rural population's involvement in the Novgorodian veche. The author also argues that a governmental council did really exist in medieval Novgorod. There is some evidence of it in Hanseatic sources of the 14-15th centuries. However, no traces of its existence before the it can be discovered. The council included the highest magistrates of the Novgorodian republic and was referred to in Hanseatic documents as de heren (gospodci).
   Finally the author comes to the conclusion that the Novgorodian medieval polity should be studied in the broader context of European medieval city republics.

DE corporate accountability; corporate governance; stakeholders;

   theory; morality; mechanism of stakeholder accountability
AB Accountability is quintessence of any corporate governance debate despite that there is no unified doctrine what accountability consists of. Academics, politicians and businessmen advocate different categories as the foundation of this doctrine. To some extent this diversity can be explained by an eternal conflict of agency and stakeholder theories in corporate law.
   This essay examines such aspects of corporate accountability as accounts and financial reporting, compliance to certain efficiency indicators and stakeholders' interests including moral values, their roles for various groups of stakeholders.
   For these purposes author analyses the development of agency and stakeholders' theories in regard to financial reporting, provides evidences of stakeholder accountability in case law and legislation are provide and identifies difficulties of stakeholder accountability. It is argued that there is no universal definition of efficiency as a type of accountability and it may be defined through risk management and internal control systems only. Morality is also an ambiguous category for corporate accountability originated rather from political science than jurisprudence and may be used only like supplementary remedy.
   That analysis allows justification of the absence of conflict between different definitions of accountability, inextricably links between them and their joint application as a guarantee of the achievement of accountability objectives.

DT Article
DE left-wing conservatism; conservatism; socialism; communism; the
   Communist party of the Russian Federation; tradition; nationalism;
   Slavophilism; Eurasianism
AB It is generally accepted that socialism and conservatism have nothing in common. In Russia however the large political organization, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (the CPRF), exists whose ideology includes both left-wing (soviet, communist) and right-wing (traditionalist) values. That's why we may treat the CPRF as left-wing conservative party. But why is such a combination of left-wing and conservative concepts possible? In search of explanation, the author analyses the mutual relations between conservatism and socialism in 19th and 20th centuries. He stresses that already in 19th century conservatism and socialism possessed some contact points. Both socialists and conservatives denied liberal civilization based on individualism and rationalism. In tsarist Russia Slavophiles and radical populists (narodniki) contrasted the values of Russian peasant community with the individualism of bourgeois Europe. After the 1917 October revolution some intellectual trends emerged which regarded the revolution and communism as a continuation of Russian tradition ("national bolshevism", Eurasianism, communist "neo-slavophilisme" of 1970s). In the author's view they were spiritual forerunners of modern Russian left-wing conservatism. After the Russian Communist party's restoration in 1993 left-wing conservatism became the dominant trend in its leadership. In the midst of 1990s the leader of the CPRF Gennadyi Zyuganov revised ideology of the party combining communism with Russian patriotism, Marxism with the views of Russian conservative philosophers. Zyuganov asserted that Russian tradition had communitarian, collectivist and statist nature, and socialism therefore was its organic product. In his opinion the main task of the CPRF was to carry out the synthesis of "red" ideal of social justice and "white" ideal of powerful national state. Analyzing the worldview of the CPRF the author draws a conclusion that Russian communists' left-wing conservatism has some common points with authentic conservatism but at the same time it possesses certain reactionary features.

DT Article
DE Shariat; legislation; Russian law; modes of Shariat norms
   implementation; historical and local traditions; adat; polygamy; waqf;
   Shariat court; local government; dispositive norms
AB The article is devoted to analysis of the forms of interaction between Shariat and legislation in action as well as compatibility of Shariat with contemporary Russian law in general. The author touches several reasons of increasing interest to the role which Shariat plays in legal development of Russia. Among these reasons he pays attention to the up-going process of renaissance of Islam, social and political activity of Muslim communities outside the regions where Islam is traditionally spread, the existing threat of Islamic extremism, increasing influence of Shariat upon political and legal development of the Muslim world. Also there are numerous conflicts linked with Muslim minorities in the West which contribute a lot to the interest paid to Shariat.
   Several modes of referring to Shariat can be differentiated as far as its correlations with positive legislation are concerned. One of them manifests itself in the actions of Muslim separatists and extremists who directly oppose Shariat to the Russian law. Another mode provides for including of Shariat norms in the official legislation. There is one more form of the above mentioned correlation which is related with the action of Shariat as alternative regulator without opposing it to the official state law.
   There is no one definite justification for the realization of Shariat provisions. For instance Muslim radicals refer only to religious arguments to fulfil their plans aiming at replacing official legislation by Shariat. Some Rissian scientists call for legalizing of Shariat norms but they do not put down any legal grounds or justification for their proposals. Russian jurists have different approaches to this issue. Some authors elaborate general conceptions which key point is legal recognition of local traditions and customs including Shariat norms. As a rule these theories concern Russian regions of Northern Caucasus.
   The author examines several patterns of possible correlation between Shariat and state legislation. The first one is represented by the direct inclusion of Shariat norms into the legislation. The Russian law provides for such implementation under some conditions. The leading one is choosing among Shariat provisions those which meet criteria of legal norm and can be considered as Islamic law in proper sense. The other form of the correlation mentioned above manifests itself in legal acts which refer to the historical and local traditions. It means in indirect form the possibility of implementation of some Shariat norms. Besides that Shariat provisions can be used for solving issues which are provided for by dispositive norms of state legislation. Generally the author gives positive answer to the question put in the title of the article.

AB The objective of this paper is to study the relationship between the demand for human rights and the demand for economic prosperity from the "exit" perspective, looking at migration patterns. We investigate intra-national migration in India, which is a federation of various states that feature significant economic and political differences. The paper finds that the quality of human rights protection and the economic well-being in the target state are substitutes with respect to determining patterns of migration. These results depend on framing effects; human rights complaints appear to be interpreted differently by migrants, depending on the trust in the government in the target state. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI THE NEW DIMENSIONS OF RUSSIA'S GEOPOLITICAL CODE
SO TURKISH POLICY QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB The debate of whether Russia belongs to the European civilization has been a long-running one. Russian elites have traditionally held that Russia should follow the European track of development, while the masses have held rather anti-Western views. Currently we are seeing sea changes in how the Russian elite view Russia's geopolitical code. In foreign policy, the regional dimension is getting ahead of the global one, while the pro-Western sentiment is reversing. It is now the first time the political elite in Russia has taken the same stance as the majority of the population and is playing the anti-Western card as leverage in domestic policies. This article analyzes the evolution of Russia's geopolitical code over the last two decades and identifies the reasons for this shift. The article also analyzes the factor of European consciousness, concluding that, failing to accept Russia, Turkey, and Israel as equal partners of the West and its outposts in advancing Western values, Europe shrank back to the mental frontiers of the Middle Age.

DT Article
DE state; civil society; power relations; innovative type of development;
   democracy; network social movements
AB An overall social upheaval is now taking place in the world (globalization and technological breakthrough) - upheaval that means transition of civilization toward a new, innovative type of development. It initiates changes in the power field's configuration. The rapidly growing networks of creative life activity require cardinal innovations providing for combining the management of social processes with mechanisms spontaneously arising from the said processes: mechanisms of self-government, of self-organization and of self-regulation. Hence the tendency to redivision of the power functions between the state and the civil society. It may be assumed that the new social practices of power relations revitalize direct democracy, direct influence of the permanently reflecting society on political processes, and that there occurs formation of a new, higher form of people's power, under which a policy is sunk into the milieu of public reflection. But realization of the outlined possibilities will require quite a period of transformation both of political institutions and of social consciousness.

One can see that along with a general growth of citizens' critical attitudes toward the authorities, the perception of V.Putin improved in many aspects. For all that, some negative traits are pronounced regarding his image, too (both the very same that had been marked before the elections, and quite new ones), but the gap between V.Putin and the other former candidates continues to widen.

DE Durkheim; sacred; profane; collective; individual; communion; solidarity
AB The paper focuses on Emile Durkheim's philosophical-anthropological views, particularly on the structure of his argument in "The Dualism of Human Nature and Its Social Conditions", and traces the development on his views on the relationship between the individual and the collective with respect to the problem of human nature. Despite Durkheim's open despise for metaphysical theories of human nature, his sociological project clearly contains philosophical-anthropological content. It was Durkheim's intention to provide firm scientific sociological grounds for the dualistic conception of man. In his early oeuvre, Durkheim aims to explain the relation between the collective and the individual in human with his theory of solidarity. Unlike Ferdinand Toennies, Durkheim holds that their social evolution does not essentially change its substratum, since conditions of solidarity are the same for all societies whether they are based on mechanical or organic solidarity. However, the conception of organic solidarity contains several fundamental contradictions that make it unable to play the political role that Durkheim assigned to it and also drew extensive criticism in sociological theory. Eventually, Durkheim abandons this solution and his late work puts the experience of communion at the center of any collective life and describes the internal dynamics of this experience that fluctuates along with an unstable relationship between the collective and the individual within human being. Durkheim's anthropology can be regarded as a call for science that would be capable of developing the viewpoint suitable for analyzing this changing relationship, and this paper questions the potential of Durkheimian sociological project in fulfilling this task.

DE ethics; responsibility; guilt; imputation; consequentialism; causalism
AB The article discusses the issue of rethinking and clarifying of the concept of responsibility in the ethical legal discourse. Who do we call responsible? What are we responsible for and before whom? What is the essence and the basis of our responsibilities? The semantic field of the concept of responsibility is expanded in the article. The connection of responsibility with the concept of imputation demonstrates the need to define the subject of responsibility. An option of moral responsibility justification in terms of causal theories is considered. It is shown that the problems of determining of moral responsibility and imputation become apparent at the intersection of ethical and legal discourses. Imputation of guilt, especially in criminal law, requires not only the establishment of the subject, the perpetrator, but also the determination of his/her motives. The philosophically known problem connected with the impossibility of determining "alien consciousness" may well result in theoretical skepticism. In addition, if a motive is interpreted as a cause of action, there is an evident error in reasoning: a motive can be learnt from a description of action, but the way action is described already contains an indication of the motive which only requires finding. In civil law, on the contrary, the expansion of the concept of responsibility and virtual disappearance of the concept of guilt are observed. This fact leads to removal of the subject of moral responsibility. It seems that the main problem is to determine legal responsibility based on actions already committed. Consequentialism also assumes focus on a result. This shows certain difficulties of evidentiary support of the causal approach in the ethical legal environment and demonstrates the inapplicability of consequentialism as a basis for the formulation of universal moral principles.

AB The article presents the analysis of regional features of populist rhetoric realization as the basis of electorate mobilization. The motivational characteristics of electoral preferences are established, the strategy of populist policy in the Russian Federation is determined. The populist rhetoric defines policy as moral and ethical fight between the people and oligarchy. In electoral political space of modern Russia populism is considered in a negative connotation, it has manipulative impact on public consciousness of Russians, it forms political expectations and electoral preferences. In the analysis of regional electoral process it is necessary to consider a phenomenon of patronclient relations being a factor of electoral preferences which ensures the platform for forming the relations of domination, supremacy and subordination. In Russian electoral political space there are patriarchal, traditional, client-oriented, protest and marginal types of electoral behavior. The patriarchal (Republics of the North Caucasus, Siberia) and traditional (Saint Petersburg, Belgorod region) types create the conditions for populism use as it is easier for populists to win electorate of the senior generation which are committed to traditional values and customs.
   The political behavior of electorate is characterized by orientation to populist slogans of political leaders which are addressed to the axiological and emotional sphere. Expectations of the median Russian voter stipulate the tendency towards the perception of populism. The populist policy testifies to weakness of democratic institutes and deconsolidation of the public in an assessment of heuristic potential of populism. Populism in modern Russia is not articulated yet, and it does not represent complete ideology or the developed type of subjectivity. This phenomenon is often identified with the national will.

DE ancient pyrrhonism; sextus empiricus; skeptical investigation
AB Philosophy of Sextus Empiricus, the main representatives of ancient Pyrrhonism, suggests a definite way to the common goal for Hellenistic philosophers - happiness, which is understood by Sceptics as tranquility and peace of mind (ataraxia). At the bottom of this way lies a philosophical study on controversial issues about the nature of things. One can see the importance of the investigation for sceptical lifestyle by the name itself - the skeptics, that means investigators, inquisitors. However, a modern researcher G. Palmer cast doubt on the importance of the search for truth in Pyrrhonism and concluded that Sextus Empiricus is not interested in discovering the truth - which Palmer considers as a necessary condition of investigation. Therefore, the search is used only as a defence and a protection from accusations of negative dogmatism. K. Vogt criticizes this interpretation and suggests other premises of understanding the ancient concept of the search, which, in her opinion, were shared by the skeptics, for a better explaining of the Pyrrhonian philosophy. She puts forward as a condition a value of truth premise, according to which an essential quality for the philosophical search is not only the discovery of truth, but also the identification and avoidance of false beliefs. We suggest the following picture of skeptical investigation by developing the idea of K. Vogt, and showing the rootedness of the skeptical method in the ancient philosophical tradition (Gorgias, Socrates, Plato). Sextus defines it as a second-order investigation, it explores not the world, but is investigating the truth and falsity of beliefs, which pretend to apprehend the nature of things. The main opponents are not contemporaries of Sextus, but philosophers of the past. Every belief is investigated with a skeptical modes. A lack of justification of any belief becomes clear through investigation, if it is possible to oppose to him an equal convincing belief among the existing ones, or create one by means of modes. Thus, this procedure eliminates all came to the study untrustworthy beliefs, which may be false and therefore can lead to anxiety. This outcome - refraining from judgments about having equal persuasiveness beliefs - accident leads sceptic to ataraxia. At the same time there is a possibility of finding the truth, if a certain belief will be tested through modes, and will have an irresistible power of persuasion. Thus, a skeptical search satisfies the standard of investigation, that was already mentioned.

AB The article presents the main results of the research of interests and political orientations of student youth which was carried out in 2014 at the Kazan federal university and its branches in the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan. The choice of student youth as a reference group is caused by a number of factors, among which we should name the status of intellectual elite, social and political mobility that allows to consider students as the potential actors of socio-political transformations in the country. The data obtained during poll compared with the results of last research allow defining the dynamics of development of student youth's political sentiment in the region.
   The study of political attitudes, preferences of students was based on the identification of a number of indicators (degree of interest in politics, the level of personal involvement in political life) and on the study of factors that determine the motivation of political behavior of students.
   Empirical studies make it possible to rank the problems that dominate the political consciousness of students in the region. These include a high level of corruption in the government, inflation, rising prices, the state of health and education systems and the growing income inequality. Particular attention is accented on the problems associated with the foreign policy aspects, threats, aggression from abroad.
   The study showed that most young people's interest in politics is limited primarily by informational level, rarely they have desire to express their own position or judgments in political situations. The level of real political participation, socio-political activity of students is low. Obtained results let us notice the increasing trend of demonstration of protest behavior among certain part of the students.

DE understanding; projective semiosis; technical consciousness
AB Within the frame of general semiotics, understanding means a process of sign decoding. A sign is an entity of four components, including a material sign, a way of denoting as a place of this sign in the semiotic system or as its sense, an object of denoting as a sign meaning, and the condition of sign possibility as a subject's skill (interpretant). To understand some sign means to find the defining rule; since semiosis involves three types of rules (semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic), understanding can be defined as fixation of an object, a place in the system or an interpretation skill. Technology is treated as a projective way of consciousness work with signs, which consists in reversion of reception and leads to creation of new "meanings" while realizing semantic, syntactic and pragmatic rules at each level of cognition, whether it is sense perception, understanding (Verstand) or reason (Vernunft). Technical consciousness is considered within three levels. On the first level it is treated as "tradition" and technology is defined as unconscious activity complying with certain rules and providing survival in natural environment. On the second level it is treated as "the second nature" and technology is defined as the process of creation of something new, which is possible in case of matter control. It replaces natural environment with an artificial one. On the third level it is treated as "the third nature" and technology is the means of reflection control. Technical consciousness described as projective semiosis shows evolution of an individual from tradition to neomankind. After the birth, a human being masters the skills transmitted by cultural memory, which provides survival in natural habitat. Fantasy, fiction and metaphysical conception generated by astonishment, aesthetic experience or a practical problem provoke processes of self-comprehension and make it possible (indirectly) to see reflexive character of practical activity. The ability to create fictional objects in material substrates generates the second nature which replaces natural objects of perception and presentation. The ability to modify rules of reflection leads to deliberate and controlled self-evolution of a human being by means of creation of "the third nature", where a human being becomes a neohuman being who is capable of changing the quality of one's existence as a reflexive creature. Projective semiosis in the context of technology shows that the understanding as the ability to "do", as the material realization of the sense of a sign is determined not only by traditional receptive semiosis skills of communication and cognition, but also by matter control skills and embodiment skills.

AB The article explores the issue on the perception of the concept "national security" areas, models and methods of its maintenance by the population. The author uses materials of the sociological survey conducted by the Laboratory of problems of increasing the efficiency of state and municipal management of the South-Russian Institute of Management - branch of the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. The survey was carried out with the participation of leading experts in various aspects of national security, representing 27 Russian higher educational institutions and research centers in Moscow, Astrakhan, Barnaul, Belgorod, Dushanbe, Krasnodar, Nizhny Novgorod, Omsk, Pyatigorsk, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Syktyvkar, Sochi, Ufa.
   It is noted that as a priority political governance model that implements the basic concept of national security, respondents identified a democratic model.
   Most respondents believe that a unified security model in the Russian regions is ineffective, and such model should be developed taking into account the specificity of each subject. The study showed that the public's attention to the issue of national security is not sustainable, as determined by situational factors.
   It is proved that the motives of anxiety formed in the Russian public mind are not sustainable, and situational. Respondents see the economic cooperation more effective incentive to maintain national interests than by force. Estimation of the population of the priority issues of security shows that most respondents appreciate the organization of work to ensure the safety and anti-terrorism security in the sphere of national relations.
   The findings give grounds to assert that the focus of public attention to the problem of national security does not yet occupy the leading positions. To a greater extent, respondents focused on the issues of public safety, reducing threats and risks in their daily lives.
   Apparently, despite the external and internal attempts by certain forces to escalate the symptoms of military threats, economic and political instability, the state authorities have managed to maintain a stable situation on the ground and to instill confidence in the stability of the government itself.
   However, assessments of respondents showing pain points (as discussed above), on which the regional and federal authorities and the public should focus their attention.
   This should avoid focusing on minor topics objects, eliminate switching public attention on themes and subjects that do not require a real public outcry and do not carry the real threats to the individual, society and state.
   Thus, the problem of improving the state policy in the sphere of security exists objectively, and its resolution should be ensured not only by the professional power sector, deputies and representatives of the executive power, but also qualified experts from civil society and scientific environment.

AB In the article the analysis of problems in the field of political management in modern Russia is carried out. Initially, the author considers the possibility of explaining the nature of these problems through the theory of the "Resource curse", but it allows only updating the vulnerable areas of the system of political governance in our country, without identification of their nature. The author highlights such aspects of the current state of the political system of Russia, as ethno-federalism, its risks in modern conditions, state capitalism and examines its manifestations in the economy and politics of the country.
   From the author's point of view, the analyzed theory of "resource curse" cannot fully explain and solve the multidimensional problems of political management of modern Russia. There are deeper and more systematic characters than a statement about possession of hydrocarbon resources, the sale of which is in the ground budget replenishment. The attention is focused on the fact that one of the weak points in the political management of modern Russia is a decreased credibility and role of the Parliament, as well as the weak institutionalization of small and medium businesses. The factor causing destabilization of social relations and inefficiency of the system of state administration in the Russian Federation is an established model of ethno-federalism - "Matreshka". Such system of administrative and territorial structure of the country decreases the values of the statehood.
   The author highlights that the article largely reflects the positions of those political scientists who try to go beyond logical, but at the same time limited postulates of liberal theories when searching for a way out from difficult socio-political situation in the country. These concepts are ideologized and cannot escape the temptation of stigmatization of Russia as a country "cursed" by its natural resources.

TI The philosophy of science: A political turn
SO HERALD OF THE RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES

DT Article
AB Substantial changes in the philosophical comprehension of phenomena are usually called a turn; thus, we speak about the "Copernican turn," associated with the appearance of I. Kant's concept, in the context of the theory of knowledge or about the "linguistic turn," determined by the disclosure of the significant role of language in cognition. The author of the article published below is of the opinion that yet another area of philosophical knowledge, the philosophy of science, which is closest to the theory of knowledge, is also facing a turn today. This turn is political; i.e., this area of social life and culture, usually regarded as remote from political theory and practice, is undergoing politicization. Considerations about the prerequisites and content of this transformation are exceptionally topical not only for those who are somehow involved in the process of obtaining scientific knowledge but also for any member of modern society, which is unprecedentedly dependent on scientific-technological advance and related risks.

DT Article
DE river basin; landscape; operational-territorial unit; soil and gully
   erosion
AB This paper deals with main types of operational-territorial units used in the spatial analysis of slope erosion development. The analysis of the entire system of operational-territorial units used in the study of slope erosion processes in the plains of the temperate zone of the Earth, shows that a drainage (river) basin is an operational and territorial unit most suitable for this purpose. This is because of the fact that the basins are a geosystemic formation and reflect the specific nature of surface slope runoff, due to which a range of erosional processes occurs. An important feature of the basin approach is the simplicity in defining these units in the geographical space and the reasonable transition to other scale levels due to hierarchy feature of river basins. Their limited use is associated with the landscape specifics of the terrain: such as ice and arid zones of the Earth. We have electronically mapped the territory of lowland and upland landscapes of the eastern part of the Russian Plain with total area of 150,000 km(2) by defining the boundaries of 3,331 basins used in the analysis of soil and gully natural-artificial erosion. Other types of operational-territorial units such as the regular geometric grids, the political-administrative division, and sample characteristics can be used for collection of data geobank but poorly suited for identification of erosion patterns. Landscape territorial units allow performing a stiffly accurate spatial analysis of erosion and its determining factors. The factor limiting their use is the complexity of landscapes defining, lack of their internationally standardized taxonomy and poor cartographic exploration of the territory at regional and local generalization levels.

AB In the context of joining events (previous and further ones) of the Crimea to the Russian Federation the analysis of Russian domestic and international political processes is given. Joining Ukrainian Crimea to Russia as a subject of the federation it was confirmed by the decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin's March 21, 2014. Incorporation of the Republic of Crimea to the Russian Federation was postulated by the results of a national referendum in the Crimea. One of the reasons for the active support Russia in this process has been deterministic primarily foreign factors. On the issue of energy supplies to the European countries Russia has long relied on political support for the regime of ousted President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych. In the research new political steps of Russia in construction of a new area on territories controlled earlier by V. Yanukovych administration are considered. Ukraine's new government, as well as the international community, speaking with one voice with respect to the non-recognition of annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea to Russia. The scenario of Russian political actions on new developing territories is discovered. The logic of Ukraine, which lost part of its territory as payment for forced regime change, expressed in the conformist narrowcasting confrontation with Russia. Western countries on this issue are going on, removing itself the role of maintaining the status quo of state borders and the types of political regimes. An identification attempt of the subject of politics which actions were the result of a new is given. Western leaders stressed personal responsibility of the head of state Vladimir Putin in the process of accession of the Republic of Crimea to the Russian Federation.

AB Current political climate is unfavorable for setting up broad international programs aimed at risk assessment and threat control in the field of biosecurity. At the same time, spread of emerging and re-emerging diseases, development of sophisticated antibiotic resistance mechanisms, grown threat of bioterrorism, and loss of disease control due to ecological damage and globalization dictate the urgent development of a national biosecurity program capable to address these risks and threats. Although Russian Federation is technologically and methodologically adept in the field of epidemiological and medical control of biological select agents, the expertise in latest technologies of treatment, prevention, and detection of potential biohazards is lagging. There is an urgent need for updating of state biosecurity programs, especially in the field of new vaccines and biologicals development for control and prevention of hazardous infections. Key elements of these programs include: well-justified list of priority targets and technologies; list of highest risk infectious agents to be addressed in development of countermeasures; identification of most efficient countermeasures for each agent of concern; selection of the most appropriate partnership model for scientific collaboration and formation of multidisciplinary teams, as well as for cooperation between science and biotech industry. The latter is particularly important for prompt conversion of scientific findings into solid technologies and prospective drug and vaccine candidates. By combining state funding and infrastructure with growing competence of Russian biotech and pharma industry, the likelihood of successful implementation of biosecurity programs will increase significantly. Strong aspects of Russian microbiological programs, such as development of anti-infective vaccines and bacteriophages, should be exploited in full. Despite current political turbulence, it is necessary to note that combined effort of various countries is required to protect the world population from risks of the globalization-fueled infectious diseases and bioterrorism threats emergence. Pathogens neglect borders and political issues, whereas poor coordination and collaboration at the international level can result in significant social and economic losses globally. Success in development and implementation of national biosecurity program in Russia based on the state-of-art scientific and technical achievements will help initiate a true international cooperation in biosafety/biosecurity area.

DE NAFTA; economic integration; free trade; North America; USA; Canada;
   Mexico
AB 2014 marked the 20th anniversary of the entry into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which created the world's largest free trade area. Now it links 470 million people producing more than 19 Trillion US$ worth of goods and services. The article addresses five issues: the international importance of NAFTA; the economic transformation that has occurred in the USA, Canada and Mexico since the advent of the NAFTA; a "thought experiment" on what American, Canadian and Mexican performance might have been without the NAFTA; the detrimental effect of 9/11 on the North American economic integration; and what's next? At the time of its signing, NAFTA in many ways was considered a "gold standard" in terms of international free trade agreements. For the first time ever a free trade agreement brought together both developed and developing countries. It also broadened the scope of traditional FTAs by embracing services, foreign investments and property rights, and recognized the importance of workers' and environmental rights and issues. In terms of trade and investment NAFTA has been an undisputed success. Canada ranks as the United States' largest export market, while Mexico is its second-largest export market. Today - thanks to NAFTA - North Americans not only sell more goods to one another, they also make more things together. For every dollar of goods that Canada and Mexico export to the USA, there are 25 cents' worth of US inputs into Canadian goods and 40 cents' worth into Mexican ones. Regardless of the impressive economic record, NAFTA has its critics. The agreement has not underwent a major update since its inception in 1994, i.e. prior to the rise of electronic commerce and, digital services, advanced manufacturing and many other innovative features of the global economy. As far as there is no political appetite to update NAFTA directly, indirect route is a subject of wide speculation. Canada, the USA and Mexico are negotiating partners to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and any benefits conferred by the TPP that go further than NAFTA would take precedence. It is assumed that the TPP should help to modernize NAFTA commitments and upgrade the North American trade and investment.

AB The author challenges the accepted view that the 88 BC plebeian tribune P. Sulpicius' bills brought him to confl ict with the Senate and were backed up by the equites whose interests he defended. In the author's opinion, most senators were relatively well disposed to Sulpicius' drafts, while the equites were not his main supporters: they supported him inasmuch as they were connected with the patres favourably disposed to the reformer. Following E. Badian, the author considers the data on the so-called Antisenatus to be unreliable and those on his law limiting senators' debts to 2000 denarii to be out of context and ambiguous (these data being the most usual proofs of the mutual hostility of the Senate and Sulpicius). Nor could the bill on accepting the cives novi to all the 35 tribes have caused the senators' strong disapproval, as it was just a continuation of the laws of 90-89 BC promoting rights of the Italians. The senators who opposed the tribune's bills most of all were the consuls Sulla and Pompeius Rufus. Their opposition caused the interference of the army, thus launching the civil war.

AB The paper thoroughly examines the ideological essence, political goals, structure, electoral achievements and international protest activities of the Pirate Movement, consisting of national Pirate Parties worldwide and the Pirate Parties International. The Pirate ideology arose in mid-2000s in response to information society biases, and is paying special attention to the freedom of non-commercial information exchange in the Internet, individual privacy, transparency of state politics and direct citizens' involvement with flexible Internet-tools (Liquid Democracy concept). This relatively new political force has made a vivid progress in electoral field within a short time (since 2006 till present). The representatives of the most successful Pirate Parties (in Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Spain, Croatia and Iceland) hold deputy's seats in municipal, regional, national and supranational state agencies, including the European Parliament. In many other countries of the world the "Pirates" are also registered officially and participate in elections; in some countries the Pirate Parties are active, though not yet registered. Except for electoral activity, the Pirate Parties organize joint protest campaigns against national laws/state programs and international agreements that violate the information freedom and civil rights (f.e. PRISM, ACTA). These campaigns also serve for unification and growth of the international Pirate Movement. The Pirate Parties have quickly transformed from populist groups into a political force aspiring to equitable participation in political process along with traditional political parties, challenging them in a certain way. The Pirate ideology will be in demand as long as it will give a resultative solution for specific problems of a post-industrial society in the context of democracy.

DT Article
DE foreign direct investment; second citizenship; foreign residence;
   real-estate; geography of business; homeowners; resort property
AB The article considers the main features of foreign investments of the Russians who have dual citizenship and/or foreign residence permit. The main task is to find out the reasons for obtaining the second passport by the businessmen and the representatives of the Russian middle-class. The author points that the majority of the businessmen has the largest part of their assets in Russia. Also, their assets may be registered in offshore jurisdictions other than the countries of the second citizenship. As for the countries of dual citizenship, there are usually second-rate assets' allocations of two categories: (1) required for citizenship-by-investment programs and (2) invested into the real-estate or ready-made business (for example, into the leading hi-tech companies supplying their products to the Russian Federation). Therefore, business reasons cannot be considered as the principal motivation for acquiring the second citizenship. The more specific reasons may differ. Firstly, many Russian businessmen moved abroad during 1990-s in order to avoid the political turbulence. Secondly, some businessmen used their original foreign citizenship for developing business in Russia. Generally, foreign citizenship has been regarded by all businessmen as a certain precaution from the pressures from the local law enforcement bodies and as a driver of business contacts due to visa-free travelling. The article also covers the foreign investment activities of those ordinary Russian citizens who buy real-estate in foreign countries in order to acquire a residence permit. An analysis of the available data of foreign real-estate agencies and migration services is undertaken. It is concluded that most of middle-class Russians buy real-estate abroad not with aim to emigrate from Russia but to acquire a place for spending vacations and, to a lesser extent, to live after retirement.

DE reader-response criticism; theory of tradition; history of literature;
   ontology of art
AB The analysis and conceptualization of Hans Robert Jauss' reader-response criticism's methodologies is of particular interest and significance for eliciting literary tradition's determination and development principles as well as defining the ontological status of art. Serving as the theories base, the dialectic relations between the text and its recipient, who acts as the conception's central methodological construct, provides understanding of a literary texts' perception and comprehension through the model of a dialogue. Since a literary text can be repeatedly perceived in the historical perspective, its relevance and interpretation can undergo many modifications from the point of view of changing aesthetical attitudes. Consequently, the reoccurring relevance of a literary text and the gradual adaptation of its semantic potential can be described as a procedural continuum in historically successive acts of perception. The principle liability of literary texts to subsequent receptions and reinterpretations presupposes the existence of a certain context that provides the transsubjective perception and effect of the text and makes it open to continuous interpretation. In H.R. Jauss' aesthetic system this function is performed by the "horizon of expectations" - an a priori knowledge of the perceiving public that is based on the previously acquired literary or life experience that makes the perception and understanding of the text as well as its comparison to other texts possible. Thus it's the procedural aesthetic perception which presupposes interpretational variability and the mobility of relevance of literary texts that constitutes the general literary tradition as well as its persistent historical formation. Reader-response criticism also accounts for productive relations between literary texts. According to the theory, each literary work that brings up a certain formal or semantic problem leaves a variety of possible solutions that can be developed by the following works of literature. This process of producing new texts on the basis of existing literary experience is the cause of the consequent "transformation of the horizon of expectations" and the general literary traditions' dynamic and development. Thus the procedural aesthetic perception of literary works helps establish the event and immanent connections in the history of literature as well as the variable and fixed factors in the dynamic of the literary process.

DE fact; conceptual carcass; transcendences; language game; subject of
   study
AB In the article the fact study is based on the theory that the fact itself is a result of interaction of a subject under study with an object and has a structure, which is considered as by the current theories so as by the peculiarities of the studied object, constructing the conceptual schemes mainly anew. The transcendental nature of the fact, as well as its perception, is determined by two aspects : ontological and epistemological. First, obviously or not, there exist a pointer (related as a part and the whole) on the endless stream of some fact variants, which are actualized from time to time and have some particular prime cause. Second, any fact model is a phenomenon, which doesn't exist by itself, but lives as a unique link of a chain and so on. Thus, the syncretic act namely, which actualizes for "me" reality of the specific situation (the fact) has transcendental nature. The syncretic nature of the institutionalization act is also determined by the fact that actual sensations as well as actual reflexing can be possible only in case of "me" previous experience. Thus, for example, it is obvious that transcendence factor constituting a world/ fact model in planimetry paradigm actualized the concept of plane, but not the concept of space. In the aspect of problem of conceptual carcasses modeling study it is revealed that one and the same theory having been changed against its perception and handling (because of the studied subject pragmatic presupposition changing) demonstrates the reality of the lack (backbone) criteria. So, the following can be stated : the transcendence of fact can structure conceptual carcasses in a particular way, like it is possible and necessary in the context of some concrete paradigm actual for a collective subject of study.

DE Myth; Epos; Logos; mythological consciousness
AB This article is issued to a question of finding appropriate methodological principles of myth analysis in philosophy. 'Mythic' is an ambivalent dynamic phenomenon of culture and a structural unit of consciousness and self-consciousness experience. The strategy of distinctionism placed as methodological basis of thematic fronting of myth; it combines post-metaphysical modifications of phenomenology, hermeneutics and semiotics. How to define 'Mith' in a variety of theoretical models? What is a specificity of significant potentialities that differs 'Mith', 'analytical Logos' and 'narrative Epos'? Was a 'mith to logos' conversion definitive in a western culture? The Mith in the article is designed as an ontological structure of consciousness experience and as a transcendental imagination, that is used to open a 'prototype of existence' and generate formers of every practice of interpretation of objective reality. Logos is considered as a principle of analytic and objectified thinking in the article, whereas epos is considered as a narrative structure of understanding. Myth and logos are interact and cooperate, dynamic and complementary principles of understanding, not static categories. It caused (some) difficulties of identification and explanation of nature and functions of myth. A mythological consciousness is neither a rudiment of primitive phase of phylogenetic development of consciousness, nor a chaotic or irrational production of images. The mythological consciousness is specified first of all by syncretism, involvement of propositional, normative and expressive meanings of experience. At the second place it is also specified by undifferentiated phenomena of contemplation, experience and thinking, that are united in speech and actions. And at the third place it's specified by absence of critical-reflexive position towards these elements of experience. As an experience of understanding and a fact, 'Myth' couldn't be reduced to 'Mythology' as a systematization of narratively arranged myths. Different levels of mythological discourse and thinking, processes of demythologization and remythologization are closely connected with epos and logos. Considering the 'myth to logos' conversion shows that acts of these images of nous are ways of verbalization, thinking, understanding and arranging the experience of consciousness.

DE Sweden; Riksdag; the Social Democratic Party; the Sweden Democrats;
   right-centre; the formation of the government; Riksdag budget vote;
   Parliamentary deadlock; snap election; December agreement
AB This publication is a kind of afterword to the previous article by the same author, printed in MEMO Journal, 2015, no. 2. The article was received by the editorial board in October 2014. The afterword was caused by extraordinary events in the Swedish politics in December 2014. In the Riksdag in early December, the government lost a vote on the budget, due to the Swedish Democrats voting in favour of the centre-right opposition proposal. In return, the government announced snap elections for March 22nd, 2015, which officially were supposed to be confirmed on 29th December. The most likely outcome of these elections would have been a recurrence of the main result of the September elections, that is, the position of the Swedish Democrats as kingmaker. To avoid dependence on the Swedish Democrats, on December 27th, the government parties and the centre-right opposition signed an agreement that made it possible for a minority government to get its own budget approved. Thus, the agreement brought the country out of parliamentary deadlock and enabled her to regain control, but deprived the Swedish Democrats of the effectiveness of voting and by that ignored the will of their electorate. In Sweden, the agreement was given the opposite evaluations. Despite being tactically effective, the agreement has not solved the problem of the Swedish Democrats and especially anti-immigration sentiments in the society that the party reflects. The deal of the government and the centre-right opposition is a political-technological solution to this problem, whereas there needs to be found a political one. A dialogue between the parties of the establishment with the Swedish Democrats is needed, leading to some compromise. Probably, for the first time since the 1930's, the Swedish establishment has begun to lose its appreciation of the necessity for political compromise. However, some signs of understanding the necessity of reforming immigration policy are already visible; this is evidenced by the statements of a number of establishment politicians.

AB The article explores practices of the regional development policy in Spain (in other words, regional policy) as the central government's regulation of economic and territorial development, with a view to their possible efficiency for the Russian Federation. The author singles out Spanish regions (17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities) and local communities (provinces, municipalities and islands) as objects of the regional development policy, reviews goals and objectives of this policy. The paper focuses on analyzing, particularizing and comparing of instruments and mechanism relevant to this policy line of the Spanish state, its institutional and political aspects in time of Franco's rule and during the post-Francoist period. The variation of economic development in the regions of Spain, different parameters of this variation and some factors of the autonomous communities' economic development are estimated. The specific character of interrelationship between central, regional and local authorities in the context of the Spanish State of Autonomies and of the territorial development dynamics, the peculiarities of the operational interbudgetary relations model, problems of the local government and self-government as well as of decentralization of metro- and megapolises' governance are examined. The questions of public discussions in Spanish society about the outcome and efficiency of the central government's regional development policy are touched upon. The regional development policy in Spain is considered as extremely politicized, semistructured, contentious and ambiguous in consequence of the legal and socio-economic asymmetry of the autonomous communities and also of the ongoing process of federalization in Spain. As in recent years Spain is steadily losing its previous status of the subsidized territory and is turning into a donor of the European Union regional policy, it is necessary for Spanish authorities to make the regional development policy more active and to take a different view of its objectives and opportunities.

AB The paper presents an analytical review of the conference held in the All-Russian State Library for Foreign Literature (November, 2014). It deals with deep historical and socio-cultural roots of the present-day religious dynamics of India, including its main political implications. The wide methodological principle of correlation between India's socio-cultural background and the current state of affairs in Hinduism is denoted as Indo-logics. The paper also deals with bilateral processes of internal consolidation of Hinduism within the Republic of India as well as of the gradual transformation process of Hinduism into one of the biggest religions on international scale. Both sides of these phenomena are analysed in connection with ambivalent processes of the Indian inner modernization during the 19th-21st centuries, and also with general global socioeconomic and intellectual trends of the current history, including mass migrations, the expansion of mass media, deep crisis of the present-day semi-industrial modes of school and university education, etc. The article draws special attention to problems of Indian subaltern strata in the present-day Indian religious dynamics, including the "neo-Buddhist renaissance" and Christian conversions among Indian "untouchables".

DE France; social policy; welfare state; social insurance; pension system;
   labor legislation; reforms; globalization; European integration
AB The configuration French welfare state is determined by a mix of factors. Historically, the nation's social insurance system is based on the principles of solidarity, social protection, collective efforts and government's responsibility. To a large extent this explains its paternalistic features. The French social model has a complex institutional structure and consists of different insurance schemes which are highly segmented according to the professions and industries, to belonging to the private or public sectors. The article deals with the theoretical framework, specifics of the development and modernization of French social model, its adaptation to the most recent economic changes triggered by the processes of globalization and European integration. The French welfare state's transformations are necessitated by domestic and external economic, social and political challenges. The financing of the system is largely based on Bismarkian principle, namely, the bulk of social contributions are traditionally assumed by the firms along with the workers themselves. But it is mixed with a dose of Beveridgian society with its wide solidarity via general taxation. The author focuses on the welfare policy and legislation framework according to its model and type of regime. The analysis of the reform's process reveals the specifics of the weaknesses of French model which still faces contradictions between dirigist and market approaches in resolving social problems, between the aims of economic effectiveness and social protection. Successive reforms of the social protection system towards reductions of state social expenditures and privatization of pensions will help France to recalibrate its welfare model in accordance with a new logic at the European level and its mainstream in social policy.

AB The main objective of weberianism is to update legacy of Max Weber, while maintaining the authenticity and integrity of the work a classic. One such problem is the search for the meaning of action actors and the formation of the corresponding logical categories and concepts. The main task of sociology, according to Weber, is that the level of scientific knowledge to understand and interpret the causal meaning that individuals invest in their actions on the everyday level in terms of the cultural significance of their actions and historical specificity. Preliminary reconstruction of semantic form and content of everyday life and existing social structures is a prerequisite for a preliminary empirical work, and such work can only "under certain circumstances, find social action that is important for understanding and explaining the relationship. On the basis of everyday experience, a sociologist trying to understand and explain the cause of social reality in which it is placed in its cultural uniqueness. As part of the science of reality, there is a search theoretically designed, typical, empirically provable regular leaks of human actions that produce and reproduce social institutions. Methodological views of Max Weber, in which meaning serves as an integrative module between ordinary and scientific knowledge can be represented in the following sequence: 1) study of semantic relations actors, including ordinary understanding of motivation, picture of the world and living conditions; 2) the scientific understanding of the intended meaning of the researcher actor, including analysis of the concepts and their relationships, specification of ideal types, the explanation of the causal relationships using goal-rational hypotheses, ideal types and concepts; 3) a causal explanation of a particular social phenomenon or a historical event with the ideal-typical concepts. Thus, the category washed acts as the major integrative module everyday and scientific knowledge. In this case, at the ordinary and scientific levels can be considered as the very category of meaning and understanding of the category. Within the framework of Weber's empirical understanding sociology should take into consideration the subjective and objective, rational and irrational. In its universal historical studies of religion, economics, and other types of domination. Weber argues persuasively productivity of its methodology, based on an understanding of the meaning of social action.

Its heuristic potential is confirmed by numerous studies demonstrating the positive impact of the level and types of social capital on a wide range of economic, social and political phenomena, and especially the use of the concept of social capital to study economic growth and development issues. However, there is no universally accepted definition of social capital, and there is no unanimous opinion concerning the ways of measuring it. The paper contains a review of the current status of the theoretical field of the concept; it shows that researchers from different countries are interested in the impact of social capital on economic growth and development at the regional level. Specific comparative studies in different countries and regions strongly support the presence of a correlation that proves social capital is one of the powerful driving forces of development. However, since the majority of studies on the effects of social capital on economic development are concentrated in the developed countries of Western Europe and the USA, it is important to evaluate the potential of this approach in the countries of post-Communist development that have different experience, in particular, in Russia. In this regard, the article points out that there is a clear lack of such studies with regard to Russia's regions, where there are only occasional fragmentary attempts to study social capital. The aim of the paper is to substantiate on the theoretical basis and to indicate the prerequisites for empirical studies on the effects of social capital of regions on their economic growth and development, especially under the conditions of the general economic and structural crisis.

AB This paper is devoted to the research of the history of participation Benenson and Golitsyn in the formation of financial and industrial group Russian-British bank in the Russian Empire. It is necessary to emphasize, that in the beginning of the 20 century joint-stock companies have occupied a prevailing situation in the main industrial and financial spheres of the Russian economy already. The densities of production, made by them, was dominant in many industries, making 70-80%, and sometimes more. The formation and successful operation of the integrated companies and, above all, financial and industrial structures (groups) is undoubtedly the most important factor in improving the efficiency and sustained growth in industrial production. The analysis of participation of G. Benenson and A. Golitsyn in the activity of the Russian-English bank and joint-stock company allows to reveal most important for leading branches of the Russian economy institutional parameters of industrial business in the beginning of the 20 century, including: a) Larger or smaller independence owners in those or other kinds of enterprise activity; b) Availability business and socio-cultural connections among other businessmen; c) Efficiency to achieve a balance of individual and group interests; d) A management of the firms having more open (joint-stock structures), or closed (share structures), kind of activity. The process of the company involving in the financial-industrial groups had, sometimes, inconsistent contents, was exposed to influence both positive, and negative economic, sociocultural and political factors (economic crisises, revolution, wars, ethnic and religious conflicts etc.). However general tendency in the development of a integrated component of the Russian business carried in the beginning of the 20 century in the whole favorable orientation, potentially promoting large changes in socio economic structure of the Russian society in this period.

DE migration behavior; power discourse; social and political discourse
AB In the article the author attempts to identify participants and reveal the meaning of power discourse and social and political discourse in the frame of factors and conditions of forming migration behaviour of the peasantry of Russia in the post-reform period. It is evident that the problem of the formation of migration behavior of the Russian peasantry as an important phase to join in the resettlement process, was being adjusted for a long time within the coordinate system of the positivism methodology. As a result, the reflection of the migration movement to Siberia, circumstances of structuring migration intentions and migration behaviour of the rural population, was carried out either with an emphasis on the idea unmotivated mobility of the peasantry, "the tendency to vagabondage", or on economic failure of peasant households. The method of deconstructing discourses, based on the detection of its recipients and the senders, the circumstances and conditions of creating texts, allowed to detect new distinctions of understanding the reasons for migration behaviour of the most mass social layer in the Russian Empire. The study showed a lack of direct correlation between the peasant shortage of land and migration activity. It was proved that "the motive of vagabondage" was originally replicated in publicism and later became widespread in power discourse in order to regulate mass character of the resettlement process. The shift of the emphasis of discourse towards understanding the logic of peasant behavior, implementing through the organization of economic activity, predetermined the fundamental "reset" in the views of the authorities and society on the migration behaviour of farmers and the resettlement process. At the turn of XIX-XX centuries, the centre of the agricultural situation in the country was increasingly the issues associated with higher migration intentions in the peasant rural. With population growth, migration, with legislation registration and circular practices, the intonation and meaning of social and political discourse and power discourse changed. Migration activity of the peasantry in journalistic articles, materials of clerical nature was regarded as the response of the peasantry to the manifestation of the crisis in the agricultural and environmental sector. The authority were confident that the solution of the agrarian issue was possible with the help of palliative means of self-resourceful character (agricultural fields), and it meant the understanding of the importance and relevance of the organization of the resettlement case. The emotional stress of the discourse, linguistic structures which were used, the reading of the discourse through the modern achievements of the human sciences, especially by means of social psychology, provide a unique opportunity to identify a human being as a carrier of migration attitude due to schematic context of the economic grounds of his actions and social behavior.

DT Article
DE the British; technical cooperation; the Urals; English-Russian relations
AB This article studies one aspect of British-Russian cooperation between the 1840s and 1850s, involving the exchange of technical staff. The research is based on clerical records and act sources, deposited in archival materials of central and local governmental bodies of the Russian mining industry. The specific features of cooperation are illustrated by examples of service of Englishmen at Ural factories. The author analyses circumstances of recruitment and conditions of work of high-qualified engineers as well as of ordinary masters. During the period in question, Englishmen were the most requested specialists because they were thought to possess advanced technological experience and knowledge. Such a perception extended to all, not just to the representatives of professions requiring the highest education and qualification. In the second half of the 1840s - early 1850s, a team of shipbuilders led by the engineer, James Carr, worked in the Ural plants. During this period the Russian government actively invited mechanics, hammer workers, molders and masters of puddling. Englishmen often were appointed to higher positions to deal with the technical part of Ural state factories. The exchange of experience was carried out during the common work of British and Russian engineers and masters as well as in the process of training. The paper displays the ambiguity of such interaction and difficulties, which arose due to faults of either one or the other side. The sources, documenting recruitment and dismissal of foreigners, describe cases when the hiring of invited specialists did not bring the expected results. The author reveals the reasons and consequences of failed attempts of using British technological experience at Russian plants. Among them include technical unpreparedness of the Ural industry, the inconsistency between the qualification of foreigners and the tasks for which they were invited and finally insufficient awareness of the Russian side concerning the recruited technicians' professional skills. Biographies of English specialists (engineers, mechanics, etc.) are considered in the context of international conjuncture, which at the time was characterized by an increase in tension in English-Russian relations and the upcoming war. The paper demonstrates that the attitude of some British men towards their service in the Urals changed for the worse because the Crimean war had begun. Others continued their contract work in the Urals in spite of the military confrontation between Russia and England. The activity of British technical specialists in the Urals was a reflection of peculiarities in English-Russian relations, in which cooperation in economic and technological spheres could coexist with a drastic deterioration of political relations.

DE perestroika; democracy; authoritarianism; reformation of the Russian
   society; logistics of perestroika; new political thinking
AB A "round table" devoted to the 30th anniversary of perestroika (1985-1991) was held in the Department of analysis of socio-political processes of the Institute of Sociology, RAS in May 2015. The researchers of the Department (Yu. Krasin, A. Galkin, A. Veber, F. Kuriukin, L. Nikovskaya, V. Pantin, I. Yazhborovskaya and others) took part in the discussion. This article tries to comprehend the approaches revealed by the exchange of opinions. Glance at the perestroika from the present convinces that despite sharp criticism, it stays in the memory of millions as one of the few landmarks considered to be "a moment of truth" in Russian history. A remote time distance gives us possibility to perceive the meaning of perestroika more clearly, to identify its place in the chain of historical events of our epoch. Perestroika was a purposeful movement; its goals were humanistic and were met by means of their achievement. The logistic conception worked out on this basis, in spite of its problems and omissions, outlined the contours of transition to a contemporary democratic society. This feature positively distinguishes perestroika from the next stages of the Russian reformation. When enumerating holes and mistakes of perestroika, one should remember that it was interrupted on its liftoff; its purpose was never fully achieved. The future destiny of the Russian reformation depends on whether this process would be directed in the channel of evolutionary democratization of state and society. The main nexuses and factors of the democratization, as one can see them today, are: breakthrough to the innovative type of development, demanding the rise of role and prestige of science; "cultivation" and professionalization of the state; broadening of functions of the civil society, involving it into the space of power relations. Hope and chance for successful completion of the democratic reformation of society, which was initiated 30 years ago by the perestroika, are closely connected with uncoupling of these nexuses.

AB This study develops a methodological tool for integration of research on party system fragmentation and party system nationalization. The method is built by decomposing a standard indicator of fragmentation, the effective number of parties, into individual-party components (effective size scores), and weighting them by nationalization scores, which allows for disaggregating the number of parties into two distinct components, the effective numbers of national and regional parties. As a result, it becomes possible to assess the influences of substantively important factors upon the components of the number of parties and the overall level of fragmentation in a methodologically consistent, quantifiable way. In addition, the proposed framework of analysis differentiates between direct and indirect effects upon party system fragmentation. A preliminary empirical test on a sample from 90 countries demonstrates that the proposed framework for analysis allows for achieving a rich and nuanced understanding of the factors of party system fragmentation.

AB The author of the retort critically analyses a new version of patriotic rhetoric, which is revolving around the conception of the "Russian idea" and based on quite arbitrary interpretation of the Alexis de Tocqueville's philosophic heritage. A. Savoysky by opposing the Tocqueville's political philosophy to various 'vituperators of Russia' of the kind of Astolphe de Custine tries in vain to persuade the Russian scientific community that both the reputation of the great French thinker is 'rehabilitated' and 'all the Russian people' is 'delivered' from the charge of its bent for slavery as a result of his own 'reconstruction' of the original meaning and 'ideological orientation' of the famous juxtaposition of the USA and the imperial Russia in the end of the first volume of the book "On the Democracy in America". The author believes, on the contrary, the Savoysky's attempt to substitute the notion 'servitude' for the word 'ministration' in the corresponding passage of the book is at variance with both the philosophic sense of the dichotomy 'liberty/slavery' by which A. de Tocqueville characterizes the contradictions of the European political thought in the epoch of modern and the elementary linguistic and cultural norms of perception of the notion 'servitude' in French language and mentality.

AB The authors analyze some actual socio-political implications of the contemporary process of the broad recognition and expansion of global academic and scientometric ratings, as well as their impact on the state policy in the scientific and educational fields in the Russian Federation. The authors introduce the concept "charts power" as an important component of "soft power" of nation-states and international institutions for the most popular global academic and scientometric ratings can be used as an economic and foreign policy weapon. The article considers the leading academic ratings (Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities, Higher Education Index and QS World University Ranking) and the key scietometric ratings (Web of Science and Scopus). The authors believe that the charts power of other countries represents a real and potential threat for the national security of the Russian Federation, and provide some recommendations to mitigate the challenges, for instance, to create and promote (in due course internationally) a comparative index of trust to the international ratings including academic ones.

AB The article is a new link in a series of publications devoted to the analysis of empirical data obtained in the inter-regional survey conducted by the Institute of Socio-Political Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences in cooperation with the Moscow Institute of Socio-Cultural Programs. Veterans of the Great Patriotic War were the main object of the study as having certain attitudes and beliefs, worldview and value orientations. The survey was conducted in different regions of Russia including Moscow, Saint Petersburg, regions and republics of the European Russia, the Caucasus, and Siberia. Among other questions, the authors reveal the veterans' attitude to the events of the war itself (comparative evaluation of the combat capability of the Red Army and the army of Nazi Germany, the factors that influenced the course of the war, the relationships with the commanding staff, etc.). The authors undertake a detailed analysis of the socio-demographic characteristics of the veterans, their typical biographical trajectories during the war, religious beliefs and its changes in the life course. The article pays special attention to the questions asking veterans to assess their current social and financial situation, the availability of cultural facilities, the attitudes towards them from the state in different periods of post-war Russian history up to the present day.

TI Machiavelli and the Problem of Political Morality
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE political morality; moralism; political realism; violence;
   perspectivism; conflict; Machiavelli
AB The idea of political morality arises as an attempt to overcome a theoretically sterile (or "cheap," to use Niklas Luhmann's idiom) opposition between political moralism as a projection of "universal morality" onto politics and so-called political realism, which denies any ethical dimension of politics. The paper explores different approaches to political morality. The author points out the deficiency of approaches that reduce political morality to the recognition of the necessity to use morally reprehensible means (in some "extraordinary situations") and to the attendant moral qualms and scruples of those politicians who find it necessary to resort to them.
   An alternative approach to political morality unveils it as a set of ethical (as distinguished from "technical") orientations and competencies, which emanate from the very practice of politics, from what Machiavelli referred to as "necessita." Such orientations and competencies are not necessarily related either to the virtuousness of the participants in politics or to its determinateness by any "higher objectives" that politics supposedly serves or is meant to serve. In the concluding section of this paper, three pivotal "principles" of political morality thus understood are adumbrated, namely, the economy of violence, perspectivism, and a quest for alternatives, that is, to use Machiavelli's terms, for a method to "recast everything a new."

DE monopolization; concentration; marxism; imperialism; socialization
AB The article analyses the problem of monopolization from the Marxist point of view which is worked out by the representatives of Marxist school - from the founders to the Soviet school of Marxism. Monopolization is considered an objective phenomenon for the modern economy which naturally originates from free market. It is proved by statistics. This process has dual nature. On the one hand, it promotes labor productivity, and on the other hand - it holds some risks which are connected with taking economic and political power by monopoly capital. The way out from this dilemma is seen in socialization of monopolies which will put them under supervision of the whole society because it is determined by the evolution of the economy, influenced by aggressive concentration.

DE Russian Federation; economic crisis; economic resilience; gross regional

AB Consequences of resent economic crises and economic resilience of administrative territorial units of Russia are considered. We define resilience as the ability of a regional economy to withstand, absorb or overcome internal or external economic shock. We have chosen to use the gross regional product, employment rate and percent of population with incomes lower then living wage as primary indicators of resilience. All territories are divided into four types in accordance with their ability to withstand shock or recover from initial decline. A number of factors that may be associated with observed levels of resilience: sectoral composition and export-orientation of regional economies, urbanization level, and availability of adaptive workforce with higher levels of skills and qualification, is considered. The findings can support policy-makers at different administrative levels in making the economic structures in Russian Federation and its regions more resilient to economic crises and a sudden economic downturn.

AB The aim of the research is to solve the problem that experienced the inconsistency of Russian post-reform law, science and legal practice the evidential powers of defense counsel in criminal proceedings which are defined by one rules of the law and denied by the other at the same time.
   Its methodology included both the general scientific methods and the specific juridical methods of cognition.
   The main results of the research include the original understanding of the evidential powers of defense counsel in criminal proceedings and the reasons why they are legally fixed with fundamental contradictions. It's affirmed that though reforms in Russia made an impulse to the development of criminal procedure legislature, science and education they didn't modify the practice. The literature on this issue reflects two contradictive scientific approaches towards the problem not fully appreciated by practitioners. To justify that this situation can be corrected only by cooperation of theory and practice, authors make a review of scientific points of view and refer to the unique for Russia judicial precedent (Judgment made by the Kursk Regional Court on Case file # 2-4-06) when court applied the theoretical opinion on advocate's power to gather and form evidence. Finally, the proposals for the Russian criminal procedure law amendment are expounded and an agenda for future research is discussed.
   The results of the research make a new basis for the further criminal justice studies and can be used in correcting the inconsistency of Russian criminal procedure legislation and in establishing the adequate level of partnership between theory and practice institutions in solving the criminal procedure problems.

DT Article
DE History of Childhood; Stalinism; Political Repressions; Great Purge;
   Diaries; Soviet Man; Victims of Terror; Soviet Utopia
AB Based on the analysis of the diaries of two Soviet teenagers whose parents were victims of Stalinist repressions, this essay attempts to evaluate how the authors of the diaries processed their traumatic experiences and to what extent these experiences affected their identity. Central to this process is, of course, the phenomenon of omission. Nevertheless, the conflict between the official Soviet worldview and the teenagers' personal experiences could not be resolved purely through omission. In the diaries the authors craft a distinction between their personal, intimate space and Soviet collectivist ideals. This takes places differently in each author's case. However, in both cases the necessity to view oneself as an exemplary Soviet person ceases to be either the only or the primary theme. By avoiding making challenges to Soviet ideals, the authors actively shape personal, intimate environments that no longer fit into the "big" official world of their surroundings.

DE The Enlightenment; XVIII century; socio-political thought; perception;

AB The article explores the influence of the ideological and cultural heritage of England on intellectual elite of the USA, France and Russia in the age of the Enlightenment. The author emphasizes a non-unified process of the transfer of British political culture in various countries, due to the differences in their economic and political development. In the countries where bourgeois revolution took place, the ideological and political component of British "heritage" was in high demand, and representatives of the bourgeoisie became its conductors. This ideology did not find a response in Russia where the feudal relations were still strong. At the same time, Russia was open for all things western, and to the British culture on larger scale. Elites were more interested rather in achievements of science, technology, education, culture of England, than in its political system. Unlike other countries, in Russia the political elite as conductors of the Western culture was influenced by the acts of monarchs. Civil society was not able to formulate essential tasks for any reform of a state system yet, and therefore was not capable to choose suitable ideological elements from cultural heritage of more developed countries. Thus, it is possible to speak about various forms of perception of cultures, and also about possibility of classification of typology of cross-cultural communications.

LA English
DT Article
DE dependence on import; import substitution; high-tech products;
   production localization; cluster associations
AB At present, Russia's economy is dependent on import in some of its strategically important sectors. The recent economic and political developments such as the aggravation of geopolitical situation and termination of economic partnership between Russia and a number of countries and entities, and also the Government's policy that aims to reduce import dependence determine the need to expand the interaction between domestic producers and the need to use domestic resources, materials and equipment in economic activities. Import substitution in Russia can become a driving force of its industrial growth. The paper presents different interpretations of the term "import substitution" contained in several publications of recent years; it also reveals a common approach of the authors to this problem. The article summarizes existing proposals on priority areas of import substitution such as the shift towards import-substituting production and technology in strategically important industries. Mechanical engineering is seen as a most important industry in this respect. Russia's machine-building complex is a highly diversified industry, therefore the policy of import substitution implies that it will be implemented efficiently in various sectors of mechanical engineering on the basis of the differentiated approach, with regard to industry and sectoral specifics. The article considers a strategic framework for the implementation of the import substitution potential on the example of railway engineering. The authors reveal trends in the development of the internal market of railway engineering products; they determine the degree of import dependence for individual sectors of the industry on the basis of statistical data. The article substantiates priorities and possibilities of import substitution in different sectors, and in high-tech sectors of railway engineering. The authors point out a goal of import substitution in these sectors, the goal is to create qualitatively new types of products that provide technological parity between Russia and developed countries in the development of transport, and active influence on the development of the world market of technologies and science-intensive products. Effective implementation of import substitution policy is possible only on the basis of interaction of all the participants of technological chain, including designers of products and technologies, suppliers, and customers. The best way to organize such interaction is to form cluster associations. The article shows the role of clusters in the implementation of import substitution policy at the regional level on the example of the railway engineering cluster in the Sverdlovsk Oblast.

AB The paper deals with the scantily explored phenomenon of family correspondence of the provincial merchant class by focusing on the epistolary heritage of the Nassonov family from Perm in the early 20th century. A study of non-business letters exchanged between the members of one of the entrepreneurial dynasties of pre-revolutionary Perm enables to shed light on some aspects of the provincial bourgeoisie's private life, including family practices and the norms existed in their environment. The paper is concerned mainly with the letters written by a younger generation of the family (aged from 9 to 18) and addressed to their mother, Augusta Nassonova. The correspondence of young Nassonovs is considered as a phenomenon of children's writings; therefore, special attention is given to the ways in which the letters were written. An attempt was made to trace gender and age distinctions between the texts of adolescent boys (ages 11-14) and girls (15-18 years). Those differences manifested both in the choice of topics and in the way of description. The addressee provided a certain influence on the subjects selected by letter writers. The mother expected children to write to her during her/their absences in Perm and in that way participated in their lives by sharing their joys and troubles. The letters were full of references to the children's everyday life, providing much material relevant to the methods of upbringing and education, leisure activities and hobbies of young Nassonovs, relationships within the family. Apparently, the authors were more interested in the inner lives of the family and events that would touch them or their immediate surroundings directly. The great political events (e.g. war or revolution) attracted their attention rarely. It is concluded that such narratives have a definite value in the study of the world of urban bourgeois families and childhood in the province of the early 20th century.

The main focus is on the analysis of artistic creativity, and journalism, especially "Diary of a Writer". This allowed us to identify the political views of F. M.

It is concluded that the main cause of the political turmoil in the 1860s - early 1880s, the spread of revolutionary ideas the writer felt a deep moral crisis afflicting Russian society. Therefore, the cause of the crisis he saw not in reforming state institutions, and in fundamental moral renewal of Russian life on the basis of Christian Orthodox values.

AB Data of all-Russian surveys carried out in 2013 and 2014 by the Institute of sociology, Russian academy of sciences permitted to look Into norms and values of Russian middle class, its views on the desirable vector of country's development. Values that guide middle class members in their everyday life are of modernized activist kind, a fact that differentiates them from other population groups, while political values and attitudes to further development of the country do practically not. Among middle class members (and the rest of Russians), there is a consensus on the rejection of copying Western development model and of Russia's "special path" into the future. This is a result of specific norms and values, as well as the middle class attitude to private property, rule of law etc.

   Russia's and Europe's historical development
AB Traits that some have regarded as distinctively Russian had appeared previously in Europe-sometimes two, three, or more centuries earlier, albeit with variations. Nevertheless, like any country, Russia did have distinctive features brought about by religion, geography, and political and economic conditions. Russia's location on the periphery of Europe, its multinational population, and the influence of its eastern neighbors reinforced these features. Russia embraced Western civilization later than other European countries. Whereas after the fall of the Roman empire most people in western Europe occupied a relatively familiar and well delimited territory containing previously developed centers of Roman culture, Russia's historical development occurred in an uncivilized, immense, and constantly expanding space.
   Russia lagged behind the rest of Europe; but this does not preclude its basic similarity to Europe in the social, economic, political, and cultural spheres. Russians and Europeans have shared common features of development, particularly in the spheres of religion, geography, and ethnicity. However, Russia developed asynchronously with other European countries. Russia's Europeanization was not the product of borrowing but the inevitable result of its own evolution, essentially similar to Europe's but delayed by the conditions of its historical environment.
   Although this lag placed Russia at a clear disadvantage in international power relations, it cannot be attributed to any hypothetical, peculiarly Russian moral or cultural failing; for the cultural and spiritual richness of this society, at both the popular and the elite levels, has been amply demonstrated.

DE society; sociology; public opinion monitoring; experience of regional

AB The article presents the experience of the Institute of Socio-Economic Development of Territories of RAS in conducting sociological research on the territory of the Vologda Oblast and the Northwestern Federal District. It describes the historical aspects of formation of the system for public opinion monitoring and examines its theoretical and methodological foundations. The author of the article analyzes the structure of monitoring indicators and provides a brief interpretation of research findings that reflect social wellbeing and social perception trends. In addition, the paper analyzes people's attitude toward the activities of federal and regional authorities, trends in social well-being, consumer sentiment and also the complex indicator -the index of public sentiment in the region -developed by ISEDT RAS researchers. The results of sociological studies carried out at ISEDT RAS correlate with the dynamics of the all-Russian public opinion polls conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VCIOM), Levada-Center, etc. They indicate that Russian society gradually adapts to new conditions of life after the collapse of the USSR. Besides, opinion polls show the most important features of the post-Soviet Russian history at its present stage; they are associated with the intensification of international political relations, the consequences of the "Crimean spring" and the new challenges Russia's economy is facing now. The article concludes that as global community, of which Russian society is part, is evolving, sociological knowledge begins to play an increasingly important role in administration and national security; this is associated with the greater importance attached to intangible development factors. Therefore, a necessary prerequisite for administration effectiveness in all its stages is to implement the results of sociological research on social transformation trends and factors in the system of managerial decision-making. Twenty-five years of ISEDT RAS experience clearly show that this principle is relevant, it enjoys great demand and brings actual practical results. It indicates that the system of feedback between society and government, a feedback based on sociological research, provides extensive information on social well-being, economic situation, and political attitudes, helps evaluate the effectiveness of government economic and social policy more adequately, address the rights and interests of various population groups in the development and implementation of socially important managerial decisions.

DE hybrids; political institutions; network society; crowdsourcing
AB The concept of "hybridism" in political science has become the result of the theoretical search to describe the new political realities that have emerged in crises, "transitional" or different socio-cultural contexts. Hybrid forms of political institutions were the subject of research interest of V. Merkel, A. Croissant, G. O'Donnell, H.K.Bhabha, S.P. Peregudov, I.L. Prokhorenko, I.V. Kudryashova et al. The purpose of our research was to assess the status and trends of development of modern hybrid political institutions. The research methodology was based on the ideas of M. Castells' network society, "risk society" by U.Beck and "fluid modernity" by Z.Baumann, the concept of deliberative democracy. The authors used comparative and neo-institutional approaches, network analysis, policy documents analyses, monitoring of Internet resources. Hybrid political institutions of different origin and destination became the objects of the research: state, political parties, political regimes, crowdsourcing platforms. The term of "hybrid state" appeared in the political thesaurus when there emerged atypical forms, that "did not fit" the classification matrix. Spain, calling itself "autonomous state" formally remains a unitary, but it is a decentralized regional state. Party hybrids combine party and group functions, implementing them within a kind of synthesis (5 stars Movement in Italy, the United Kingdom Independence Party, Pirate Parties). Crowdsourcing platforms as a hybrid of activities in online and the offline spaces, substantially extend and modify the capacity of civil society in its dialogue with state. "Fluidity" of modern society is associated with non-linear processes and societal changes caused by the development of network sources. Political hybrids are mostly generated by changes in the nature of identity and political culture. Heterogeneity of political space is an important consequence of globalization, and it leads to heterogeneity of actors interacting in it. We concern the hybridity of political institutions more as a model of development, than as an organizational deviation. The concept of hybrid political institutions enables the development of theoretical and methodological tools for understanding the processes taking place "here and now".

DE government; civil society; models of Homo: a "Homo mythicus", "Homo
   historicus", "Homo oeconomicus"; axial time; liberalism
AB After the collapse of the Soviet Union, most economists and sociologists have concluded that humanity finally found the optimum, the highest form of political and economic structure. Francis Fukuyama was proclaimed "the end of history". Such representation is directly related to the entered Hobbes dichotomy of "state" and "society", which also marked the beginning of the New Age.
   B. Latour argues that this dichotomy lies at the basis of the division of science into "natural" and "social" and is wrong. M. Gefter distinguishes models "Homo mythicus" and "Homo historicus". The model of "Homo oeconomicus" is a kind of myth and used to transform the axial time scale of classification societies in size wealth.
   Liberalism rejects the notion of a political, not a basis for the positive content of the concept of the state. Use of liberalism as an ideology, paradoxically, may lead to a growth rather than decline conflict and increase the danger of war.

AB The author makes an attempt to justify his hypothesis that Russia since the early 2000s demonstrates a quite typical for many countries undulating process of rise and fall of public interest to the different political models. In particular, there are periods of waning of interest in socialism, followed by a period of its temporary rehabilitation, restoring of interest in democracy, then a temporary retreat from it, and again short-lived interest to authoritarian forms of government. The paper focuses on the reversible fluctuations of Russian public opinion in 1990-2000s on values related to traditionalism and modernization, attitude toward the West and, particularly, ethnic identity, as the major interest of the author. This article demonstrates some features of ethno-national identity of residents of the Russian Federation (especially - of its ethnic majority) in relation to the evaluation of policies, emphasizing at the same time the typological similarity of trends of change and fluctuations of public opinion in Russia and in many other countries. Waves of ethnosociological vibrations are compared with the change in attitude of the Russians toward the ideas of socialism and to the neo-liberal political stereotypes, in perception of Russians. The author emphasizes that there is a universal wavelike process that has its own specifics in Russia, as in any other country, but there is no any "special way" interpreted by its ideologists as a mystical predetermination of the Russian authoritarianism.

AB This article examines the potential of transmedial storytelling to analyze the national Imagination on the basis of deliberative public debates involving opinions, ideas, narratives and images of various social groups. The article is based on the presentation of Denis Saunin's and George Mamin's sculpture Russia. Try to kill! (CF Art Group) at the 2013 Venice Art Biennale. The author starts by looking at this art object, created on the basis of the All-Russian competition of art concepts on the topic of "the Russian National Idea." The object of visual analysis contains a dynamic political representation: the unification of the images of a sovereign's orb and a traditional tilting doll, creating a provocative effect alongside the slogan Try to kill!, resulting in an aggressive counter-game with the viewer. Textual analysis is conducted with 458 art ideas which were submitted to the contest and which have shown a significant range of substantial references for understanding the national idea of Russia.
   The next stage of the textual analysis focused on the selected of art concepts representing a storytelling or narrative description of the art object. The most widespread symbols are state symbols, family and children, Christian symbols, living images, anthroposentric images, reflecting a traditional and archaic complex of ideas. Thus, the national unifying idea is visually aggressive, and also substantially traditional, as if to say that it is better for Russians to live in the shadow of the state, of Christianity, in combination with elements of their pagan heritage, with their family and their children.

AB The article discusses the development history of the theory of economic crises under capitalism conditions. The author believes that economic science is being developed in two directions. The first direction is represented by science schools that deny any objective grounds for crises of overproduction in the market economy and develop new models of crisis-free growth. The opposite direction is supported by science schools acknowledging the existence of objective causes of crises, which is of practical significance for development of effective anti-crisis measures. The study is summarized by the conclusion about actualization of the political economy approach to analysis of the recent global crisis and its consequences. Its implementation anticipates special attention to different versions of overaccumulation of capital which played a key role in the origin of crisis processes in the world economy.

AB One can find different opinions concerning the beginning of political transformation in contemporary Russia. One group of scholars date this process from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, others - from the last years of Perestroika, the third - from its start in 1985. Whenever the date to take as a starting point, we have a substantial historic period that fits a quarter of a century, especially if we try to trace noninstitutional change, transformation of political mentality of Russian citizens who were born in the USSR and live in new Russia. The article describes transformation of citizens' psychology under the changing political context during about a twenty five years period. Change of political concepts, images and values were chosen for analysis from a huge number of different psychological phenomena. On the basis of data from the study carried out by the author during all this period, she makes an attempt to give a periodization of political optics' changes in the course of political transformation in Russia. These data brings the author to a conclusion that currently we became witnesses of the end of this twenty-five year period and an emergence of a clearly new condition of psychological state of Russian society that will definitely influence political process in nearest future.

TI RESOURCE NATIONALISM: LESSONS OF THE THIRD WORLD

DE raw material resources; the oil industry; "the resource curse";
   "resource nationalism"; economic dependency; colonialism; institutes;
   Mexico; Venezuela; Argentina; Iran; Iraq
AB According to the hypothesis known as the "resource curse", natural resources abundance is a brake on economic growth of many Third World countries. But is it really so? The author believes there are deeper reasons why the Third World in general - regardless of the amount of raw material resources available in each country - cannot achieve the same level of welfare as the First World. The "resource curse" theory looks for the origins of the resourceful countries' economic problems in the institutional sphere. But this seems misleading because of excessively narrow "here and now" approach. The economic and socio-political institutions of individual countries are regarded in short periods of time when "curse" declared itself. Its typical manifestations, such as rent-seeking, stagnation or degradation of the institutions, authoritarian power, snowballing public debt and symptoms of Dutch disease, were seen in many Third World countries long before the development of the major sources of raw materials and regardless of the availability or absence of them. Therefore, it seems appropriate to speak of a kind of "three-fold institutional curse" as an explanation of continuing underdevelopment of many countries and territories. Poor national institutions in the Third World countries are not actually caused by the presence or absence of concentrated natural resources. This is the result of prior historical development with series of discrete transitions from one condition to another: from colonial status - to independent statehood; from poverty - to unexpected wealth mostly based on the exploitation of the natural resources. Qualitative transformation of national institutions usually lags far behind. As a consequence, institutional development enters into a state of stagnation (inhibiting or destabilizing economic growth) that can stretch for very long periods of time. The author concludes that the presence or absence of resources, in fact, has no fundamental impact on the nature of socio-economic development of Third World countries. The major reason hindering institutional progress has external nature, that is heavy economic dependence on the First World (coupled with informal political subordination). This circumstance begets the "resource nationalism" by the developing countries - exporters of raw materials and fuel. History of "resource nationalism" provides a useful lesson for Russia whose economy is features by growing dependency on resources.

AB The article discusses the problem of defining the role and functions of civil control from the political and legal thought perspective and in the context of the possible ways of civil society and state authorities interaction. The demand for external evaluation as a prerequisite for the development of political system and the demand for establishing an effective feedback mechanism within it together with the lack of a unified approach to the interpretation of civil control in the political science and legal doctrines determined the relevance of the study of the established traditions in the interpretation of civil control in social sciences and humanities. Whereas social and power relations always develop within a specific legislative framework, whose maturity and consistency largely determine the state of civil society, it is not possible to evaluate control functions of the public sector otherwise than through the study of the legal framework of the state. Thus, the article describes the evolution of the views on possible formats of social and power relations in the context of transformations of the European social thought and political and legal approaches to the perception of power institutions, building a dialogue between social and political organizations, defining the forms of civic participation in political decision-making and interpretation of civil control.

DE the party of socialists-revolutionaries; emigration; revolution; civil

AB The article is devoted to interpretations of the history of the party of socialist revolutionaries given by the SRS in the final, the emigrant period of their existence (1920-1930). The author analyses the features of the socialist revolutionary emigration after October 1917, the key moments of its formation and development. The formation of the socialist revolutionary emigration after the October 1917 had its own peculiarities in respect of members of the PSR (unlike the social Democrats, Mensheviks or members of the cadet party), generally not practiced expulsion abroad. The repeated attempts of writing party history, attention to the issue of eminent party members are also marked. The history of the PSR was the subject of research of V.M.Chernov, S.P.Postnikov, V.V.Sukhomlin, O.S.Minor. Socialist Revolutionaries in exile several times referred to the history of the party in connection with major events of the political life of Russia and Abroad in 1920-1930. The author also analyses the problems of party history during the controversy surrounding the trial of 1922 over the leaders of the PSR, as well as at the conference of the Prague group of the Party of Socialists Revolutionaries in 1931. The process of 1922 brought to life official interpretation of the history of the PSR given largely for promotional purposes. More frank and critical analysis is contained in the speeches of the conference on theoretical Prague group of the Party of Socialists Revolutionaries in 1931. The author examines the main approaches SRs emigrants to the activities of the party in 1917-1920, the period of revolution and civil war, highlighted the reasons for the failures of the RPS in the political struggle. On the whole SR authors, while acknowledging their political mistakes, the main reason for the defeat considered the weakness of those social forces that could draw in Russia of democratic socialism. The social pillar of democracy the socialists-revolutionaries considered the "worker class" (workers, peasants, intellectuals), but the Social Democrats - the proletariat. Unfortunate for socialist parties of the outcome of the Russian revolution was associated primarily with the fact that these public classes are not yet fully formed and to achieve the required degree of maturity. Underscored the revolutionary impact of evaluations on the subsequent development of foreign historiography. Version emigre historiography and memoirs about the reasons for the defeat of the socialist party has influenced the historical development of foreign science. Still, this topic has not been the subject of special study. Meanwhile, the claims of the socialist revolutionary emigrants "authentically peasant folk" nature of their party was actively used Western historical science, especially in the 1950-es. Emigrant liberal and socialist literature emphasized the idea of "artificiality" the Bolsheviks came to power, recognizing rights for authenticity only after the February revolution, seriously influenced post-war Western, primarily American, Russian Studies.

AB The article investigates evolution of the right of nations to self-determination in the political ideologies of Russia, U.S. and European countries in the XVIII - XX centuries. It explores the role of great powers in formulation and implementation of international norms of self-determination. Finally, it analyzes national approaches towards resolution of self-determination conflicts in the XXI century. The author comes to conclusion that divergent interpretations of the right of nations to self-determination in contemporary policies of these countries are rooted in their political cculture. The U.S. and European Union countries endorse the liberal concept of self-determination which defines nation as a civic society, and the right to self-determination as a legitimate right of citizens to establish such political regime that protects their rights and freedoms. The Western countries nowadays maintain their support of protest actions against authoritarian regimes in favor of liberal-democratic ones. Russia upholds a different concept of self-determination, defining nation as a multiethnic society which combines integrity of the state with ethnocultural diversity of the peoples comprising it. Self-determination of such nation can be realized by a democratic choice of any political regime which preserves and promotes its cultural and civilizational specifics.

AB The article presents a historical overview of the development of the traditional economy of the indigenous population of Yakutia during the end of XIX - the 80-ies of XX century. Historical retrospective proposed by the authors traces the socio-economic characteristics of the rural areas of Yakutia over a long period. The development of the major traditional economies of rural Yakutia considered at eventful historical background. Different political and socio-economic factors highlighted: they dictated the trends in cattle breeding and agriculture.
   It was found that, due to the remoteness from major economic centers, poor transport communications, as well as unfavorable climate in Yakutia formed a special type of rural economy. The authors pay particular attention to the negative impact of collectivization policies on agriculture, aggravated by natural disasters and hardships during the Great Patriotic War.
   In the study of factors of the agricultural development the authors positively evaluated the experience of scientific support and the implementation of scientific and technological progress for traditional sectors of economy. The analysis of published and unpublished sources convinces in following: despite a series of administrative changes in the centuries-old traditional rural economy Yakutia it proved viable and adaptable to the socio-political challenges of the twentieth century.

DT Article
DE emigration; standard of living; way and quality of life; values, needs;
   social situation; power
AB The goal of the article is to research problems of potential emigration from Russian provinces. The attitude to emigrate from Russia is one of the most important generalized indicators of problems of the country. External and internal factors determining this attitude are analysed on the basis of data of representative regional research in 2013. External factors are social, economic and political living conditions in the Russian provinces. Internal factors are value orientations, attitudes, requirements. Three types of attitudes, and, respectively, three markedly differing groups of respondents are shown. The first group of "the disoriented, practical people" aims to leave Russia forever. They are, mainly, young people sharing the idea "to be able to enjoy life pleasures" ready to work only for good money or those who do not want to work at all, but dream of fast material success. The second group "optimists" self-actualize themselves in the homeland and want to leave Russia for a while. Their main value orientation is interesting work allowing to show their abilities and talents. Desire to self-actualize themselves, to expand scale and space of their life and activity are main reasons for leaving Russia. The third group of "traditionalists" would not leave the country under any circumstances. People, usually elderly, with family, sharing civilized traditional values of Russian-Soviet way of life do not want to leave Russia. They are not aiming at material success at any cost, try to live by the truth, conscience, justice and are ready to do at their work everything they can irrespective of the salary size. It is shown that different systems of value orientations and needs are cornerstone of these distinctions. Their conflict with existing social and economic and social and political conditions is main reason for leaving Russia. Today aspiration to emigrate is closely connected to uncivilized character of Russian labor market and lack of stable vertical social Mobility channels.

TI Auditory Democracy: Including Silenced Subjects in the Political
   Community
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE public communication; auditory attention; political listening; auditory
   democracy
AB Auditory democracy is a relatively new western political philosophical concept which is not yet known in Russia. The concept implies a shift from the subject of public speech to our ability to listen to each other. Listening is understood here not as a physical sensory capacity of the human organism, but as political practice and virtue. Whether or not we acknowledge our opponents as equal subjects of interaction depends on our predisposition to listen or not to listen to them. Our unwillingness to listen to each other is regarded as one of the most effective ways to exclude our interlocutor from the discourse and to uphold social and political injustice.
   John Dryzek, one of the theoreticians of auditory democracy, argues that "the most effective and insidious way to silence others in politics is a refusal to listen." On the contrary, auditory attention attests acknowledgment and respect towards opponents regardless of substantial differences and motivates them to speak. The thematic set introduced by this article includes texts of British researchers who work with the concept of auditory democracy and similar fields. The authors show that listening as a value of political life and communicative skill has not garnered much academic or political attention. At the same time, the institutional development of listening practices could help contemporary society to be more inclusive and to better articulate differences. This article focuses on the central question of how listening could become one of the principles in constituting a new political community.

AB November 20, 2015 marked 40 years since the demise of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. With his passing Spain entered into an era of tremendous economic and socio-political changes. At the stage of democratic development Spanish nation achieved three key objectives: it built an open and modern economy; in political sphere a relatively effective de facto two-party system was created; social protection was provided to the bulk of the population. All this strengthened Spain's international positions and provided it an attractive image. The country attracted millions of immigrants. The world crisis of 2008-2009 stopped the growth of the Spanish economy. Spain was in crisis long six years and only recently began to come out of it basing on a new development model (a "rebound" model). By a number of parameters it is different from the pre-crisis paradigm of the growth. The crisis had serious impact on Spain's foreign relations. In particular, serious reputational losses challenged Madrid's efforts to counter the crisis, to reduce the negative effects of external shocks on the international scene and to find opportunities to give additional impetus to the development of the country. These challenges defined new foreign policy agenda: protecting financial and economic interests of Spain abroad, strengthening the positions of the Spanish companies in world markets, coordination of anti-crisis actions with partners in the European Union. Madrid stands for a sort of integration core within the EU, consisting of six founding countries of the European Economic Community (Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands and France), as well as Spain and Poland. This projected grouping is intended to serve as the vanguard of the movement in the direction of making the EU more effective.

The theoretical and methodological basement of this new branch of science is the concept of 'society of all-embracing risk' proposed and developed by the author in 1980-90s. The subject matter of the proposed complex discipline is the forces which generate the critical situations; their disposition, resources and strength; their values, strategies, tactics and action repertoire; an environmental dimension of the emergence and evolution of such situations; a changing quality of social capital of affected people, local and abroad; and characteristics of post-critical states and politics of their rehabilitation. The indispensable prerequisites for the establishing of such discipline are as follows: full-time integration of various natural, technical and social professionals and politicians; a capability of such interdisciplinary teams to play a double-role of insider and outsider in relation to a critical situation; and a long-term and permanent monitoring of its evolution.

TI STORIES ABOUT MIRACLE-WORKING ICONS IN THE STRUCTURE OF LICEVOJ
   LETOPISNY'J SVOD
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Licevoj letopisny'j svod; Voskresenskaya letopis'; Nikonovskaya
   letopis'; Theotokos of Vladimir; Theotokos of Tikhvin; Theotokos of
   Kolocha; legend; textology
AB Licevoj letopisny'j svod of Ivan the Terrible is a major monument of the Old Russian written tradition of the 16th century which completed a centuries-long history of Old Russian chronicling. Stories on miracle-working icons in its multileveled system were included into a vast historical context and acquired a new publishing tone. The author aims to determine the role of icons of the Virgin Mary in Old Russia in Licevoj letopisny'j svod and how episodic and semantic memory about them is preserved.
   The arrival of a large number of transferred and displayed icons as well as the ones painted by hermits in Russia was a characteristic feature of the late 14th - early 15th centuries. Stories of icons developed into an established narrative form in the print culture of the 16th century and chronicling played a significant role in the literary process of the epoch. This fact can be explained by the establishment of the ideology of autocracy, which was based (among other things) on the phenomenon of miracle-working icons.
   In the structure of Licevoj letopisny'j svod, there are stories that stand out among others, and they are those of three miracle-working icons, namely, the Theotokos of Tikhvin (1383), the Theotokos of Vladimir and the Theotokos of Kolocha (1413). It is noteworthy that these three legends found in Licevoj letopisny'j svod contain subjects connected with the names of Dmitry of the Don's three sons: Vasily, the Grand Prince of Moscow, Yuri of Zvenigorod and Andrei of Mozhaysk. This without a doubt granted them an official status in the historiographical narrative.
   What makes the legends in Licevoj letopisny'j svod stand out is the combination of two texts: verbal and visual. The illustrators of Licevoj letopisny'j svod added to the written text, not following it completely at times yet complying with the existing cultural tradition. The chronicle's interpretation of the stories was different for all of the abovementioned icons. The Story of the Meeting of the Theotokos of Vladimir was most likely written specially for Licevoj letopisny'j svod. One of the peculiarities of the text is its poly-figural architectonic which is congenial to the structure of Licevoj letopisny'j svod, demonstrating its connection with the history of Licevoj letopisny'j svod. It was only in the late 15th - early 16th century that the story of the miraculous manifestation of Theotokos of Tikhvin in Novgorod in 1393 appeared as an independent legend. In Licevoj letopisny'j svod it is represented as a short, chronicled account borrowed from Voskresenskaya letopis' and, according to a textological analysis, from Library Manuscript II. The brevity of the story of Theotokos of Tikhvin in the Licevoj letopisny'j svod is a characteristic feature of the monument, testifying to scant knowledge of the event during the entire 15th century. These circumstances make the rise of the importance of the icon even more meaningful. The analysis of the chronicle's history of Theotokos of Tikhvin demonstrates that its political cult grew in the 16th century, and Licevoj letopisny'j svod played a decisive role in the process. The plot describing the manifestation of the icon of Theotokos to a common villager on the Kolocha River around Mozhaysk is documented in a majority of Russian chronicles. The expansive chronicle history of Theotokos of Kolocha spreads over the period from the 15th to the 17th century. The form and content of chronicle articles on Theotokos of Kolocha are varied, which is conditioned by the aim and orientation (including both political and ideological ones) of various chronicles. According to textological analysis, Theotokos of Kolocha was transferred into Licevoj letopisny'j svod from Nikonovskaya letopis' retaining all the peculiarities of the chronicle. The role of Theotokos of Kolocha was considerably less pronounced in the political mythology of Ivan the Terrible's epoch, which is supposedly due to the fact that the text bore semantic memory of the struggle between minor appanage princes of Mozhaysk and the grand princes.
   Consequently, the three legends of miracle-working icons in Licevoj letopisny'j svod had different sources. The chronicle's writing in the second half of the 16th century was another stage in the history of the text's well-known subjects. The analysis of stories about icons enabled the author to reveal a number of features in the formation of Licevoj letopisny'j svod, to specify its connections with Voskresenskaya letopis' and Nikonovskaya letopis' and the chronicle of 1560 and to determine the role of the legendary "biographies" of icons in the structure of Licevoj letopisny'j svod.

AB Competition and cooperation, which covered a variety of countries, there are not only in the sphere of economy, politics, but also in science. It is caused by the fact that the economic and political status of countries, the welfare of their populations are largely derived from the results of the scientific community in these countries. That is why one of the trends of development in several countries of the modern world, more recently, focused on maximum preservation tradition in economics, politics, social life, together with the adoption of a strategy to build and maintain in operational condition of the capitalist system of industrial relations has been the growing interest in innovation, to expand scientific activity. This study assesses the current trends in the development of science and innovation in Russia, identifies prospects optimize the functioning of the national innovation system. In the work are identified the main trends of development of science and innovation in the modern world, the attention paid to globalization and internationalization of research activities. Reveals the interdependence of content value imperatives of functioning using the capitalist mode of production, and the development of targets, which are put forward to science by society and the state in these countries. Comparative analysis of the historical experience of the research and innovation activities in Russia and developed countries shows the dominance of the role of the state and the militaristic nature of the national innovation system in Russia. Assessing the current state of the national innovation system shows a tendency of the Russian state to the preservation of the existing system and the direction of its functioning and in modern conditions. Analysis of the consequences of this policy allows us to assert that it could lead to further degradation of the national innovation system. The results show the need to choose a strategy of development of the national innovation system, in which the role of government should be to revitalize the other actors of the innovation system - private companies, entrepreneurs, universities and so on. It is necessary to create a competitive environment in the area of innovation, open access to resources for all subjects of the national innovation system.

   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE

DE existence; sign; meaning; projective semiosis; evolution
AB The question of existence is a classical ontological and metaphysical question. Rational criteria of existence are formulated in accordance with the object and the subject. Something exists if 1) it can be seen, 2) it can be the value of a variable, 3) it can be taken into consideration by means of the interpretant. Somebody exists if he/she 1) fixates the objects while observing, 2) is able to negate, 3) is able to recognize interpretants. Something exists as an object, as a means of system determining of this object, as a skill of determining and, finally, as materially presented substance in which this skill is realized. Matter or substance of semiosis (that create the sign) is the least developed category within the frame of semiotic approach. On the one hand, semiotics has an idealistic character ascribing the feature of substance to specific rationally stated functions but not to the abstract essence. On the other hand, classical semiotics is receptive or structural, i.e. it investigates objects, rules and possibility conditions in the variant of their realization for a subject who perceives them (e.g. the reader of fiction or observer of natural phenomena) or for the systems constituted by observing structures. The question about sign matter is important because it deals with the conception of projective semiosis, i.e. with the account by semiotic means not only of quasipassive fixation of objects by subjects but also the processes of their active imagination, projecting and technical embodiment. If we agree with the hypothesis that to exist means to "be the sign", we must understand the "meaning" as realization of the semantic rule defined by syntax and the skill of signifying which determines a certain material substance of the sign. Therefore, "existence" presupposes the necessity of interpretant for any pragmatically determined type of a sign (perception, psychic experience, communication, ethic norms) as well as syntactic rules and substance, but it doesn't presuppose the necessity of "meaning". From the point of view of semiotic justification of pluralism philosophers need to deal with the tasks of analysis of history of projective semiosis within the frame of ontology, analysis and contrast of methods of constituting and contemplation in mythopoetic consciousness, literary, scientific and engineer-technological activities; analysis of human problems in pluralistic ontology, demonstration of the evolution of contrast skills and consideration skills which constitute different types of essence; revelation of the possibilities of rational reflection as an ability to constitute or reveal new interpretants defining new types of essence.

It is shown that the sincerity condition of the form "S intends to do A" is a necessary condition of doing the speech act of promise, and the rule of sincerity of the form "Promise is to be uttered only if S intends to do A" that is constituting the promise as the speech act is a sufficient condition of understanding (recognition) of that the promise has been uttered. It led to state that J. Searle and R.A. Yuriev's requirements to recognize insincere promises as promises, and, therefore, speech acts, are untenable and wrong.

Searle's works: "Speech Acts. An Essay in the Philosophy of Language", "How to Derive "Ought" from "Is", "Freedom and Neurobiology. Reflections on Free Will, Language and Political Power". The J. Searl's theory of speech acts becomes a basis for creation of social ontology. Addition of the theory of speech acts with the consciousness theory allows J. Searle to approach a solution by means of introduction the concept of "constitutive rule". Constitutive rules give a capability to establish the status functions for the situations, objects and individuals. But problem of the origin of the constitutive rule remains unsolved. Thus according to J. Searle from the descriptive statements we can derive the evaluative statements in the frame of the institutional facts, but we cannot come to idea of obligation. Regularity of using of the constitutive rules seems to be the weak argument.

AB This article examines the public diplomacy 2.0 as a relatively new tool of foreign political activity aimed at creating a positive image of the country abroad. In the modern world of politics it is becoming increasingly important due to such factors as the growing number of World Wide Web users, the decline in the popularity of traditional media and the rapid spread of new media, as well as the transformation of the Internet space into the platform for active political interactions.
   The key role in implementing the programs of this sector of public diplomacy belongs to foreign Ministry, politicians and social activists, as well as mass media (especially, television channels. involved in international broadcasting). The analysis of the foreign policy efforts of various countries in the social media roughly demonstrates that public diplomacy 2.0 includes three activity areas: the promotion of content to different hosting services (Flickr, Instagram, YouTube, etc.); the use of microblogging services (Twitter, Tumblr, SinaWeibo, etc.); sharing information in social networks (Facebook, Google+, Second life, etc.). Currently, the main obstacles for the development of public diplomacy 2.0 include the absence of recognized evaluation criteria, low participation of non-governmental organizations in its implementation, as well as the insufficient efforts of foreign ministries of different countries to establish a dialogue with foreign audiences.

AB The image of the head of the State as a significant factor illustrating the attitude to the country of the world community, the success of its foreign policy, is constructed by various media including the "quality press" represented by "Spiegel" - one of the most influential magazines in Germany and Europe.
   Over the past three presidential election campaigns involving V. Putin his image characteristics in "Spiegel" have evolved from a predominantly neutral to negative. The results obtained by qualitative methods are confirmed by quantitative indicators obtained through the method of content analysis: significant increase of lexical units that characterize the unlimited authority of V. Putin and at the same time the decrease of lexical items describing the extent of his popularity in the community. However, V. Putin's personal characteristics were polar: both positive and negative.
   In constructing of V. Putin's image by German journalists there has been a shift of emphasis from the problem of Chechnya during the first presidential race to shortcomings in the functioning of democratic political institutions in the other two. According to content analysis the number of articles devoted to Chechnya has reduced sharply since 2003.
   Modeling the image of the President of Russia "Spiegel" takes into account a wide range of opinions, rests on official statistics, uses a variety of data collection methods, which suggests a significant proportion of objectivity of both the information itself and the image created on its base. However, the German journalists are not free from biased assessments of certain activities of the Head of Russian State.
   The image of the leader of a foreign country as a multidimensional phenomenon is justified by a lot of reasons to be presented in a certain perspective. In this case, one of the determining factors of this is the political course of the President. Since the basic components of the negative image of V. Putin created by "Spiegel" are related to the problems of the democratic political process, human rights in Russia, so to expect the transformation of the image of V. Putin in the German weekly magazine for the better without real positive changes in the RF political sphere is hardly possible.

AB On geo-economic and security grounds, the Black Sea region qualifies to play a much more essential role for Europe, the Middle East, and Asia than it is currently accorded. However, the recent instability in southeastern Ukraine is a trigger for further significant transformations of the region. This article examines the key political tendencies in the Black Sea region in view of the current situation revolving around Ukraine. The author outlines the basic contours of the competition among major powerbrokers in the Black Sea region, which are willing to make concessions and create new alliances in order to rebalance the distribution of power.

TI THE CONCEPT OF A "LEARNING REGION" IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL SCIENCE

AB This article considers the main foreign work, initiating the concept of "learning region" in contemporary social science and political practice. The main objective of the work is a new understanding of the economic and political stage of development of society, expressed in terms of "knowledge economy", "network culture" and "interactive learning". Foreign authors propose their own experience of conceptualizing the notion of "learning region", which are summarized in a general theoretical paradigm. Theoretical basis of the concept of "learning region", which occurs at the intersection of innovation and economic geography theories are evolutionary economic model (A. Marshall), cluster theory (M. Porter), the concept of "social capital" (R. Putnam) and the theory of "industrial areas" (M. Storper).
   American researcher R. Florida calls the regions key economic unit of a new era of global capitalism, which is included in the new era of knowledge creation and continuous learning. According to Richard Florida's analytical focus "learning region" is the process of learning in networks as an important organizational mode of the knowledge economy. Swedish researcher Bjorn Asheim raises two major themes: networks as the most convenient forms of organizational learning and agglomeration advantages for learning. The author argues that the best organizational form of networking is quasi-integration. Asheim emphasizes geographical aspect of learning networks, which creates advantages of agglomeration defined territorial conventions. According Asheim territorial convention, together with the regional innovation policies and institutions that support innovation, forms the institutional structure of the region. Kevin Morgan pays special attention to the concept of "social capital", which becomes crucial for understanding the nature of capitalism as a "learning economy". Social capital determines the institutional capacity of the region, is the main objective of the regional policy. According to K. Morgan network paradigm is able to unite economic geography and innovation theory. Based on the analysis of these concepts, we can conclude that interdisciplinarity of the concept "learning region" can act as a basis integrative concept of "network culture" and methodological tool for the analysis of its economic and political spheres.

AB Considered in the context of the risk characteristics of the main non-classical epistemology. The author states that for non-classical epistemology peculiar transformation, according to which the main priority of cognitive activity shifts its focus in temporal terms with the present for the future. Subject of interest in this case is not so much what he knew, but the fact that he can learn. Truth as the main criterion of scientific knowledge loses its priority, and gets more and more significant risk, acting as one of the key dimensions of knowledge. Risk of acquiring the status of an epistemological phenomenon that demonstrates the growing degree of uncertainty as the background of the cognitive process and the need for the subject to know the world (decisions) in the face of increasing uncertainty. It is stated that in terms of the implementation of cognitive control researcher with respect to its reflection is possible only on the principle of self-control. The researcher should be aware of its responsibility to the world, to society, to assess the possible negative consequences of their ideas. It also determines that the risk as a measure of human life and society (including epistemological side) does not necessarily imply a negative impact. These effects can also be positive. This is the essence of risk associated with the fact that a person decides to certain actions in situations of uncertainty in order to achieve a positive result. And because it works, not realizing the fullness and depth of the situation in the first place, epistemologically, then there is a risk factor as the gain factor of uncertainty. Epistemological nature of the risk is due to the variety of risks, respectively necessity of their evaluation and selection. Many risks, the need to choose the most appropriate one, generates epistemological uncertainty. Therefore, the subject and the need requires risk as an inevitable condition of epistemological strategy nonclassical type. The author concludes that the risk of being a multi-faceted concept, namely as an epistemological phenomenon acquires key importance for all other different sides of application.

DE postmetaphysics; internal relations; notion of sense and nonsense
AB The paper is concerned with the interconnection between postmetaphysics and notion of internal relations in Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Internal relations are relations which could not fail to obtain, since they are given with or (partly) constitutive of the terms, such as white's being lighter than black. One could easily generalize conception of internal relations in connection with Wittgenstein's typical points such as rules of inference, truth, logical forms, tautology (Tractatus 5.132, 4.442, 4.12, 5.1362 respectively), and the limits of language which also represent internal relations. A relationship between world and language is also internal. Meaningful proposition obliged to have pictorial common structure with reality of states of affairs (the Tractarian isomorphism theory). This is well known Tractarian notion of sense and nonsense. In the paper I argue that main Wittgenstein's postmetaphysical ideas are always closely associated with conception of internal relations and thereafter with sense/nonsense criterion.

DT Article
DE consumer expectations; cohort analysis; generation analysis; consumer
   sentiment index; consumption; saving
AB The research deals with the analysis of consumer expectations of Russian population, which are mediated by many socio-demographic characteristics: income, age, education, place of residence, sex, etc. The paper points up the influence on variable "age" because it is rather complex itself. First, actual age represents biological characteristics. Second, "age" represents a unique birth cohort in terms of socialization and formation of life experience. Finally, all ages feature influence by a time period effect that reflects the socio-political, economic, and informational phenomena of the macro environment. Solving the problem of "identification" (i. e. the separation of these three effects), which inevitably arises in case of cohort analysis, is based on theoretical views concerning the character of consumer expectations and the results of empirical testing. Its point is that the aggregated Consumer Sentiment Index (CSI) reflects the general socio-economic situation in a country at a certain time and allows us to use the CSI as a distillation of a specific time moment. The information base of research is the data of consumer survey although not the panel, but conducted over a 15-year period on the same methodology and sample. All 79 waves of cross-section data (from May 1996 to September 2009) were converted into a "quasi-longitudinal design", the total sample of dataset was 182,507 respondents. The regression analysis demonstrates that belonging to a cohort actually determines significantly consumer sentiments. However, the nonlinear correlation describing such dependence showed that an increase of optimism/ pessimism in respect for the economic and social development of the country happens non-uniformly from one cohort to another. In addition, the article attempts to implement approach to differentiation of generations, is not based on age differences, and the relationship with historical events. The research shows that an indicator such as the CSI could be one instrument for defining the time boundaries of the generations.

DE charity in Russian history; public charity in Russia; legislation
AB Studying the phenomenon of charity is of particular interest for philosophers, historians, and leaders of society. However, in the Soviet period, this issue was not examined at all, for political reasons. Nonetheless, charity has always reflected the level of socio-economic development of society and the state of moral culture and civilizational maturity of society. Therefore analysis must take into account three elements of charity in Russia: the historical background (context), the concept, and the practice of charity.
   The phenomenon of charity in the tradition of the Russian state is considered in this article. Legal documents of the XV - XXI centuries served as the main acts which regulated charitable work. Analysis was made of specific practices of charitable activities in Russia carried out on the basis of these legal documents.
   The State, church, and community organizations were agents of charitable activity in pre-revolutionary Russia. They were the foundation for social support to needy populations.
   Private charity didn't exist in the Soviet Union. It was considered a "cost" of the bourgeois system, and was replaced by forms of state social welfare.
   In the post-Soviet Russian life charity returned in 1995 at the legislative level. Both citizens and legal entities may participate in charitable activities, and these exist today together with state social security systems.
   The evolution of ideology and organizational forms of charitable activity during the pre-revolutionary, Soviet, and post-Soviet periods are considered in the article.

AB There seem to be no easy ways to form standardized assessment criteria for new technologies given their novelty both in terms of science and technology and in terms of commercialization. The needs of the knowledge-making and the market agents are not easily reconciled. Given the ambiguity of the situation, negotiation and communication skills of the applicants come to the forefront as well as their ability to stand up for their innovation and create a sort of 'material-semiotic protection'. This research addresses the attempts at 'construction of entities', i.e. attempts of applicants to create the network, and the ways the experts from funds responsible for proposal assessment are devising to counteract the attempts. We have interviewed people involved in the application process in Tomsk universities and research institutes, both applicants and experts, and analyzed the discourses used by applicants to substantiate their innovations and gain the support of influential actants for protecting the innovation and substantiating its benefits, as well as methods used by the experts to minimize the impact of the practices in decision-making processes.
   Such a view of the problem is reminiscent of a broader approach when we analyze both internal and external agents involved in development of science and scientific knowledge. The approach is intrinsic to constructivist (interpretivist) scientific views originated from studies of scientific laboratories which later brought about a new discipline, Science and Technologies Studies, which demonstrates that science is pre-determined by the environment, locality and culture and involves complex socio-technical systems, including non-human actors.

Despite its specific nature, its connection with physical space is growing, furthermore, the states describe themselves as leading actors of information space more actively. Although the approaches differ from one another, information space is being generally perceived in the traditional categories of sovereignty, borders and territory. The states serve as accelerators of interrelated processes of militarization, securitization and diplomatization of information space, which are typical for other spaces. Strengthening such tendencies and including a greater number of countries lead to new forms of cooperation and conflicts.

AB Corruption as social phenomenon is studied by a variety of disciplines. anthropology, criminology, development theory, economics, political science, psychology, sociology. Each of them has developed its own scientific traditions associated with different methods of collecting and analyzing empirical data, such as participant observation in anthropology or sociological interviews. In this paper we describe experimental methods, which in recent years have emerged as an important tool for interdisciplinary social analysis. In the first part of our work, we describe and confront experimental methods to other tools of social analysis, and characterize their relative strengths and weaknesses. In the second part, we turn to the experience of using experiments to study corruption and show their power and applicability whenever other methods are powerless. These conclusions are illustrated by the material of a unique laboratory study involving police officers of middle rank as experimental subjects, conducted by A. Belianin and L. Kosals in Moscow. We model corruption as a public good for potentially corrupt participants and measure their attitude towards this institution under different experimental conditions, especially those when its existence is pointless from individual and social rationality viewpoint. Our results speak in favour of combination of various research tools and methodologies for the study of complex social phenomena.

AB The article examines the sociological and political views of the Slavic public figure of the XVII century - Yuriy Krizhanich (Juraj Krizanic). He was exiled to Tobolsk where he developed a Pan-Slavonic grammar that incorporated numerous Slavic languages and wrote the original scientific works seeking to understand the role of the Slavs and Russia in the world historical process. His works provide an interesting sociological perspective on the public administration, the social structure and the sectors of the economy of that time.

   politics
AB The article provides an analysis of new health consciousness, particularly in relation to "healthism". This includes a review of the origins of this phenomenon and an examination of the key directions for its problematization. "New health consciousness" can be observed in the increased significance of self-preservation in the public discourse and the shift of liability from public health services to that of the individual. "Healthism", on the other hand, relates to the tendency towards moralizing a healthy lifestyle and warning of the negative consequences for those who do not follow the model of the healthy citizen. The emergence of these phenomena at the end the 20th century is a result of a complex interplay between social, political and economic factors. The key directions in the study of new health consciousness are outlined as the analysis of cultural beliefs surrounding a healthy lifestyle, its politicization and commercialization, regulatory implications, the ideological foundations of healthism and the gender aspect of the phenomena. The topicality of these issues in sociological research underlines the significance of sociological expertise in public health policy and health promotion.

AB This article employs the Cox proportional hazards model to discover the factors of survival of 162 party systems from 1792 to 2009. In order to avoid the endogeneity problem, the analysis employs the level of democracy as a control variable. The impact of the overall level of party system fragmentation is found negligible, even though excessive fragmentation is conducive to a higher hazard of party system termination. More importantly, systems with close competition among leading parties - including two-party systems and systems with close competition among up to four parties - are more likely to survive across time. The article introduces a methodological innovation by disaggregating the effective number of parties into two components, the leading parties' balance and the residual fragmentation.

From this analysis it is concluded on the need to implement various functional opportunities of journal websites. Described in detail the necessary relationship between main structural components of the journal: journal - issue - section - article as well as the infrastructure of journal websites. We substantiated the necessity of filling the fullest information about authors and meta-data of articles to optimize operation of search engines. Speaking on the site functional options we highlight the need to create bibliographic descriptions of articles in the CoinS format (that is a special international format). Requirements of international citation systems for journal sites are given. The new version of the site of the journal Polic. Political Studies illustrates our approaches to discussed problems. The Open Journal System is a platform for creating websites for journals considered, as well as its advantages and disadvantages analyzed.

The author pays a great attention to the process of overcoming of various historical myths and false interpretations in the beginning of XXI century accompanying long since the scientific theories of evolution of state in different epochs. Special attention is paid also to the new classifications of states winning recognition in the modern social science, first of all, the conception represented in the book of Douglass C. North, John J. Wallis and Barry R. Weingast "Violence and Social Orders". Critical notes are directed against both the postmodernist classification of statesmanship in the work of Martin van Creveld "The Rise and Decline of the State" and some domestic 'revisionist tendencies' in history and political science.

DE Nikolai Ye. Markov; Union of Russian People; monarchist emigration;

AB This article highlights some little-known episodes from the emigration years of a prominent Russian right-wing politician, the former leader of the Union of Russian People, Nikolai Yevgenyevich Markov (1866-1945). Based upon documents (specifically, personal letters) from the Markov collection at the Bakhmeteff Archive, Columbia University (New York, USA), most of which are introduced into scholarly circulation for the first time, the article contributes substantially to our knowledge and understanding of Markov's views between 1930-1939 on Russia, the Soviet Union, communism, the internal party struggle in the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, fascism, and monarchy. Having correctly identified a transformation of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union and having witnessed the triumph of fascist regimes in Europe, this right-wing politician made hasty and erroneous predictions about an imminent replacement of European dictatorships with monarchies and the collapse of the Soviet system and the overthrow of its political system-something that he believed would be accelerated by the coming war. If Markov had been able to sense the beginning of the evolution of the Bolshevik regime, he failed to understand the true sentiments of the Russian people. His anti-Semitism and fear of Masons, which was typical for the former leader of the Black Hundreds, eventually led the monarchist politician to cooperate with the Nazis, despite his claims that fascism was not suitable for Russia.

AB The study is dedicated to the role of social capital in ensuring the competitiveness of the social and economic systems. The indicator of interpersonal trust is used as the important indicator of social capital. Trust and distrust are considered in the article as separate categories, the distrust and its role in the economic component of life in the regions and countries are considered. The theoretical provisions revealing the mechanisms of distrust influence on the economy and the competitiveness of economies are given. The article statistically examines the link of indicators of trust and distrust on the level of countries and Russian regions and the competitiveness of countries and Russian regions. The assessment of parameters of interpersonal trust /distrust at the level of regions of the Russian Federation and the country in general on the basis of the Public Opinion Foundation are provided. The calculations of the correlation between the scores of countries' competitiveness and credibility of the countries on the basis of survey data from the European Social Survey (ESS), as well as the data of the World Economic Forum on the competitiveness of countries in 2008 and 2010 are also provided. Our empirical study confirmed the link between the low level of interpersonal trust and competitiveness of the Russian economy in general, and the state of the country's institutions. At the same time, we fail to confirm the link between the indicators of interpersonal trust across regions and economic indicators. This may serve as a confirmation of the fact that regional communities have virtually no effect on the behavior and economic decisions of persons taking decisions in the regions. This can be explained by the lack of relationship between trust to the elites making decisions and their position due to the lack of selectivity of the first persons of regions and mechanisms of the real impact of the population on economic decision- making, as well the lack of mechanisms leading from the trust to the position of the elites. The results of the study can be used for development of policy for appointment /elections of governors, interaction between political elites and the society, in the theoretical studies.

AB Education system both in Russia and abroad has its own traditions and customs established throughout the centuries. Despite the fact that every country establishes specific educational systems which capture the peculiarities of socio-political framework and national and cultural differences, there is a certain degree of commonality among them. Innovative teaching is focused on developing an individual who is adaptable to constant changes in society, living conditions, to effective and durable acquisition of science basics by means of developing creative capabilities, thinking, and communication skills through new technology. When using innovation technologies, lesson (task) system transitions into the lesson that is 'a leading form of living' (lesson-creation, lesson-labor, lesson-communication, etc.). Through our research that focused on teaching Tatar as a non-native language, we came to conclusion that using such tools as modular teaching, problem-heuristic technology, online-teaching can substantially improve the quality of education. As a result, we observe increased motivation and interest in studying; strengthened cognitive activity; more comfortable atmosphere of mutual understanding and support; developed creative potential and skills.

DE multiparty system; political competition; political begavior; democracy;

AB The article states that multi-party system developed in Russia in the wake of radical reforms, has been in a constant state of crisis. Based on the data from representative sociological surveys it examines the signs and the main causes of the crisis, paying special attention to peculiarities of the modern transformation of multiparty system. The authors emphasize that the ongoing changes of party policy implemented "from the top" to optimize the party system, only hinder the creation of a truly competitive political parties and disorient people. Recent years have seen the low level of trust in political parties, lack of interest in their activities, weak linkages of large groups of population with traditional political institutions, the constant loosening of newly formed party loyalties. Compared to modern democratic societies, where parties are viewed as the most important structural and functional elements of the political organization of society, in Russia political parties are estimated by a large majority of citizens as less important in comparison with other political institutions. Russians claim that the possibilities of the parties, except for the ruling party, to adequately respond to the increased demands and requirements of groups whose interests they express are very much limited. There are noticeable signs of weakening of the opposition parties in the Duma, not able to compete with the ruling party. As well as strengthening of barriers to the creation of new authoritative political forces capable to improve political life in the country. The authors emphasize that constant and considerable changes of party politics prevent the establishment of a stable system of party loyalties, weaken the dependence of political behavior of citizens on society traditions of political choices and increase the likelihood of unpredictable political behavior. Analysis of the balance between the party reform plans and mass political sentiments leads to the conclusion that the course of creation of a multi-party system with wide pluralistic orientation finds no support in the overwhelming majority of Russians.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE constitution; presidential powers; president; parliament; power;
   democratization
AB The paper identifies the factors influencing the scope of presidential powers. To test the hypotheses via simple OLS regressions, a new Index of presidential powers has been developed which evaluates presidential powers in comparison with parliamentary powers. The Index is based on the approach of M. Shugart and J. Carey but their way to measure presidential powers was modified in order to be more in line with the aims of the paper. The predictors are: a) the political uncertainty in the period of constitution-drafting process; b) the comparative strength of actors participating in the constitution-drafting; c) index of democracy; d) the breach with the authoritarian past; e) geographic location; f) ethnic fragmentation. The sample consists of countries where a new constitution was adopted after 1970. The results are robust to alternative versions of both independent and dependent variables and to the exception of the most influential observations. The results show that contextual factors (geographic location) are much more significant than factors which imply universal causal mechanisms. The paper indicates that contextual explanations of the scope of presidential powers either can be proposed instead of explanations based on universal causal mechanisms, or they can be used along with the latter and deepen them. The most important limitations of the paper are: small sample size (N = 44) and subjectivity associated with the development of the coding rules which lie behind the Index of presidential powers. As far as the latter is concerned, there is the free access to coding rules via the internet-link in the paper.

AB The article covers the work of the International Round Table " Russian Peasantry and World War I" which was held on the 11th of April in Moscow by the Russian Association of Historians and Archivists. The round table was organized within the framework of the research project " The People and Power: Russian History and its Falsifications". The proceedings include papers presented by more than 30 scholars from research journals, research institutions and universities of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. They also cover the essential content of the discussions held by the experts mostly dealing with different aspects of interaction between the peasantry and the authority, between the peasantry and political parties of the Russian Empire during World War I and in the aftermath of the war, including the revolution of 1917. The discussion was of interdisciplinary character, with many modern approaches and strategies in social science and humanities being applied, such as historical and anthropological, socio-cultural, socio-psychological, geopolitical, demographic, economic, sociological, politological, etc.
   A special attention is paid to changes which occurred in the peasants' lifestyle and in their consciousness as a result of military, modernizing and revolutionary novelties. Also the discussion involved the transformation of traditional rustic society into revolutionary masses, the militarization of peasantry, the emancipation of peasant women, social deviation, the escalation of old and new conflicts in the countryside. All this was said to have brought about a new political reality fraught with a revolution.

AB The economic crisis that began in 2008 can truly be called a systemic crisis. The social, economic and political institutions that capitalism created for its own stability today not only impede the free movement of capital and thus are destroyed by the bourgeois state, but they themselves can no longer grow in the old social, economic and legal framework. The welfare state is now experiencing its own crisis. The only alternative to the current situation is the transformation of the social sphere without subordination to the purposes of production. Meanwhile, the most radical global revolution will not stop the unfolding global crisis and will not bring relief if it cannot develop and implement a strategy of social modernization.

The author discourses upon comprehension and practical assimilation, by society, of the unique Russian experience of inner overcoming of totalitarianism; upon the drama of the new Russian liberalism that turned disproportionate to the historical tasks which it tried to solve; upon acutest problems of the Russian constitutional transformation. Principal tasks of the present stage of Russia's political transformation are formulated in the article.

DE use value of knowledge; forest engineering education
AB The main purpose of the paper is the justification of modern scientific directions of innovative processes in the field of enhancement of the higher engineering education for forest industries' needs, providing its prestigious positions in the world. Now the value assessment of wood resources is underestimated because of unreal value in use that leads to decrease of the wood income. Growth of the wood income is possible on the basis of the new forestry busyness concept the meaning of which consists in a real estimation, both current receipts, and dynamics of wood assets. Taking into account deficit of natural resources the authors assert that science and quality education should act as a profit source in forestry busyness. Evolution of knowledge in key source of cost assumes availability of innovations and methods of their practical application in them.
   The paper affirms that new knowledge should occupy key positions in ecology development of the wood industry branches. This circumstance considerably changes a place of the status of timber formation in structure of values of public life, a ratio of its spheres, as higher education and economy. The paper underlines insufficient interest of the state structures to an estimation of potential competence of forest engineers for realizations of professional activity because of considerable presence of "not profile" scientific and pedagogical staff for training of engineers for forest industries of economy. It points to absence of the erudition approach to training of the wood & paper goods appraisers with the level of potential competence, sufficient for achievement of the strategic goals of a wood complex development.
   The paper presents the innovative views of necessity of creation and development of essentially new kinds of business in the sphere of forestry, involving businessmen as full subjects of carrying out scientific researches within the frames of the sustainable development and reproduction business concept, considering them as a potential reserve of scientific and pedagogical staff of educational establishments.

Among these areas of science are psychology and socio-psychological sciences, logic, cybernetics, mathematics, semiotics, cultural studies (including subcultures studies), sociology, anthropology, evolutionary biology, linguistics, history, ethics, education, political science, regional studies, law, ethnography, psychophysiology and neurobiology. We substantiate the necessity of research, allowing to predict the mediation success, and give rational explanations for why and when this method is applicable. The possibilities of actual and potential use of mediation in various areas of modern society are shown.

   UNDERSTANDING OF TIME
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE eschatology; historical time; history of Christianity
AB The paper sheds light on the problems of Biblical eschatology in the context of its influence on the contemporary understanding of historical time. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate a fundamental connection of the contemporary understanding of time with the conceptions, which existed within the scope of the Biblical religious tradition. It was important for the author to draw attention to the history of translation and interpretation of apocalyptic texts as strategies preceding a number of techniques of contemporary description and comprehension of history. With this purpose there are given examples of means ancient exegetes used in their aspiring to actualise the value of eschatological legacy despite the loss of keys to prophetic symbology of these texts. Moreover, the characteristic traits of religious perception of time which can be traced in secular consciousness, including contemporary historical science, are considered in the paper. On the basis of a number of historical examples of the interaction of history and eschatology and the demonstration of exegetic experience of identification of apocalyptic prophecies with the historical reality the necessity is sustained in the paper of research of the eschatological problematic by historians for the exposition of the principles of contemporary understanding of historical time. Besides there are discussed some aspects of Biblical eschatology in the light of their interpretation in different historical periods. The paper rises the problem of the canonical status of the Revelation of John the Evangelist in the light of its historical interpretation, and also some eschatological fragments of other Biblical books in their functional role in different political situations around the Christian church. In the paper, the connection is grounded of the Christian eschatological conception and the social-historical factors. Therefore, some arguments to the alternative reason of not using the Revelation of St. John in Orthodox liturgy are given. The eschatological thinking and religious conceptions are considered in the paper as a source of the contemporary understanding of time. There are demonstrated the possibilities of the use of historical-anthropological aspects of religious studies of this problem, which consist in a complex system of interpolations of uncanonical, canonical, exegetical and analytical spheres of literature. In the paper, there are not raised the sacral senses of Biblical Apolcalyptics, but an attempt is made to single out systems of logical moves in the eschatological literature with the purpose of their comparison with the dominant historical approaches.

DE think tanks; expert community; community of political scientists;

AB The paper is devoted to the analysis of development of expert communities and think tanks in three neighbor Russian regions: Chelyabinskaya and Sverdlovskaya oblasts and Permskiy kray. It was demonstrated on the experience of these three regions that prominent conditions for the arising think tanks of different types are a real level of political plurality and existence of community of political scientists. The corresponding conditions are most suitable in Permskiy kray, where arbitrary democratic political practices take place and where authoritative and stable community of political scientists exists. Owing to these conditions a lot of stable think tanks work in this region, and many of them act as public policy centers. In the case of Sverdlovskaya oblast the existence during fifteen years of two stable power centers - governor Eduard Rossel, and mayor of oblast' central city Arkadiy Chernetskiy, ensured some level of political pluralism. Many political scientists used then to participate actively in political struggle as experts, experiencing consequences of fail of their patrons. During the last years frequent changes of governors accompanied by renovation of regional political elites resulted in diminishing of most analytical centers. Chelyabinskaya oblast is at the end of this list. Governor Peyotr Sumin dominated in the political field near to fifteen years, and community of political scientists are very weak and split.

An Introduction to the X&Y Theory" (third edition), are presented in the paper(2). Earlier editions of the book first appeared in 2000 and 2001. And, the 2001 edition still benefits from brisk demand by Russian social scientists and their university students. According to data from the Scientific Electronic Library ELIBRARY.RU, the 2001 edition registers as the book most frequently cited by Russian sociologists, and as the third book most frequently cited by economists. At a host of universities throughout Russia, institutional matrices theory is currently included in the curricula in sociology, political science, and institutional economics. This new edition offers some improvements; by clarifying key theoretical points, offering new empirical data, and juxtaposing the author's forecasts to empirical evidence. This reviewing edition is more comprehensive and better designed in order that the reader might readily access and quickly comprehend the X&Y-theory advanced by an author.

DE Petrograd garrison; Revolution of 1917; the regimental meetings
AB This paper investigates the regimental meetings as a special democratic institute, formed during the Revolution of 1917. Until now, this issue had a very small place in research compared with the study of soldiers' elected organisations. Regimental assemblies and meetings were so popular that their decisions were often more authoritative than opinion of the soldiers representatives in committees. Regimental rallies got spread in Petrograd garrison because they were supported by left-wing political movements, especially by the Bolsheviks. Meetings were, in some cases, counterbalance to the existing authority. With their help, the Bolsheviks and their allies sought to re-elect moderate committees or to pressure on their decisions. On the one hand, regimental assemblies and meetings helped soldiers participation in political life. On the other hand, they destabilised the situation in the troops and caused internal conflicts.

DE small and medium-sized enterprises; Russia; state support for SMEs;
   business climate; shadow economy; irrational administrative barriers;
   expert community
AB There is a sham contradiction between public policies to support SMEs and features of Russian national SMEs. Using western experience in Russia, doing some bright projects to stimulate small businesses was important twenty years ago. Quantitative and qualitative parameters of SMEs in Russia lag behind most countries, largely due to the structure of its economy with the traditional dominance of large enterprises and the prevailing business climate. Small and medium-sized business in Russia is not innovative, does not perform antitrust function and does not create many jobs. Small and medium-sized business generates a positive competitive environment. But the importance of SMEs in Russia should not be exaggerated. The scale of subcontracting and franchising with independent small businesses in our country is extremely small. It happened so that the Russian economic policy and the leading part of the national political establishment were in a subordinate position in relation to the interests of a narrow circle of large businesses, mainly engaged in production and export of the most important natural resources. Manufacturing, infrastructural and other facilities of big business, its supply and marketing relations and, most importantly, its long-term economic interests focus on large enterprises and, with few exceptions, show no interest for the SMEs sector. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the Russian system of economic institutions encourages big business mostly. It also proves an essential specific situation of small and medium-sized businesses in Russia. The development of Russian small and medium-sized business entirely depends on the state of the economy and the business climate in the country. The business climate in Russia does not correspond to the needs of small and medium-sized businesses. Measures to improve the business climate can potentially help Russian small and medium-sized businesses much more than the existing costly system meant to support them. It is obvious that the whole Russian system for SMEs support, fold increase in the federal budget to support Russian SMEs occurred in the recent years, is unable to compensate for a generally unfavorable business environment in Russia. It is necessary to improve the quality of investment, business climate and institutions in Russia. The real growth of the Russian SIV1Es can be expected only with the modernization, new industrialization of the Russian economy and business climate improvements.

Different paradigms have the image of their own, different social ontology is emphasized, different answers to the key questions of visual researches are given: what the correlation between the image and social reality is; how the image functions and influences social reality and people's behavior. The naturalist interpretation of the visual is a reflection of the objective social reality. The structuralist approach aims to analyze the visual as a socio-cultural text, to single out culture codes of interpretation. Constructing the image is the process of setting separate fragments of the reality (objects) and creating a picture of the world out of them. The phenomenological horizon stresses the activity of both the image and the subject of perception. The content of the image here is not only about representation and interpretation of social reality, its presentation aspect is expressed. In the paper the social functions of visual images are systematized.

DE ecosemiotics; ecolinguistics; sign systems; memory; cultural inheritance
AB This article studies different aspects and perspectives on ecological approach - a new interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological paradigm that is applied to the investigation of the systems' communicative and distributed cognitive processes. The main focus of this work is on ecolinguistic, ecosemiotic and biosemiotic studies with their heteronomous, system-first, context-oriented approach to understanding of sign systems and informational processes. It is shown that biological and social, cognitive and communicative processes are evolutionary integrated, mutually regulating and developing. Because of this the studies of the origin and evolution of various means of communication and information transmission have to consider at list three system characteristics: biological (genetic, epigenetic, environmental), social (cultural habits, social context, culturally inherited means of communication) and individual (cognitive skills, personal interpretations). It is argued that in biological and social systems a theoretical distinction between organism and environment is reasonable for research purposes, but in reality it is conventional. Many communicative and cognitive processes take place on system level where environment is essential part that implements, accumulates, transmits and regulates particular biological and social activities. Therefore, researchers can study as a special object of their investigation "territorial dialects" that maintain, direct and reproduce biological and social structures and informational processes. In the article a term "circle of representation" is also coined to refer to a process of representation where elements represent and are represented by the system, since in the framework of ecological approach the distinction between context and language is as well arbitrary as opposition of environment and organism. For instance, it is stated that not context reveals the meanings of particular, "opposed" to them signs (words), but context and signs are one system where the general process (or knowledge) reveals and determines the existence and content of the particular processes and is mutually revealed by them, like road signs reveal rules and are revealed by them as their concrete re-presentatives embodied into environment. Thus, ecological approach, by studying system "affordance" and "scaffolding" of cognitive and communicative processes and their role for the transmission and reproduction of biological and social systems, reveals their ontological nature and objective foundations of their existence and development.

AB Necessity of transfer to innovation model of development determines accentuation of the governance of the country's attention on the theme of innovations and instruments of their introduction. Furthermore, the theme of innovation development is one of the of methods of state positioning inside and outside of the country.
   In the article is presented an analytical review of the state campaign's instruments of promotion of the innovation development script. There are strategic fundamental documents (including the Strategy if innovation development up to 2020), and initiation of new authorities, accountable for innovation policy (The President Council for the economy modernization and innovation development of Russia), and significant government regulations for the support of innovations (N2218, 219, 220, April 9, 2010), and decisions for forming of innovation environment (technological platforms, innovation territorial clusters, science cities, tech parks, technology transfer centers etc.).
   However there is a conflict between inside and outside positioning of innovation policy. While Russian leaders declare new instruments of innovation development, for leading world powers Russian innovation police is practically imperceptible and unconvincing. Besides, key problem is low demand for innovations and absence of entrepreneurial spirit in Russian economy.

DE visual image; technical image; optical political regime; political
   subculture of observers; construction of political reality
AB The article is focused on the concept of a visual image. The visual image essentially is a product of the imagination where his constructional nature appears. And a political design is carried out by modelling when a political idea is symbolically represented in the visual row of the perceived reality. In other words, the program serves as a representation or a symbolic image of the political world. Further the idea of a visual image is treated in the work on the basis of the concepts "technical image", the apparatus and the program (V. Flusser). The technical image is created by the political apparatus which program is realized by a leader-programmer. But the apparatus can only resign the reality, and the leader depends on this apparatus. As a result, new technical visual political universes are created, such as a photographic political universe. As a technical TV world, it is "dotty" and combinatorial, and not a linear one. So, on the basis of visual phenomena the whole optical regimes are constructed, both Soviet and postmodern ones. The article gives the example of the Stalin optical regime of "panopticon" where the Soviet "spectators" began to see clearly the future that had already came. Also here it is indicated on Putin optical mode of the third-party "viewers" passively perceiving the political world designed around the symbolic figure of the leader.

DE political psychology; political values; political generations
AB Today the problem of the aspects of the political consciousness of the Russian youth is relevant and discussed in the scientific community. The study of political ideas and values of young Russians as the basic components of the political consciousness is a part of the political-psychological approach.
   In different historical periods the youth appears to be the most politically committed part of the country population. The results of the survey show that nearly three quarters of respondents are interested in politics, although the interest is mainly generalized.
   Most young people define their political preferences within liberal-democratic spectrum.
   Young people's representations of power are characterized by clarity, cognitive simplicity of statements with predominantly neutral emotions.
   Russian young people have consistently shown a willingness to participate in the elections for the last seven years. It appears that for young people elections namely represent democratic development and the ability to influence key decisions.
   The analysis of the values of democracy in the dynamics has shown that for the last seven years current values in the political consciousness of young people are "freedom", "human rights" and "respect for the law."
   The data, obtained with the help of R. Inglehart's technique, show that the most actual political values in the minds of youth are materialistic values.
   In general, it is necessary to conclude that, compared to older generations of Russian citizens, modern young people seem to be more politically committed, show more interest to politics and their own citizenship, which in return can serve as a basis for optimism towards the political future of our country. Features of the political consciousness of modern Russian youth are largely determined by the age specifics and the position that this generation has in the structure of Russian society.

DE political sociology; everyday life; frame-analytic; practice concept;
   biography
AB In modern sociological theories the global research is interwoven with everyday life study. The scientific interest to everyday life is provoked by changing borders of public and private space, appearing new forms of political participation. Everyday life sociology actively uses qualitative methods of research. Address to biographies as a method of collecting socially important information is a reflection of individual modern life. Sociologists characterize biography as a social construction which reflects everyday life event structure. Using a biographical approach in the political and sociological researches allows us to understand at least two points. First, is political activity a form of processing the specific biographical experience? And second, what is the status of political everyday life in an individualized life project? The article is devoted to the review of biographical method potential study in political sociology of everyday life. The author discovers two research traditions in everyday political sociology and shows the opportunities of applying biographical analysis in given directions. In political sociology of everyday life there are two alternative approaches in everyday world analysis: frame and practice theory. The frame is considered as a matrix of possible events and scheme of events interpretation. In frame-analytic tradition of everyday political sociology the biographical method is used for public movement study. Framing is defined as an activity of the movement to create a semantic framework, which ensures public support. According to the framing concept social movements comprise various biographical types participating in collective actions frame production in different ways. Biographic method allows us to study not only what (frame) and how (framing) but also why keying of frame form the corresponding process. In political sociology of everyday practice a discussion of methodological '' combination'' of biography research and discourse-analysis dates back to criticizing Michel Foucault's human sciences. The philosopher puts forward a thesis about new fragment subject appearance. He emphasizes that an individual has become an object of scientific discourse due to appearing discipline control mechanism. In Foucault's theory of subjectivity the individual is made as a subject and individuals construct their own identity themselves. Foucault's works stimulate biographical study. Biographical study and discourse analysis are methodologically interrelated as discourse is a part of biographical background knowledge, subjects take part in discourse reproduction. Discourse and biography can be regarded as order concepts within authority relations.

AB The review of the book by the Croatian historian Hrvoje Gracanin on the history of the region of Southern Pannonia, that is approximately the present-day historical region of Slavonia in Croatia, in the Late Antiquity and early Middle Ages (Gracanin, I Hrvoje Juzna Panonija u kasnoj antici i ranom srednjovjekovlju (od konca 4. do konca 11. stoljeca). Zagreb: Plejada, 2011. 455 s. ISBN 978-953-7782-02-3). It is stressed by the author of the review that the publication of a comprehensive monograph on early medieval Slavonia is an important milestone in the history of the study of early medieval Slavonia. The author of the review dwells specially on the interpretation by the Croatian researcher of such issues of the early history of Slavonia, as the historical circumstances of the appearance of the Croats between the rivers Sava and Drava, as well as the ethnic and political situation in Southern Pannonia in the 9th century.

DE Germany; culture; values; open society; human rights; moral
AB In the postwar period competent cultural policy is an instrument of the return of respect for Germany from the world community. With the transition to the postbipolar epoch the accents in the cultural policy of the united Germany were arranged differently. Its mission was seen in ensuring the peaceful coexistence of different cultures and mitigation of the ''clash of civilizations''. It was oriented on improving the quality and reliability of the German cultural communication with its partners around the world. Germany positioned itself as the bearer of the spirit of an open society that recognizes the shared responsibility for peace, sustainable development, human rights and freedoms. The last line became particularly important with the advent to power in Germany of the coalition the SPD - the Union 90/''Green''. In the cultural policy of Germany it provides for the consensus between the leading political forces in the country. This facilitated the adoption of foreign policy decisions, and eventually led to the mobilization of the necessary financial resources. Steps taken in the field of cultural cooperation were considered as part of conflict management by the German authorities. It performed diagnostic function, became an instrument for early detection of deviant phenomena in the socio-economic, religious and ethnic relations. This allows to use the cultural and information policy to facilitate their return to normal. The foreign policy of Germany in the field of culture indirectly performs the function of marketing. The German language became an effective means of promoting the interests of the German capital in the world. United Germany intensified international efforts in the field of education and science, especially at universities. German support mechanism for foreign policy in the field of culture runs smoothly, its key elements are private funds and specialized institutions of civil society. They contributed to the development of humanitarian cooperation with other countries, supplying the world with the positive information about Germany. German foreign policy priorities in the field of culture were reflected in its cooperation with Russia. German-Russian dialogue on culture acquired a new quality, performing for the German side the function of intellectual call that urgently requires improvement of the forms of spiritual expression. In general, the consensus of the authorities, business and civil society, has been made in the cultural field, allowing to realize the interests of Germany in the international arena.

DE Parenthood; civic activism; social problems
AB The article deals with the analysis of current social problems in the agenda of St. Petersburg parent's communities. The study of parents' social problems is placed in the context of Russian social policy. Parents' civic activism is considered as a result of politicization of the private sphere, childcare and education, as well as response to the challenges of the state social policy. Parents' activism is analyzed as a result of transformations of the private sphere meanings and values, which lead to the changes of meaning of marriage, partnerships, parenthood and parent-child relationships.
   The main possible approaches to the study of civic activism are presented, the heuristic potential and methodological limitations of the approaches in relation to the study of parent's communities are analysed, the characteristics of St Petersburg parent's communities are described, a general analysis of the socio-political context of the parent community development is proposed in the paper. Based on the analysis of interviews a number the problems that parent's activists consider as important were highlighted. The notion of social problem is understand from constructivist sociological perspective and implies a situation or a condition that is regarded by some individuals as unacceptable. The following actual problems in the discourse parents communities activist were found: the problem of responsible parenthood, the problem of social exclusion of mothers, the problem of violation of civil and human rights of mothers, the problem of orphaned children, the problem of family crisis. The activity of the parent communities aim to solving these problems. The discourse of parent's activists also includes the claims to the State policy to address the problematic issues.
   In conclusion of the article the analisys of discoursive gaps and overlaps between official discourse and the discourse of parenting communities is presented. The significant meaning match between official discourse and parent's naratives was found. The State traditionalist and pronatalist discourses become the parent's communities activists language for the discussion of social problems. In particular, the issue of family crisis and the need for State policy to promote family values in order to increase national fertility rate is a common place of the official discourse and the discourse of parent's associations. The point of gap between the official discourse and the discourse of parent's communities is the rhetoric of parent's civil rights and gender equality in the private sphere.

It is argued that the main factors of the "British disease" were not only external reasons - world crisis, stagflation and structural changes in economic development, - but primarily domestic ones - weak productivity, deficiencies of the educational system, antagonistic industrial relations, mistakes in post-war economic policy and an archaic system of political and social institutions.

The author defines the main attributes of the Russian political dependence on the Horde in the 14th century (the practice of granting the yarlyk's authorizing the rule of the Russian princes and their obligation to pay an "exit fee"), which had a direct influence on the nature of mutual relations. The article traces both the persistent attempts of the Moscow princes to free themselves from vassalage during periods of political instability in the Horde and the constant tendency to recognize subordination in the periods of the strengthening of the khans' power. The author points to a significant activation of the foreign policy of the Moscow princes over a few decades prior to the approval of Russian independence. This tendency had determined the subsequent foreign policy of the Muscovite tzars after the collapse of the Horde at the beginning of the 16th century.

AB The paper explores the outcomes of Russian Federation G20 Presidency in 2013. The analysis is based on the model of balancing external conditions and national priorities for developing an agenda in informal institutions (supply-demand model). This analytical paradigm allows to reveal to what extent the Presidency has managed to ensure: 1) a high level of response to the key global governance challenges in the agenda and summit decisions; 2) a balance between national and other members' interests in the Presidency priorities; 3) utilizing the institution's capabilities; 4) conformity of the role chosen by the Presidency (organizer, mediator, political leader, national representative) to the combination of external and internal conditions.
   Russia took over the responsibility for coordinating the G20 work from Mexico, accepting the rotating presidency of this premier forum for economic cooperation on December 1, 2012. The G20 met the fifth year of its work under conditions of a two speed recovery which by March 2013 transformed into a three speed recovery. Unsteady and sluggish growth, persisting imbalances and downside global economy risks demanded that this forum of the world largest economies concentrate the efforts on developing a set of measures aimed at boosting sustainable, inclusive and balanced growth and jobs creation around the world. These priorities constituted the core of the Russian G20 presidency concept, aimed at ensuring sustainable global growth and rebuilding of trust between the world economy different agents in accordance with the G20 mission and capability.
   Consolidating efforts on its core economic and financial priorities, the G20 also launched collaboration to overcome such risks as increasing income disparities, chronic underinvestment into development of safe, secure and modern infrastructure, unforeseen consequences of regulation.
   The analysis findings reveal that the Russian presidency managed to ensure a good balance of national interests and the partners' priorities in the G20 agenda; utilizing the G20 capabilities to respond to the key global governance challenges. The choice of the presidency role depended on the nature of the issues and was defined by a combination of internal and external conditions. Thus, the acuteness of the problem for all summit participants determined demand for leadership in including into the economic forum agenda the debate on a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Syria. On employment and social policies the Russian presidency combining the roles of an organizer and a political leader helped upgrade the G20 dialogue to a new quality level.
   A major success factor in deliberation and adoption of the comprehensive action plan on base erosion and profit shifting was the OECD capability to take responsibility for the plan development. With the OECD leadership, solid experts' foundation, and a high level of relevance of the problem for all members, the presidency supported the process as the organizer.
   On the topic of stimulating long-term investment, a priority for Russia as well as most of the G20 partners, the presidency managed to consolidate the efforts of several international institutions over a short period. On this priority, as well as on the financial regulation reform, the presidency acted as a representative of the national interests and an organizer. In developing the new development strategy the choice in favor of a combination of a mediator and an organizer proved most productive. As a result the G20 agreed a new cooperation for development outlook.
   The presidency active collaboration with the international organizations and engagement with social partners was instrumental in harnessing their experts' potential and enhancing the G20 transparency, legitimacy and effectiveness. The G20 institutions consolidation continued through development of new coordination mechanisms and strengthening accountability.
   Under the Russian presidency the G20 reaffirmed its value as the premier economic cooperation forum. Emphasizing restoring strong and inclusive growth and employment while ensuring fiscal sustainability, the leaders for the first time in the history of the G20 stressed that the well-being of individual people should be at the center of the growth agenda. This consequential outcome of the five years collaboration might be a start of a new G20 agenda where inclusiveness is one of the pillars of growth.
   The research was carried out with financial support of Russian Humanities Research Foundation within the framework of a research project "Elaborating a Supply -Demand Model to Balance External Demand and National Priorities in the Presidency Proposals for Agenda in G20, G8 and BRICS", project. 12-03-00563.

AB During the 20th century there have been many attempts to reconstitute political knowledge as objective, value-neutral empirical science. One of such attempts was the "behavioral revolution" in political science. However, apart from this tendency a different one can be traced: scholars strived to openly acknowledged political goals and values as a factor in their own work. In this case one can speak of "engaged knowledge". Pierre Bourdieu, a representative of this tradition, spoke of the need to give up an image of the "scholar who locks himself up in his ivory tower" and stop the "flight into purity". He urged scientists to bring their knowledge outside academia and join social movements. In the similar vein Michael Burawoy emphasized the necessity to make sociological knowledge available to the wider public. The article reveals the ways in which engaged knowledge distances itself from the image of political and social scholarship as "pure science" as well as from the approach of political philosophy with its emphasis on philosophic contemplation. This perspective opens up the way for the analysis of Max Weber's ideas on the value neutrality of scientific knowledge, essential features of the "behavioral revolution" in political science, as well as Leo Strauss' views on the nature of political philosophy. The article develops the ideas of feminist standpoint epistemology, which is contrasted with the scientist's "gaze from nowhere" and philosopher's "gaze from above". Finally, the article gives account of the problematic relation between engaged knowledge and the Marxist tradition.

AB The world city localization within the national borders is seen as one of inevitable conditions for the country to participate effectively in global scale processes. Thus political favoritism of national governments towards particular urban centers is obvious in a number of countries including Russian Federation. The article analyses political risks associated with neoliberal model of urban network constructing and emerging the favored world cities in national spaces. It is argued that the final result of this politics tend to be opposite to its goals and leads to the decline of territories where the world city is located. The EC experience provides alternative political agenda towards the urban network development based upon the principals of territorial and social cohesion.

TI The Impact of Tolerance on Economic Modernization in a Comparative
   Perspective
SO FORESIGHT AND STI GOVERNANCE
LA Russian
DT Article
DE cultural change; creative class; modernization; innovation; investment;
   institutions; tolerance
AB For the majority of countries modernization of any kind is an important part of the political agenda. Policy-makers and experts are challenged to elucidate its distinct paths in different economies, to show why some countries succeed and others fail on their way towards modernization, and to identify the factors that make success stories. In this case, close attention is paid to the linkages between modernization and value systems, in particular, to tolerance. The aim of this paper is to test empirically the assumption that tolerance exerts a significant positive influence on modernization (which is understood in its 'narrow' sense as economic and technological development) as well as the contribution of an enabling mechanism - political institutions. The theoretical frameworks of our study are the cultural modernization approach by Ronald Inglehart and the concept of the "creative class" by Richard Florida. We used data from 58 countries over 1996-2008, retrieved from the World Values Survey, as well as from the World Bank databases "World Development Indicators" and "Worldwide Governance Indicators".
   The analysis confirmed that tolerance does have a significant impact on modernization in terms of transition towards a post-industrial (innovation) economy. This process is associated with the emergence of a specific social class - a creative lass. Tolerance, expressed as a tolerant attitude towards homosexuality, gender equality, and a decrease in xenophobia, is a crucial prerequisite in establishing and maintaining favorable conditions for attracting creative people.
   Two distinct patterns of modernization are revealed, depending on the level of social tolerance: a tolerant model and a catch-up model. The post-industrial economy requires the formation of a relevant society based on the values of self-expression. However, some countries try to build a post-industrial economy without building a post-industrial society, although the probability of success in this case is rather low. This catch-up model focuses on investment, a lower-level of tolerance, and weak political institutions. The latter matter especially, and they seem to be the causal mechanism to ensure the linkages between tolerance and successful modernization. First of all, the linkage emerges from the rule of law and control of corruption. Institutions are regarded as a key element in the tolerant model of modernization, ensuring creative people to maintain openness, diversity, and protection of their interests, including the right to identity. Catch-up strategy, in contrast, puts the main emphasis not on values and strengthening institutions, but on higher investment rates.

AB Political decisions of the Eurasian states leaders (Kazakhstan, Russia and Belorussia) and the vivid discussion within academic and expert community of a Eurasian Union establishment led to a rise in research in integration processes within the post soviet area. The presented article discusses prospects of a new global-regional integration project (Eurasian Union). The purpose of this paper is to analyze experts' opinions and explore prospects of the Eurasian Union. The authors describe and analyze various points of view on the problem. "Eurasian optimists"and "Eurasian skeptics"were identified within this analysis. It was also demonstrated that the leaders and policy makers of the main world states (EU, USA, China) do not have a conceptual opinion on a Eurasian Union project. The reason of such attitude could be attributed to the negative outcomes of the last 20 years integration within the post soviet area. The authors of the article present their own vision of the political and economical prospects of the Eurasian Union. Summing up pros and cons of the Eurasian project the authors come to the conclusion that the position of Eurasian optimists is more justified as a shift from a state-centered system to a global system with regional associations of states as actors is one of the modern trends. Therefore, the Eurasian Union establishment is seen as an objective tendency of the world development.

AB Russia is currently in search of its place and its role in the world. In the conditions of intense relations with the Western states, a political discourse is experiencing the change of priorities in defining a direction of the country's development. Therefore the European vector which served as an orientation point in the political elite in 1990s - the beginning of 2000s, is replaced by the Eurasian one. It is also caused by strengthening the economic and political influence of the Asian states on the international processes. The Eurasian integration project initiated by Russia, finds support among a number of the countries of the post-Soviet territory. The created Eurasian economic union becomes the significant subject of the international political process that gives confidence to Russia as far as its forces in building relations with the Western countries are concerned, as well as the search of self-identity. Russia aspires to become the bridge connecting the West and the East that can serve as its contribution to the creation of equal relations in the global world.
   The article attempts to highlight the trends of modern Russian civilization identification process within the political science discourse. This process is associated with inconsistent implementation of the political, legal, socio-economic and socio-cultural (ideological) projects of society and the state modernization.
   The author focuses on the fact that the center of the discussions in the socio-political discourse is increasingly shifting towards the search of Russian interests not within civilizational projects, but in the search for an independent path of development, which is most fully consistent with the historical destiny of Russia.
   The author substantiates positive and negative factors that contribute to the realization of the Eurasian project aimed at the integration of countries and peoples in the context of the implementation of democratic reforms and the national models of political modernization.

DE Eastern Europe; nationalism; identity; civic nation; political culture;

AB The article investigates nation-building trajectories and civic identity formation in Eastern Europe. The indicated processes in Eastern European states are notably different from those in the Western part of Europe. They are hindered by the specific historical development of these countries and by a set of local characteristics in particular. Quite often, there are such obstacles as unresolved ethnic conflicts and non-involvement of minorities in the building of common political and public practices within the state. The paper aims at assessing the current situation, evaluating international and interethnic regulation practices in the region and their efficiency, working out criteria of a civic nation formation in Eastern European countries. This is, first of all, a question of socio-cultural and political consolidation. Social activism and civic participation are also significant factors. Finally, the very nature of nationalism and the use of the "alien image" in relation to other ethnic groups within the state are important. On this basis, the article proposes a typology of the countries according to the stage of a civic identity formation, and assesses possible future developments.

AB In the introduction part of the article the author gives a proof of the topicality issue, defines the goal and formulates the problem of the research. Variety of theoretical concepts of creativity in various areas, on the one hand, and a practical orientation on the solution of problems - with another, cause a multi-level of knowledge of a creative product. In the main part of the article the author in detail considers the basic levels of scientific knowledge of the relation of so difficult concept as creativity. Within the first level the attention is focused on fundamental studying of production of a product of culture from a position of political and economic approaches, especially approach of the cultural, creative industries. Creativity is the essential feature of cultural goods and services. Many foreign authors consider the cultural benefits as goods. Cultural goods and services - result of the cultural industries are set of economic and cultural values. In general activity in the sphere of the cultural industries is aimed, first of all, at formation and distribution of economic value, without which not exists actually the goods. It, is in turn expressed in such properties of goods as utility, consumption and exchange value. The general that can unite the modern points of view within approach of the cultural, creative industries in understanding of a creative product, - culture as system of values and symbols, at the heart of the assuming the creative beginnings. On a joint of the first and second levels, including applied researches of creativity, there is a culture sociology which is mainly developing in the USA. Weber's tradition of the analysis of "production of culture" is the cornerstone of this approach. The second level of knowledge level, is connected with empirical researches in the field of the cultural industries, namely with questions of the power and an inequality. At the end of the article the author summarizes and concludes. Utility, value, procedurality (production, distribution, exchange and consumption) are the main economic property of the cultural goods. Whereas the possession of a certain form of creativity, existence of symbolical sense, close interrelation with aspects of difficult intellectual work are the main cultural properties of goods of the creative industries.

DE war; the concept of war; the metaphor of war; becoming; the will to
   life; language; Free Spirits
AB The article discusses the role of metaphor and the concept of war in Fr. Nietzsche's texts. The doctrine of the opposition between the Apollonian and Dionisian origins in the culture of ancient Greece is the original context of the war thematization; Nietzsche's analysis of the crisis state of the contemporary world leads to idea of "higher culture" based on violence and war. On the other hand, Nietzsche completely subordinates his style to the metaphor of war: he declares a war on morality, Christianity, compassion; he constantly engages in war with them, identifying himself with the war. Nietzsche's statements are open to different contexts, thus, the images intertwined with concepts acquire depth; the concepts accompanied by images acquire dimension, relief, scale. Metaphor defines the axiological importance of the concept; the concept is a means of expanding the metaphor. The openness of these statements to different contexts often leads to contextual chimeras, combinations of disparate contexts, which in turn leads to an explosion of the language norm, liberation from the power of tradition, a new language. Nietzsche's apology of war is a demonstration of the new philosophy and is located on the other side of good and evil. The "war" stands as the ultimate foundation of the language of life itself, the language of the "Free Spirits".

AB According to the teaching of modern Eastern Orthodox theologians, Eucharistic liturgy brings about a supernatural transcendence beyond the boundaries of time, which allows for an identification of the Eucharist with the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on Calvary. In order to provide a philosophical analysis of the claim, we suggest four different approaches to solving the metaphysical problem of contemporaneity of the two temporally distant events. Two of them exploit the concept of time travel; the third approach establishes the Platonistic relation between the events; the fourth one deals with multilocation of the event in time. Each of the four approaches has its strengths and weaknesses, and each of them requires its followers to make either a theological or a philosophical sacrifice. The whole enterprise of the temporal interpretation of the Orthodox teaching on the Eucharistic sacrifice does not comply with the requirements of analytic metaphysics.

DE Spain; NATO; defense; security; EU; destabilization; North Africa;

AB The article analyzes the changes that have characterized Spain's approach to NATO in the post-Cold War era, and more specifically, the approach of different political parties to security and defense issues. If the People's Party is more Atlantic ideologically and traditionally, and therefore, is more in favor of strengthening cooperation with NATO, the socialists are increasingly pro-European and, therefore, advocate the strengthening of the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP). Spain doesn't question the necessity of NATO, the presence of American military forces in Europe in general and in Spain in particular as a method of security enhancing. Fears of marginalization caused the accession of Spain to this military organization after its eastward extension. In recent years, Spain's influence and authority in NATO declined amid the economic crisis. This loss of authority will be overcome as soon as the economic growth is resumed. Notwithstanding that its ambitions in NATO and EU do not meet its possibilities, Spain is participating in different missions and naval exercises of the Alliance, and is constantly modernizing its military forces. Spain has always been indifferent to the hypothetical threat from the East, but is more than apprehensive to the threat coming from the situation in Libya, instability in Tunisia and especially an eventual destabilization in Morocco where Spanish cities Ceuta and Melilla are situated. Under the pretext of struggle against international terrorism, Madrid is trying to reestablish its influence in North Africa. Spain favors the transformation of NATO into an effective tool to prevent regional conflicts. The country's national interests will continue to determine its attention to problems of the Mediterranean and North Africa. The economic crisis has contributed to a drop in the objective value of bilateral relations with the United States and of transatlantic relations as a whole.

AB The philosophical anthropology under human nature traditionally understood persistent, unchanging features and properties inherent in man at all times, regardless of biological evolution and the historical process. Philosophers, focusing on the analysis of the social nature of man, its cultural conditioning, have developed a number of different interpretations of the concepts of the human essence. However, advances in science and technology allow recently directed transform what was seen as an invariant for millennia - the nature of man. In the context of industrial civilization to society is the problem: Who will be the man, whether there will be inherent in human nature it unchanged constant, not influenced, or its transformation to happen. In connection with the NBIC - technology and questioning about the prospects of a posthuman future, the problem of human nature has acquired a moral and ethical, value measurement. In this case, the absolute duty is to preserve "the ontological idea of man" (H. Jonas).
   It is important to understand the problem of human nature, taking into account advances in technoscience and from the standpoint of the modern historical consciousness, including the idea of global evolutionism. NBIC technologies are not just another scientific and technical development, they "blow up" the world of human life, up to the transformation of the very nature of man, his identity. The article examines how to rethink the identity of the person in connection with the problem of conservation of human nature. The various interpretations of the concept of "identity", such as the measure of his personal, social and cultural. The authors introduce an additional three under consideration a new dimension - natural or ontological dimension of identity.
   That it is the foundation of human self-identity allows him to keep his "essence" in all transformations, is the same basis on which to build human evolution. The natural dimension of human identity is not bound to the substrate, determines its own human, whether soul, mind or spirit, and function with form of activity performed by a human, social practices, to build on a sense of the dignity inherent to the individual. A qualitative change in the nature of man - not the way to improve his abilities and to the destruction of the whole system "Man-Culture-Society."

   ethnocultural identity preservation
AB Emigration of graduates of the Russian higher education institutions abroad has become the constant phenomenon of modern life. Creation of the social mobility conditions by the higher school emphasizes the problem of preserving ethnocultural identity by emigrants and their positive attitude to Russia. The paper shows the results of the field sociological studies (internet poll and focus group) on the graduates of the Russian higher education institutions who currently live in Germany. The objective of these studies has been to investigate the tendencies of a change of the sociocultural and civil identity of the Russian-speaking youth abroad. The wave-like nature of the dynamics of the ethnocultural identification of the 8-year residence abroad is found, and four different models of the behavior of young migrants concerning the sociocultural adaptation and the preservation of ethnocultural identity are described.
   Two characteristics are used as the criteria for the models' identification: "success" and "not success" in the adaptation to the sociocultural life in Germany and a strategy of the preservation of enthocultural identity. Based on them, first, the small group of young migrants who experience problems in the intercultural communication and adaptation and who feel their Russianness, home-sickness is separated. Other three different models of behavior are typical for the young Russian-speaking migrants successful from a standpoint of adaptation but they demonstrate diverse forms of the preservation of enthocultural identity. One of these three groups additionally reveals a negative civil identity to Russia.
   The studies also reveal the negative attitude of the Russian-speaking youth to collective forms of preservation of cultural identity and to the Russian diaspora aged over 50 years old. The forms of the preservation of ethnocultural identity of the youth to a greater extent have individual character with use of modern communicative technologies. The majority of the respondents show a positive relation to Russia, its history and culture. At the same time a part of young migrants state a rejection of the political regime in the Russian Federation and consider a possibility of returning to Russia only after a change of the political regime in the country.

DE Deleuze; ontology; becoming; pointless topology
AB While analyzing Plato's theory of ideas Deleuze claims that it 1) is based on the process of comparing and selection of pretenders and 2) can be "reversed" through presenting this process as an infinite process of becoming never coming to any identity or stability. To build a mathematical model of this philosophy we can take Deleuze's words literally and consider objects together with their comparison to each other on the basis of better or worse conformity to the ideal prototype. This gives us a partial order relation and in this way, we arrive to Heyting algebras or partially ordered sets with special properties. In mathematics these algebras in particular serve as locales in the so-called pointless topology. In this topology, the point is a derivable notion and is defined as ultrafilter. In the context of Deleuze's ontology, the latter plays the role of the transcendent idea - the end of becoming. Thus pointless topology equips us with a theory in which the system of locale's differences "simulates" identities of points. This suggests this topology as a mathematical model of Deleuze's ontology of becoming. This is even more so if we take into account that there are locales without points, which provide us with a model of Deleuzian becoming without end.

DE Gustav Shpet; empathy; phenomenology; problem of the other;
   intersubjectivity
AB The problem of empathy (Einfuhlung) as a part of the question of experience of other minds was one of the most vividly discussed issues in phenomenology in 1910s. Max Scheler stated that other minds can be directly perceived in sympathy or Fremderfahrung. Edith Stein and later Edmund Husserl argued that other minds can be experienced only indirectly, though such experience is original and can not be reduced to any other sort of experience (such as animal life or psychic). Russian phenomenologist Gustav Shpet in his work Appearance and Sense (1914) also develops an original conception of social being. He states that this being as a special ontological region correlates with a specific intuition which he called "social" or "hermeneutical" one and which he differs from empiric and eidetic intuitions. This intuition as the hermeneutical one is the understanding of sense, and as the social one it is none other than empathy. This empathy is not just sympathy or emotional contagion it is the direct experience of the other in his or her concrete being, or it is essentially the perception of the face. So, in this conception of social intuition Shpet appears to be closer to Scheler than to Husserl and Stein, but unlike Scheler he accepts Husserlian transcendental phenomenology, though moving towards a sort of social ontology without subject. Soon after 1910s a long-time decline of the category of empathy began in philosophy in whole. Nonetheless the problem of empathy stayed a "primal landscape" for the question of intersubjectivity in phenomenology. The refusal of empathy as of intermediate experience of the other coincided with the so called "ethical turn" in phenomenology that supposed the infinite inflation of the other becoming the Other from the capital letter and marking the rupture of phenomenality. In contrary, present-day modest renaissance of empathy concurs with the return of interest in the "mere" other. The problem of empathy as it arose in the beginning of the XX century already shapes these oscillations between two contradictory requirements forming a paradox: the experience of the other must not be intermediate, or there'll be no other; and at the same time it must be such, or there'll be no experience. And this paradox appears also in Shpet's conception of social or hermeneutical intuition that is not any given intuition at all and that gives that that slips off its givenness - the intimate sense that is radically outside.

AB The article is devoted to ideological issues in the Turkish party system in the context of the electoral process. The authors analyze the internal content and principles of ideological platforms of the leading parties in Turkey. The formal analysis of party programs allowed to determine the value of the ideology for the functioning of the parties. Besides, analysis of the results of opinion polls conducted by the Turkish public opinion research centers revealed the functionality of ideology in the context of election campaigns. The object of the study was the ideologies of 4 major political parties of Turkey, which entered National Parliament after elections in November 2015. These are conservative Justice and Development Party, the center-left Republican People's Party, the National Movement Party, the Democratic Party of peoples. Analysis of party programs and other official documents showed that all four parties clearly define their ideological identity and political position. However, despite the clarity of such ideological identification, analysis of the last two election campaigns in Turkey revealed a trend among major parties to refuse from the traditional ideological rhetoric and to practice populist methods of voters attracting.
   The paper discloses the contents of the political stratification of Turkish society, depending on the ideological preferences of representatives of various social groups. Causative factors of ideological discourse rise are considered in the context of inter-party competition of leading political forces of the Turkish Republic. A comparative analysis shows that the Republican People's Party and the Nationalist Movement Party are both doctrinal with distinct ideological postulates that have a national base. In contrast, the Justice and Development Party, as well as the People's Democratic Party are more pragmatic and charismatic at the same time.

   ethnic politics; inter-ethnic relations; inter-confessional relations
AB Situations with uncertain developments and results are more often taking place in the world of politics. In this regard, the role of actors who are interested in the implementation of plans for peaceful conflict resolution and non-violence is becoming more urgent. The modern world is replete with situations in which a decision should be made only by qualified intermediaries (mediators), whose purpose is to resolve the conflict by the most effective and painless method.
   This article discusses the main aspects of the technology which is new for the political reality - political mediation as a vital means for solving complex inter-ethnic and inter-confessional problems.
   The author attempts to identify general and specific characteristics of the conflict field that are peculiar for both international and inter-ethnic contradictions arising in the process of multilateral relations of nations with each other and between ethnic groups in multi-ethnic space. At this, the attention is focused on the fact that the conflicts arise out of the contradictions between the interests of these social organisms.
   The article provides the system of argumentation of the thesis that the use of mediation technologies helps to achieve the combination of the parties' autonomy and to guarantee a mutually beneficial result on a common ground. For this purpose the conflicting parties endow a third party with certain powers - the mediator, who is involved in order to look at the conflict from the side and help conflicting actors to get rid of excessive emotion and bias in a dispute.
   Thus, political mediation is a form of alternative expert and political dispute resolution and settlement, voluntarily elected by conflicting communities on the basis of their desire to reach agreement and political objectivity.

DE phenomenology; transcendentalism; hermeneutic dimension; perception as a
   social action
AB What makes Gustav Shpet's work "Appearance and Sense" so important is not only that it was one of the first critical reactions to Husserl's programmatic work of transcendental phenomenology, 1st volume of "Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology". Besides its critical stance, the book retains its actuality in the contexts of ongoing discussionsabout foundations and consequences of "hermeneutic transformation" of the initial phenomenological project. Like Heidegger several years later, Shpet, drawing on research principles Husserl's, has revealed what can be called hermeneutic dimension of perceptual experience. But, unlike Heidegger, Shpet conceders this hermeneutical dimension not as a transcendental fundament but rather as immediate content of visual perception. In other words, experience of perception is not the experience of hiding but that of revealing the hermeneutical, or the teleological in terms of Shpet. Similar understanding of hermeneutical contents we find also in the contemporary - "actionist" - theory of perception, basic elements of which has been presented in the recent works of an American philosopher Alva Noe and a British sociologist Tia DeNora. Nevertheless a sketch of the actionist approach to the phenomenon of perception we can find in programmatic article ("On Multiple Realities") by Alfred Schutz, the founder of phenomenological sociology. As a result, all this creates necessary prerequisites for revisiting theaforementioned Shpet's work from the standpoint alternative to the traditional phenomenological lines of thought. To key innovations within contemporary theories of perception belong the following: consideration of perceptive acts as forms of social action and forms of direct access to the world; the broadening of the concept of understanding to include non-conceptual, practical, bodily, for example sensorimotor,

DE experience; individuality; tragedy
AB In article is formulated the preliminary concept of experience. It is necessary to make a reservation that it is about existential, but not scientific experience: 1) Experience is a reality something single, but not general. General is always a correlate of the sphere of knowledge, but not experience. As "nobility" is the nobility "general and necessary". To have experience is means to deal with singular and accidental. The appeal to experience assumes search of exceptions, search of the facts, search of counterexamples which could call into question the importance of the rule or law. 2) Experience is a sphere new, earlier not meeting, unknown and unexpected. It is unlikely "eternal return same" can be called experience in the true sense of the word. We don't need experience if we know "what order of things" and "at all that it will hardly change". 3) Experience is an experience of passivity, but not a condition of active designing of meanings. Experience of reading, experience of travel, experience of communication always assumes that something opens to me. Experience doesn't assume that I design and I define something by means of various acts. To test experience is to stay in a passive state in the most different meanings of this word. Further in article the analysis of evolution of concept of "experience" in hermeneutics' tradition is carried out. For this purpose some key figures of a mature phase of history of a hermeneutics are chosen: F. Shleiermacher as the representative of romantic tradition, W. Diltey - as the representative of historical tradition, M. Heidegger and G.-G. Gadamer, respectively, - philosophical. In article two lines of evolution of concept of "experience" in hermeneutics' tradition are recorded: 1) F. Shleiermacher's doctrine about others world and other era as infinitely interesting and causing pleasure, but not changing my subjectivity. - W. Diltey's doctrine about change of my subjectivity under the influence of the stranger, but only in imagination. M. Heidegger's doctrine about alien as the internal moment of my ekzistention and fight for an individuation as realization only authentic opportunities for me and to rejection of the alien: but not in imagination, but in being. - G.-G. Gadamer's doctrine about insignificance of my subjectivity and subjectivity of Another in relation to the importance of tradition. 2) Neutral experience of immersion in others subjectivity at F. Shleiermacher. Vital dynamics of suffering - happiness at W. Diltey. - Overcoming of this naive vitality in "being-to-death" as radical individuation at M. Heidegger. - Tragic experience of overcoming of identity through the address to the general and substantive at G.-G. Gadamer.

DE identity; difference; incomprehensible; differance; denial
AB In article some aspects of philosophy of one of the main figures of the Russian religious Renaissance - S. Franc - and one of the brightest representatives of the French post-structuralism - J. Derrida are compared. A subject of the analysis is the mystical and intuitive knowledge set as criticism of ratio and expansion of its borders as the project of need of comprehension "impossible". On the basis of the comparative analysis of construct of "differance" with a concept "incomprehensible" clears up sense of the principle "potentsirovanny denial" as intension of a post-metaphysical discourse. It is shown that the post-metaphysical space of philosophy is a metaphysics "distinction". The aspiration Derrida and Franc is found to express "incomprehensible" in reason language. It is claimed that refusal of the Hegel's dialectic principle "denial denial" leads the Russian philosopher to justification of a "antinomystical monodualism" position and the doctrine about positive ontologic sense and value "denial". The substantial and verbal analysis of the concept "potentiate denial" of the Frank's doctrine is carried out. As a result, the author suggests to consider this concept as a concept anticipation of "the distinguishing distinction" Derrida. The author shows how reflections S. Frank moves in the context of the basic concept of Vl.Solovyov "positive unity", with the result that reinterpreted the Platonic- Pythagorean relationship of being and non-being and establishes the principle of absolute negation. In the opinion of the Russian philosopher, the denial must not only deny but also consolidate various bond. In the context of post-metaphysical philosophical discourse analyzed concepts such as "antinomy", "convergence", "gift", etc. By which S. Frank tries to find a way to overcome the denial meta-logical. In the end, S. Frank manages to comprehend the scope of trans-rational, will not go beyond the rational, without leaving the border area between the subject and that stipulates the terms of this knowledge.

The reviewer describes the specifics of publication, focusing on the fact that the author analyzes in the framework of the political science discourse pressing issues regarding the development of empires as the powers affecting the military-strategic, economic and social aspects. On the pages of his book, Munkler carefully analyzes discussions about the fate and quality of empire in the United States. H. Munkler raises questions about "boundaries of an Empire", including those important subjects that are of great interest to political scientists who study the dynamics of relations between states and other actors in contemporary world politics. The reviewer notes that the author in the book overcomes taboo on imperial discourse in relation to modern democracies, which was initially due to the collapse of the USSR and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, as well as the concepts of liberal democracy triumph.

DE decoration of reality; through concreteness; decorative effect; increase
   in being
AB Article presents the comparative analysis of conceptual understanding of the phenomenon of art in G.G. Shpet's and H.-G. Gadamer's philosophy. Key parameters of the comparative analysis became thematically and substantially close to both thinkers theses on the esthetic transformation of reality in the experience of art, on communication of art with phenomena of game and celebration, on cognitive and ontologic potential of art, and essential interrelation between art and philosophy. Analysis of the celebration- and the game-parameter of artwork showed a fairly significant differences between thinkers. For Gadamer game and festive dimension of art testifies ontologically independent, de-subjectivized and medial character of a work of art, whose way of being - self-presentation, allowing the world and being be fully self-open and self-reveal. Accordingly, the fine is understood not as the effect of the perception of the subject, but as a way of being, representing the universal ontological structure of the world. Shpet's definition of art through the metaphor of "decoration of reality", on the one hand, does not isolate art from life, but, on the other hand, significantly reduces its ontological status. The nature of the interaction between art and life on the model of "active form - passive mate- rial" represents a weak (soft) version of the subject-object model of aesthetic consciousness, which became the hard Gadamer's criticism. In Gadamer's understanding experience of art has the highest cognitive (hermeneutics) potential as it approaches us to original understanding of human being. In Shpet's understanding the thought (idea) have a priority rank and teleologic character, and experience of art, beauty and fine - the secondary, subordinated status. From here partnership between philosophy and art being understood differently: if for Gadamer experience of art ontologically equal to philosophical understanding of being, for Shpet art as "through concreteness", carries out the subordinated aisthesis function on which is built the philosophy as "the last concreteness". Effects of the experience of art for the human being are treated by Shpet in a Hegels paradigm of increase of ranks of reality in process of increase of level of its intelligence. The criticism of synthetic arts and preference of pure classical types of arts (among which literature and poetry are the most perfect), testifies the importance for Shpet of the principle of hierarchy of reflections and correlative to them reality ranks when determining the status and functions of art. In Gadamer's understanding the main mission of art consists in building being-in-the-world. For this reason Gadamer uses expression "increase in being" (Seinszuwachs) in the attitude towards architecture and decorative arts.

ID AUTONOMY
AB The paper submits a formal limitation of the domain of relevant applicability of "Hume's Guillotine" by means of precise definitions of epistemic modalities "a-priori-knowledge-of-being" and "apriori- knowledge-of-value". Logical interconnections between these modalities are graphically modeled by means of the logical square and hexagon. The abstract logical-philosophical corollaries are illustrated by concrete examples from the classical physics. For the first time in the world literature on nature-philosophy the three laws of classical physics, which are well-known as "the ones of Newton", are considered from the viewpoint of two-valued algebra of metaphysics as formal axiology. At the very beginning of the paper the author submits a logical square and hexagon of opposition of epistemic modalities "a-priori knowledge" and "a-posteriori one". The two kinds of knowledge and their contrariness are precisely defined by means of compositions of epistemic, alethic, and axiological modalities. Systematically exploiting the hypothetic-deductive method the author investigates the set of logic consequences of accepting the above-mentioned hypothetical precise definitions of the epistemic modalities "a-priori-knowledge-of-being" and "a-priori-knowledge-of-value" and of the graphic representation of their logical interrelations. Accepting the submitted definitions (and the square-andhexagon- of-opposition) of epistemic modalities implies a set of nontrivial consequences to be examined by comparing with specific materials of concrete sciences. In the present paper the consequences are compared with the material of classical physics, namely, with "the three laws of Newton". Being formally-axiologically interpreted and precisely formulated in terms of two-valued algebra of metaphysics as formal axiology the laws in question have passed the examination successfully: they are (formalaxiological) laws of nature-metaphysics in that special meaning of the term "law" which is precisely defined in two-valued algebra of metaphysics as formal axiology.

DE meaningless expressions; the logical athomism; Russel; Vitgenstein;
   genesis the problem of metaphors; language of philosophy
AB In the article considers question about the origins and factors of formation of the metaphorical problematics in the analytical philosophy. I don't agree that the problem of the analysis of metaphors originated in the pre-war period of analytical philosophy. This view, for example, can be detect (found) in the article Nikonenko (see his article "Analytical interpretation of metaphor"). I think, that researchers, who take this point of view, do not distinguish between the problem of meaningless expressions and, something similar to it, problems of metaphorical using of language. Since the problem of meaningless expressions really originated in the prewar period of analytical philosophy, it might seem that the problem of metaphor originated in the pre-war period too. But it's not true. The problem of metaphor is a completely special research topic. Metaphors cannot be reduced to a meaningless expressions and, so, the problem of metaphorical using of language cannot be reduced to a problem of the meaningless expressions. Metaphor is specifically linguistic phenomenon. its specificity in the fact that metaphors have two structural elements - literal and, conditionally, non-literal (for example, implied). We can call them, for example - "literal meaning" and "implied sense", "tenor" and "vehicle, "metaphor's focus" and "frame", etc. It is believed, that metaphors do not refer to non-linguistic objects and, thus, they are kind of empty names. But why they often are used in naming of phenomena (objects) that have not yet designations in language? Why are metaphors used in science and philosophy, including in analytical philosophy? For example, we can remember metaphors in the theory of Russell - "logical atom", "molecular sentence". Vitgensteins metaphors : "the logical picture of the world", "the world of facts", "language as border of thinking" and so on. Marguerite La Caze in her "The Analytic Imaginary" also writes about metaphors, that used in analytical philosophy. Can we then say that metaphors are kind of empty names, which, moreover, must be eliminated from strictly language? This position is dangerous to themselves analytical theories - for example, the conception of the logical athomism. It turns out that it consists of empty names? What to do in this case Russell or Vitgenstein? I think, analytics should to consider metaphors more carefully and deeply and we must understand, that metaphors have many different and useful for science functions. However, this happened in the postwar period in the genesis of analytic philosophy.

DE distributive knowledge; Early Modern metaphysics
AB Gustav Shpet notes that when we say "I", we unwittingly fall into homonymy: it is one thing to assert something, directly related to speaker, the other - to use mathematical statements, which have not any "subject" of assertion. This ability of statements - to be shared by others, we call distributive knowledge. The task of the article is to present a classification of distributive ideas. If it is obvious that the statements of type 2 x 2 = 4 are of one type, namely, of universal and necessary distribution, then what are other classes of distribution? Knowledge is what is distributed, the circulation of knowledge is a necessary feature of any kind of knowledge. One can not, therefore, to posses the knowledge, the only possibility is to share it. However, the fact that knowledge is distributed entity does not means that any type of knowledge is distributed by the same way. Classification of distributive knowledge can be built on different bases, first of all on a degree of universality: singular distribution, particular and universal. But also there are ideas that con be shared by nobody, even by uttering. Therefore, there is zero distribution. And we can point out on negative forms of distribution. The latter can also be specified by the degree of universality. The article traces the way in which the idea of the distribution of knowledge implicitly presented in Early modern metaphysics, it regards the elements of Bacon, Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz doctrines. The special emphasis is on the Leibniz' one: the world of monads, at first glance, actually excludes any distributive knowledge, for every monad is essentially individual. Yet it is in Leibniz we find many elements of a distributive theory of knowledge. We mean Leibniz' special interpretation of innate ideas and the point where imperceptible transformations in conscious perceptions. In conclusion we point out that the concept of distributive knowledge was not fully manifested and, due to the Kantian critique of knowledge, was screened by the concept of objectivity.

DE bioethics; symbolism; image
AB The article is answering to question do proliferation of bioethics' images and philosophical researches take place. The answer is based at review of philosophical researches of modern culture published during the last 3 years at "Tomsk State Pedagogical University Bulletin". The magazine is not dedicated to philosophy so the set of reviewed articles was selected on random basis. By its content articles are grouped by: 1) their direct relation to bioethics; 2) their indirect relation to bioethics (articles finding in bioethics example to demonstrate results of their sociocultural transformation research); 3) their relation to research of transformations of modern reality images (science, communicative complexity, game, memory). For articles of the 1st group it was proved that bioethics focus its efforts on "protection of individuality" (T.Mescheryakova). In articles of the 2nd group bioethics appears as response of culture to unified pressure of new technologies and as response of science to request of modern culture for creation of methods of any individuality protection (particular person, embryo, animal, hybrid forms of life). Analysis of the 3rd group content allowed to reveal correlation between articles. It is based at extinction of "borders between the natural and the social, the organic and the humane" (I. Inishev), "the social and the individual" (N. Smirnova). Attitudes of bioethics are corresponded to research of images that are "living" in communicative complexity of modern culture's playing reality. Element of randomness in selection of articles reveals trajectories of mutual proliferations of bioethics' symbolism and modern reality images in research of culture - from bioethics to comprehension of "individuality" and "norm" images' essence and from phenomena of modern culture's anthropologic conformations to its manifestations in bioethics. Analysis of methodological approaches implemented at all reviewed articles allowed to define set of respectable approaches to research of bioethics' symbolism: philosophical hermeneutics, semiotics and synergy. Condition of these approaches' integration was defined - acceptance of procedural interpretation of the event (A.N. Whithehead) which allows to reveal semiotic and synergetic mechanisms of "revolution in symbolism".

DE bioethics; individuality; identity
AB Revealing of causes of bioethics' emergence allows not only to trace history of new science discipline formation, its genesis but also to formulate the main purpose of bioethics - protection of human rights and dignity via protection of human individuality. Besides the question is very individual-ity not personality or identity. Personality does not change and individuality is entirely under the threat of its modification (that cause its loss when its unique, individual features disappear) or direct destruction, annihilation (as in the event of artificial abortion - an embryo is not a personality in the true sense of the word but exist as a human individuality already). Striking instance of losing individuality is face transplantation. It impossible to replace "individuality" concept with "identity". Individuality is totality of human features. Being "a fragile property of personality" (S. Benkhabib), individuality does not coincide with identity because identity suppose an attitude of individual to himself, describe his affiliation with some community. Targeting bioethics on individual caused by epistemological features of medicine and specifics of bioethical problems emerging as a result of some biomedical technology application as well as by medicalization of culture. Medicine deals with individual phenomena, its objects are individual cases, situations and documents. Epistemological features of medicine spring from this stipulated by gap of "two cultures" in it on the one hand and dual nature of medical knowledge (as nomothetic and ideographic science) on the other hand. In turn it actualize in bioethics a patient's individuality in its different manifestations. In bioethics individuality possess all features of historical individuality: it is indivisible and cannot be divided in composite parts, it has temporality and development, it is an element of social organization. Comprehension of individuality as historical individuality allow to define borders of human existence in more clear way and reveal a place and significance of bioethics in solving problem of individuality protection.

DE projection; clang; listening; graphical notation
AB Phenomenology of logical space in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and in "Some Remarks on Logical Form" by Ludwig Wittgenstein faces the necessity to give the definition of objects, being simultaneously starting points and endpoints of the procedure of the logical analysis of language. Juxtaposition of two divergent interpretations of Tractarian objects - 'atomist' and 'wholist' ones leads to indication of two principal attitudes towards the world, both of which derived from the acceptance of corresponding interpretations. Parallelism between the ambiguity of the attitude towards the world in Tractatus and divergence of composing practice strategy in P. Boulez and J. Cage is mentioned: technical improvement of the musical material against allowance for sounds to be themselves, i.e. to be anything. Phenomenological interpretation of Tractarian objects allows to give them definition 'anything', for anything can become simple object in the Tractatus. Comparing the notion of the object as anything with theoretical works by J. Tenney shows that any sound can be clang (unit of understanding "contemporary music"), hence the border between the musical and the non-musical vanishes. The breakdown of the border between music and sound implies the possibility of extrapolation of the projection principle from the Tractarian symbolism to the musical one, which is considered with the example of composition "Treatise" by C. Cardew, where the graphical notation leaves space for determination of the relationship between score and sound produced to the musician-performer. Thus inner relation between sign and corresponding sound is splitting, and there only remains possibility to understand music as unpredeterminated, unprescribed and hence any.

AB The article studies the basic and complicated evolution of different approaches for investigating Russian post-Soviet Islamic transformation. The authors describe the logic and dynamic of scrutinizing such kind of problems as Islamic consciousness and Muslim institutes, relationships between Islam and ethnic political develoments, forms and manifestations of Islamic fundamentalism. In an effort to identify and assess the signs of post-Soviet Islamic revival, the Russian academic community has obviously been driven to despair. Especially since the tragedy of 9/11/2001 as a source of studying Islam as an evasive object. The main goal of this paper is the methodological innovation which consists in multilayered approach. The authors argue that changes of parameters and structure of post-Soviet policy is reflected in the change of format and unities of analysis. The paper examines the character of academic discussion about different understanding of such political phenomena as politization of Islam as well as bordering Islam in terms of multi-level methodology. This methodology could be able to clarify very complicated Islamic features: socio-territorial organization, communication, and the reproduction channels. It alone will help us explain changing Islam as a social and political enigma. In this paper the authors have correctly identified the phenomenon of Muslim regionalization as a situation under which the Islamic leaders concentrate on religious development at the local level. It is not the authors' aim to discuss the forms of Islamic existence and its religious-teaching component. The authors favor the wider approach typical of political science in which there is a component of Islamic studies. This analysis has demonstrated that the multi-layered approach to Islam, which identifies its viable segments, has a considerable heuristic potential. This approach helps to understand the inner dynamics of the Islamic development as a complex social and political phenomenon. This reconfirms the old truth that the deeper the analysis goes into the past the more integral an image of reality it acquires.

DE Wittgenstein; action; will
AB In this paper, I review and discuss the philosophy of action in Wittgenstein's later works. In the first part, I discuss Wittgenstein's criticism of the variety of contemporary theories in the philosophy of action: the theory of innervation, the ideomotor theory of action of William James, the "trying" theory of action. Key intuitions in Wittgenstein's criticism can be summarized in three points: 1) Action has an active as opposed to passive quality as it is given in our experience; 2) action is not produced by some kind of means, action has no prior phenomenal causes; 3) we know what movements are our actions. The first group denotes the property of "activeness", the second one denotes "non-causal" property of actions, and the third one denotes the property of "authorship". In the second part, I develop these intuitions. The problem goes as follows: how can we explain the property of "activeness" and the property of "authorship" of action without introducing in our account the phenomenally given antecedents of action? I propose to divide two types of action. Those actions that are done without much thought in everyday life (automatic), and those actions that occur with a high concentration of attention and deliberation (problematic). Further, I propose to consider the theory of action that is based on the following assumptions: real causes of action can not be given in experience. We should analyze the action as having two components: 1) a phenomenal and 2) non-phenomenal. The phenomenal component of action is what we can observe as the action like the bodily movements or the mental actions. Non-phenomenal includes the causes of this phenomenal part. There are two possible meanings of "non-phenomenal" causes of action. The first approach is naturalistic: the actions have unconscious physiological processes in our body (more precisely - in our brains) as their causes. These processes produce the relevant experience of authorship and activity. The alternative approach is the "transcendentalist's" agent-cause: the cause of action is the transcendental will, which cause the phenomenal "action". The agent is the will and exists as the agent only when he wills, i.e. when he is doing something.

AB This article analyzes the views of G. Shpet on the problems of the nation and nationalism, as well as his a broader approach to the understanding of social space. At the beginning of the study reconstructed the concept of "narod" in the Shpets theory, which is a function of social emotions expressed in the changes of connotative meanings. In the understanding of the social use of language reveals the continuity of the concept of neo-Kantianism Shpet (Humboldt-Cassirer), Durkheim, Parsons, Weber, Husserl and Bakhtin. The article shows that Shpet is one of the founder of new methodological position, proclaiming the necessity of situational and contextual approach to the concept of "nation". This is opposed to a universal theory of nationalism, as well as the notion of "national idea" related to the understanding of the nation as a organism. Understanding of the nation depends on the historically conditioned system of oppositions. It allows confronts the myth of natural oragnic nation building. The article emphasizes the connection Shpets position to modern sociological theories (Anderson, Bourdieu) in terms of understanding the "nation" as a social construct and the product of symbolic manipulation. Shpet opposes substantialistic understanding this category, considering it as a volatile form of cataloging, as well as against the nominalist relativism, which reduces the diversity of the social world to the theoretical constructs. Shpet adheres to the principles of real social typology, and also rejects the homogeneous nature of the social space. The article shows Shpet formation of a new understanding of the social space in which the categories of perception of the social world are products of inclusiveness objective structures of this space. It is emphasized that in their theoretical views on these issues Spet avoided the ideological fervor, proclaiming no bias and methodological rigor of social science.

AB The article deals with a study of the problems with the definition of freedom by the means the analytic philosophy of language on an example of Isaiah Berlin's concept of freedom of. Certain critical arguments against his approach, their strengths and weaknesses, are represented. As it is known, the idea of distinguishing between a negative and a positive sense of the term "freedom" goes back at least to Kant, and was examined and defended in depth by Isaiah Berlin in the 1950s and '60s. Discussions about positive and negative freedom normally take place within the context of political and social philosophy. They are distinct from, though sometimes related to, philosophical discussions about free will. Work on the nature of positive liberty often overlaps, however, with work on the nature of autonomy. As Berlin showed, negative and positive freedom are not merely two distinct kinds of freedom; they can be seen as rival, incompatible interpretations of a single political ideal. Since few people claim to be against liberty, the way this term is interpreted and defined can have important philosophical implications. It has also suggested that the idea of distinguishing between a negative and a positive sense of the term of freedom is for the several reasons ineffective.

AB Ilya Pavlov's article searches the aspects of L. Wittgenstein's philosophical heritage, which can help researcher to find the new fruitful strategies for interpretation Wittgenstein's philosophy in general. Author emphasized that Wittgenstein's reflections on the music are one of these aspects because they helps to see how philosopher's ethical, cultural and religious concepts correlates with published works on analytical philosophy of language. For this research author uses L. Wittgenstein's notes "Culture and Value". In this source author analyzes philosopher's point of view on the great European composers as well as his reflections on the compositional technique, the musical form and the music. Then the paper deals with more general Wittgenstein's thoughts about the religion, culture, nations and the historical path of the Europe, which can be found in notes "Culture and Value". Author considers these general metaphysical ideas to be linked with the analogical places in Wittgenstein's notes and his published works "Logical-Philosophical Treatise" and "Philosophical Investigations", which demonstrate the correlation between the functions of the musical language and the natural language of people's everyday communication. Wittgenstein's judgments about the composers are analyzed not in order of appearance in the text of notes "Culture and Value", but in chronological order. So, chaotic notes of philosopher are grouped together in systematic review of European culture's history. Basing on the quotes from Wittgenstein's notes, author demonstrates the analogies in wittgensteinian description of polyphonic language of baroque music and solemn one of romantic music of XIX century. Both, they are some compositional techniques which can express the musical composition's spirit irreducible to this technique (Bach, Beethoven) as well as only develop empty musical form (Mendelssohn, Shubert). This irreducible spirit can't be analyzed. It designates that language of the music as well as the natural language in its everyday practice are based on people immediate life and the characters of the persons. Analysis of music, language and its understanding by human faces many philosophical problems because the human life can't be reduced to formal schemes and techniques. At the same time, these techniques (such as counterpoint) can't be abstracted from existential and metaphysical aspect of the life.

As a rule, the main tool for interpretation of another's speech and behavior - attitude of holding-true a sentence - escapes our attention in conversation. The reason for this is largely due to the fact that the requirement for a holistic approach to our beliefs depends on the semantic indeterminacy of translation. Author of the article suggests that widened understanding of semantical anomalies can clarify why sentential structure of propositional attitudes usually escapes our attention.

DE protests; social movements; identity; anti-language; sociolinguistics
AB Analysis of language practices of Russian protesters in the winter 2011-2012 revealed that state of art in Russian sociolinguistics is missing a concept that can be used as an adequate definition for these practices. Sarcastic, metaphorical, humorous language of protesters received phenomenal attention of social scientists but mostly in a sociological prospective as a tool of middle class self-manifestation. Attempts to classify this language phenomenon were very limited. Nevertheless, the similarities between winter 2011-2012 protest discourse and language shifts accompanying revolutions are rather apparent. Even though, revolutionary discourse is apparently an extreme case of social 're-construction' of reality, "carnavalesque" protest language formed in the winter 2011-2012 has properties and features resembling it. Albeit a fact that Russian sociolinguistics was heavily formed during revolution in the beginning of the 20th century, the unified concept for revolution's language definition was not crystallized. Present article proposes to use a concept "anti-language" introduced by British sociolinguist M.A.K. Halliday as a proxy for description of protest and revolutionary language. Author is distinguishing the main features of "anti-language" and analyzing protest discourse of the winter 2011-2012 in order to find them. The conclusion is that this concept is more appropriate definition for protest and revolutionary discourse than terms generally accepted in Russian linguistics (e.g. jargon, sociolect, etc.). In future will be established links between concepts of anti-language (Halliday), carnavalesque (Bakhtin) and social construction of reality (Berger and Luckmann). Based on that Halliday's concept of anti-language will be refined and complemented.

TI MORAL FEELING AS THE FOUNDATION OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF MORALITY

   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE knowledge; moral feeling; Hume; Kant; Wittgenstein
AB In this article I would like to present a hypothesis about how knowledge is organized. My main aim is to show that moral feeling plays a significant role in the process of cognition. Since knowledge in the field of morality seems the most problematic one, we begin with it. The difficulty here lies in the fact that in moral sphere knowledge does not have such a reliable foundation as empirical facts. It seems that there can be only two possible variants of moral foundations, i.e. historical ones and those which consider morality to be transcendent. The former presupposes a notion that morality is just a result of a chain of causes and effects. According to the second interpretation morality does not depend on any phenomena of experience. Apart from discussing the dispute between these two theories of the foundation of morality, we are to notice one important thought, which came to the fore within the framework of the historical way of explaining the emergence of morality. This well expressed by Hume idea is that some personal attitude is necessary for making a certain norm valuable for a subjective will. In the case of transcendent morality this idea is to become a significant problem. It is intuitively clear in this situation to suggest that there should be some "moral" feeling, which differs from other senses by its principal autonomy from the purpose of self-adaptation to the reality. It would be absurd to accept any immoral feelings here for such a role, because in that case following moral claims would be just a contingency. Such idea was close to Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, who supposed that there was some extra moral feeling, such as "a sense of the common good" or "sympathy to others" which guided a person to the moral law. However, it seems that such a salvation is not quite satisfactory and some more specification is needed for moral feeling to be an appropriate solution of the mentioned problem. To understand the otherness of moral feeling I will make a comparison of moral and immoral feelings in the sphere of how motivation works. A good example in such a case is Kantian philosophy and its problem of relation between moral motivation and sensual affects. One of the contemporary researchers, Allen Wood suggests an interesting way out of this debate. According to him, only those good actions can really have moral value, which are presupposed by a deliberate decision. Allen Wood states a very significant idea that morality in its full sense is not possible without a struggle of different motives, without choice. It seems clear that a struggle can occur between congenerous phenomena. In such a case, moral feeling should be a part of phenomenal world like other affects and its triumph should become a result of a relation of all these motivational forces. However I try to show that both such statements are absurd. In the end I ask one simple question: how an attitude to eat an apple differs from an attitude for the world to have its sense? In my opinion, a good answer to it gives us Wittgenstein claiming that an independence of virtues from facts. And finally we came to the main statement I am arguing for in this article that moral feeling which is necessary for any choice, i.e. for any moral knowledge, is not to be considered as a phenomenon, as an object of research.

DE categorical imperative; Immanuel Kant; moral dilemma; principalism;
   particularism; moral principle; moral duty; holism; contextualism
AB The article discusses a possible solution to a moral dilemma Kant formulated in the light of the polemic between generalists and particularists. Issue is broadly discussed by modern English-speaking scholars. Generalists insist on the decisive role of moral principles in determining morally relevant properties or relations and correctness of our actions. Particularists argue that morality of certain characteristics is determined by the context; thus, an agent's appeal to moral principles for understanding of particular cases is ill founded. It is alleged that a possible solution to the problem requires a redefinition of the nature and role of the principle. It is argued that no principle can be applied directly. The principle is designed to generally differentiate between the moral and the non-moral and direct the search for morally significant features and correct actions. Therefore, principle application needs its interpretation (e.g., what means "to treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, never as a means only but always at the same time as an end") and specification (what actions should be implemented in a given situation for all participants to be treated as an end in themselves, not a means). Then the requirement of unconditionality refers only to the principle. Any specific norm or action will always be conditioned. It seems that the proposed interpretation of the nature and role of the principle provides a methodology for solving the dilemmas of the Kantian type: should one lie to a murderer to save the life of a third person. If the principle requires treating any rational human being as an end, not a means, it is proved that in this context it is lying that provides for treating all the participants of the situation as an end.

   factor analysis
AB In Hungary, during 2010-2015 the growing xenophobic attitudes are noticed in the society, and right radical extremist groups gain power. The aim of the article is to identify the most significant factors that encourage xenophobia in Hungary. The types of right organizations and their electoral performance are determined. Our hypothesis is that the activity of right extremist organizations influences the formation of xenophobic social practices in Hungary. By means of factor analysis the author identified the main directions and forms of activity of right radicals, determined the value of socio-economic dynamics of Hungary, characterized the attitudes of society, the law and the ruling elite to the problems of xenophobia and right radicalism. Among the most influential factors we should name: open propaganda of nationalist ideas; constitutional priority to the interests of ethnic Hungarians; parliamentary membership of the Movement "For a Better Hungary"; condoning by the ruling elite, the courts and the police of the right radical activity.
   The paper presents the trend in the contemporary Hungary: the public demonstrates intolerance to right radicalism in cases of criminal behavior, but for the most part is loyal to its ideologies. Except for oppositional human rights organizations and ethnic communities, a significant part of Hungarian society often shows nearly complete indifference to the issues of xenophobia, racial and ethnic discrimination.
   The author described five groups of factors that stimulate the reproduction of xenophobic attitudes and practices among various groups of the population: "historical", institutional, socioeconomic, legal and political.
   The paper uses empirical data of public opinion polls conducted by leading research centers in Hungary, as well as statistical data of public authorities, civil society institutions.

AB On the basis of recent studies of modern ethno-political processes the author shows the new threats and challenges of uncontrolled migration flows from the Middle East and North Africa. These processes have created a serious threat not only to EU countries but also in other continents. The author analyzes and forecasts the growing conflict potential in the Caspian region, which is particularly applied to Southern Russia. On the basis of a comparative analysis of the old and the modern conflicts, the author makes conclusion about the continuity of data due to the lack of development of negative processes of democratic processes and the low level of tolerance in the regions of the North Caucasus, which is a breeding ground for Islamic radicalism. The only constructive solution to this problem in the present period is the socio-economic stabilization of the society and the revival of the principles of tolerance since the Soviet period, taking into account regional peculiarities of the peoples living in these territories.
   As a result, it is necessary to provide recommendations and suggestions of scientists, economists and social scientists to expand intellectual scientific potential with a degree of respect for the principles of tolerance.
   In conclusion it is noted that today for Russia there cannot be a future without policy capable of ensuring harmony in inter-ethnic and religious relations, the cooperation of all constituent peoples.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Transatlantic relations; Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
   Agreement between the EU and the USA; the EU army; cooperation between
   Germany and Russia
AB The article investigates approaches taken by major political parties and civil society in the FRG toward the transatlantic partnership. It reveals the tendencies of the prospective promotion of Berlin's cooperation with Washington; the article also gives a forecast of further interaction between the EU and the USA, indicates the direction of discourse regarding the future Russia-Germany relations model in the context of the Ukrainian crisis and in reference to the increased transatlantic solidarity. Disputes in German socio-political circles on the issue of the FRG's policy toward the U.S. are emerging all the time, but they have to be considered within a concrete historical and political context. Being of primary significance for all German chancellors, the transatlantic factor has been shaping itself in a controversial way as to the nation's public opinion. This has been confirmed by many opinion polls, including the survey on the signing of the EU-U.S. Agreement on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Chancellor A. Merkel is playing an important role: she is either ascribed full compliancy with Washington, or is being tentatively shown as a consistent government figure in advancing and upholding of Germany and the EU interests. A. Merkel has implemented her peace-seeking drive in undoing the Ukrainian tangle by setting up the "Normandy format" involving the leaders of Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine while having cleared it through with the U.S. President B. Obama well in advance. Despite the increasing criticism of Washington's policy among some part of Germans, for the majority of German voters, the USA remains a country of implementable hopes, the only power in the world possessing a high education level and the most advanced technologies. Americans, for their part, are confident of the important role that Berlin plays in world politics, particularly in what concerns the maintenance of unity within the EU. Berlin aims at further constructive interaction with the USA in the frame of NATO as well as within other transatlantic formats. Notwithstanding the steady tendency toward increasing of the Washington policy's critical perception degree in German society, officially Berlin continues as Washington's true ally, partner and friend. There is every reason to believe that after the 2017 Bundestag elections, the new (the former) Chancellor will have to face a modernized transatlantic partnership philosophy, with a paradigm also devised in the spirit of the bloc discipline and commitments to allies. The main concern for Berlin is not to lose its sovereign right of decision-making, including the one that deals with problems of European security and relations with Moscow. Regrettably, Germany is not putting forward any innovative ideas on aligning a new architecture of European security with Russia's participation. Meanwhile, German scholars and experts are trying to work out a tentative algorithm of a gradual return to the West's full-fledged dialog with Russia, which, unfortunately, is qualified as an opponent by many politicians. Predictably, the Crimea issue will remain a long-lasting political irritant in relations between Russia and Germany. Although not every aspect of Berlin's activation in its foreign policy finds support of the German public, and the outburst of anti-American feeling is obvious, experts believe that the government of the FRG is "merely taking stock of these phenomena and ignores them". Evident is the gap between the government's line and the feeling of the German parties' basis, the public.
   It is noteworthy that the FRG has not yet adopted the Law on Holding General Federal Referendums on key issues of the domestic and foreign policy. There is every indication to assume that the real causes of abandoning the nation-wide referendums are the reluctance of the German ruling bureaucracy and even its apprehensions of the negative voting returns on sensitive problems, - such as basic documents and decisions of the EU, the export of German arms, relations with the U.S., etc. The harmony between Berlin's "Realpolitik" and German public opinion is not yet discernible within the system of transatlantic axes.

   policy; security policy; European Union; NATO
AB The erosion of the socioeconomic "Swedish model" and the reduction of non-alignment in the national foreign policy has been and is taking place in history and politics simultaneously, exerting a fatal mutual interaction. The derived deviations are leading to a radical alteration of Sweden's image, of its previous national and international specificity. The degradation of the "Swedish model" has been taking place as a result of activity of intrinsic forces and factors closely connected with structural social problems, matters of national economy efficiency and adaptation to world economy requirements, to processes of globalization. The general destructive transformation, a big number of qualitative doctrinal and institutional changes taking place since 1990s till now in the framework of the "Swedish model" is also linked with the condition of internal strife and alignment of party-political forces in the country, aiming at finding an adequate answer to new challenges of the 21st century. The events of Ukrainian crisis (particularly concerning Crimea and Donetsk Basin) apparently influenced Sweden, politically resounding with a known painful historical "Poltava syndrome". Although the incorporation of Sweden (as well as that of other small Nordic states) in European regional and Nordic subregional integration processes reflects the principal objective economic trend to internationalization of the world economy, the forms, rates and prospects of political integration into the EU sometimes generate objections, resistance and even disapproval of state institutions by a part of society in connection with external as well as internal socioeconomic reasons (particularly in terms of the "Swedish model" acute agenda). The loss of the famous features of Sweden's international policy, especially after its accession to the European Community/European Union, as well as its leveling led to the loss of the original political role of the country in the Northern subregion and in Europe at large. Immanent undermining, washing out of fundamental guarantees in the Swedish policy of neutrality pushes Stockholm forward to shameless convergence with Euro-Atlantic partners and their alliances - the EU and NATO. To all appearance, a complicated search is going on in the country - the search of a new socioeconomic model, of the foreign policy and the national security policy modification.

AB This paper represents the second part of the previously published article. It covers Great Britain's role in generating of a consolidated international view on Russia's influence on the Ukrainian crisis during Petr Poroshenko's presidency (2014-2015), further explores the worsening of bilateral relations between the UK and Russia in a wide context of antagonism between the U.S. and Russia. The author also investigates Britain's role in imposing of the gravest economic sanctions on Russian economy after the Malaysian aircraft crush, and their impact on the Western countries' economies, especially on the British economy key industries. The attention is given to popularity of Vladimir Putin and his policy in Russian society and business community, which rose after the introducing of western sanctions. The article examines the damage done to cooperation between Russian and British business by deterioration in bilateral political relations. Assessing the scope of this damage, the author notes that for quite a long time Britain disinclined to start a new Cold War with Russia. The author further scrutinizes the impact of the Ukrainian crisis on strengthening of Anglo-American "special relations", on the revival of the NATO's strategic task of being a tool to hamper Russia's influence in the world: for this purpose joint military exercises in the Baltic region were organized, and special NATO Response Force was created. The main questions raised in this research are: when can the UK-Russia relations become better again, and what can help improve the relationship between two countries?

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Germany; U.S.; EU; NATO; transatlantic relations; security policy;
   Russia; Ukraine
AB Relations between Germany, the U.S. and NATO today are the core of transatlantic links. After the Cold War and the reunification of Germany, NATO has lost its former importance to Germany which was not a "frontline state" anymore. The EU acquired a greater importance for German politicians applying both for certain political independence and for establishing of a broad partnership with Russia and China. The task of the European Union Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) development has been regarded by Berlin as a necessary component of the NATO's transformation into a "balanced Euro-American alliance", and the realization of this project - as the most important prerequisite for a more independent foreign policy. Germany's refusal to support the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 led to the first serious crisis in U.S.-Germany relations. At the same time, there was no radical break of the deeply rooted Atlanticism tradition in German policy. It was Angela Merkel as a new head of the German government (2005) who managed to smooth largely disagreements in relations with the United States. Atlanticism remains one of the fundamental foreign policy elements for any German government, mostly because Berlin's hope for deepening of the European integration and transition to the EU CFSP seems unrealistic in the foreseeable future. However, there is still a fundamental basis of disagreements emerged in the transatlantic relationship (reduction of a military threat weakening Berlin's dependence from Washington, and the growing influence of Germany in the European Union). According to the federal government's opinion, Germany's contribution to the NATO military component should not be in increasing, but in optimizing of military expenses. However, taking into account the incipient signs of the crisis overcoming in the EU, and still a tough situation around Ukraine, it seems that in the medium-term perspective one should expect further enhancing of Germany's participation in NATO military activities and, therefore, a growth in its military expenses. In Berlin, there is a wide support for the idea of the European army. However, most experts agree that it can be implemented only when the EU develops the Common Foreign and Defense Policy to a certain extent. The U.S.-Germany espionage scandals following one after another since 2013 have seriously undermined the traditional German trust to the United States as a reliable partner. However, under the impact of the Ukrainian conflict, the value of military-political dimension of Germany's transatlantic relations and its dependence on the U.S. and NATO security guarantees increased. At the same time, Washington expects from Berlin as a recognized European leader a more active policy toward Russia and in respect of some other international issues. In the current international political situation, the desire to expand political influence in the world and achieve a greater autonomy claimed by German leaders seems to Berlin only possible in the context of transatlantic relations strengthening and solidarity within the NATO - the only military-political organization of the West which is able to ensure the collective defense for its members against the external threats. However, it is important to take into consideration, that not only the value of the United States and NATO for Germany, but also the role of Germany in the North Atlantic Alliance as a "representative of European interests" has increased. The role of Germany as a mediator in establishing the West-Russia relations remains equally important.

TI THE CONCEPT OF CHRISTIAN SOCIALISM AS A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SOCIAL
   IDEAL IN THE WORKS OF S.N. BULGAKOV

LA Russian
DT Article
DE social ideal; Christianity; socialism; Christian socialism; religion;
   social problem
AB In several modern philosophic and socio-philosophic publications one can see the renewed tendency to somehow connect secular and religious approaches to the analysis of social reality that also prevailed in Russian philosophy. The necessity of re-thinking of the established value system, particularly moral ideals, in accordance with the changes in the social medium justifies the relevancy of adverting to the history of Russian philosophy. The study of Russian spiritual and intellectual heritage plays a substantial role in the process. The subject of the article analysis is the religious and philosophic views of S.N. Bulgakov on the issue of the social ideal in the context of the concept of Christian socialism. S.N. Bulgakov was one of the few representatives of the religious philosophic thought of the end of the 19th - beginning of the 20th centuries who tried to combine socialism as a socio-economic doctrine with the religious and moral sense of the society on the basis of Christian social ethics. As part of the study the author examined the works of S.N. Bulgakov based on the idea of Christian socialism, such as A Pressing Task (1905), Karl Marx as a Religious Type (1906), Christianity and the Social Issue (1906), Two Cities (1911), Light Unfading (1917), The Soul of Socialism (1937) and several other works. The uniqueness of Bulgakov's philosophic viewpoint is that the central idea of his concept is the religious focus. S.N. Bulgakov considered Christian socialism as a derivative of the spirit of Orthodoxy, and tried to address the social issues of his time from the Christian point of view. S.N. Bulgakov strongly believed that Christian socialism can and should bring the gospel to the modern society, that it is designed to create a new dimension in the public conscience based on exceptional freedom and acceptance of human rights. The philosopher regards Christian socialism as a globally valid public ideal with a universal philosophic and ethical doctrine preaching moral responsibility of a person not only for oneself, but for all the society at large. The analysis of the ideological legacy of S.N. Bulgakov can be explained by the assonance of the problems he addresses in his works with the problems that are now being discussed in the modern science and philosophy with new acuteness. This problem assonance is defined by the significant similarity of the socio-political and spiritual-cultural state at the end of the 19th - beginning of the 20th centuries and the present.

AB The article examines U.S.-France relations, in particular within the NATO framework, as well as positions of France in the Alliance, its participation in NATO operations and its desire to play a more active role in this organization. The pilot of American interests in the Asian-Pacific region and events in Ukraine revive aspirations of Europeans for more active building of the "European defense". The France-Britain military collaboration is developing intensively. However, France considers the formation of the "European army" as a question of a very long-term perspective. The article also examines the stance of France on the free trade zone between the EU and the U.S. The Atlantic solidarity is one of the most important directions in the French foreign policy. In power, Francois Hollande continues his predecessor's policy in this sphere. Nowadays, France demonstrates the accordance with the U.S. almost in all international issues from Syria to Ukraine. France has shown its dependence on the U.S. policy in such questions as "Mistrals" delivery to Russia and the attitude to the Ukrainian crisis. The scandal around the American ANB spying after French political and business elite did not destroy this dependence. The participation of France in NATO is the most important format of transatlantic relations. The French expert association and opposition forces constantly criticize the transatlantic direction of Hollande's foreign policy. The greater and greater part of French elite stands for the returning of an independent voice of France in international affairs. The great anxiety in French society is provoked by the U.S. pulling into the crusade against Russia. However, in the present situation, French leaders are not going to spoil relations with their transatlantic partner, because they believe that only together with the U.S. they can counter contemporary challenges of the modern world.

TI VALUES SURVEY: THE SPECIFICITY OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE values; hard technique; soft technique; measurement; detection
AB relevance of the study is due to the global transformation of values in society in recent years. With changing eras some values disappear and new ones appear. Stable values with the change of epochs change their semantic content. One must keep track of these changes. The most popular methods of studying values are standardized, rigid methods, e.g., a technique of social psychologist M. Rokeach. It is based on respondents' direct ranking two lists of values: terminal and instrumental (each list includes 18 values). This technique is universal. It is assumed that all the 36 values in it are common to all cultures and all social groups. We insist on the fact that different ages, different socio- political periods in the country are characterized by different values for different social and status groups. We believe that a research tool / method is necessary and possible to help researchers move closer to an adequate understanding of the values that guide people, and senses people make by various judgments. We propose the method of open questions for studying value orientations. We repeatedly tried and tested the method is as follows. Respondents were asked to write ten personally significant social values in their own words. The second part of the task was to explain the meaning of each item. In addition, it was proposed to quantitatively assess each of the written values on a scale with a maximum of 100 points. This technique, in contrast to the method of direct ranking by M. Rokeach, aims to identify the subjective value preferences of respondents, not to measure the attitudes to the values on the same list for all categories of respondents. The study by this method shows significant differences in the value sets, even in a homogeneous group of respondents. This method gives a survey of "nominal" judgment: only short, or a little more detailed names of different categories (in our case - personal values). Such responses have a lot of repetitions in the majority of respondents, and are generally easily divided into classes, which enables statistical processing of the responses and, at the same time, studying the specifics of different groups' ideas. Thus, this method has advantages in both qualitative and quantitative strategies.

AB The author analyses the preamble from the recently published kudurru of the Kassite king of Babylonia Kadasman-Harbe I (ca. 1400 BC). He comes to the conclusion that this king positioned himself as the one who delivered Babylonia from the state in which it had come after the fall of Hammurabi's dynasty and considered his victory over the Suteans as a historical revenge for the calamities the country had gone through during the period of this fall. The texts of the kudurru allows to think that in the late Old Babylonian period Hana on the Middle Euphrates and the dominions of the Kassite House of Gandas were two contiguous, but different territorial and political units and that at a certain moment under Samsuditana (and before the Hittites appeared at the Babylonian horizon), Hana seceded from Babylonia and began a war against it.

AB The article covers the role the Great Britain has played as a fourth independent political actor of international relations, along with the U.S., EU and NATO, in the political crisis in Ukraine from its very beginning (2014), and in finding quick and effective ways of solving it. The article also explores the worsening of the bilateral relationship between UK and Russia under the influence of the 2014-2015 Ukrainian crisis, in a wide context of antagonism between the U.S. and Russia. There are several factors introduced in the article which hampered the crisis from the start and which still can be used to improve the bilateral relations in the nearest future. The author scrutinizes the evolution of the Britain's stance on the Ukrainian upheaval at the beginning of 2014, the Crimea annexation/joining perceived as a violation of the international law, Russia's interference in the conflict in the Eastern territories of Ukraine, and the imposing of sever EU and U.S. sanctions against Russia. The article highlights the influence of the Ukrainian crisis on the strengthening of Anglo-American "special relations" and on the revival of the NATO strategic role as a tool to confront Russia not only in this conflict, but also on the world stage. The author tries to assess the scope of damage for the UK-Russia relationship made by the Ukrainian crisis and answer the questions: where has British participation in this crisis boosted the Great Britain's world standing, when can the UK-Russia relations become better again, and what can help improve the relationship between two countries?

AB The construction and exploitation of the Chinese Eastern Railway (ChER) is an important event in the history of Russian and Chinese relations. As a result, unique phenomenon of Russian culture appeared there in the foreign land. Russian emigration managed to keep national traditions in spite of extreme conditions of living abroad. At that time the role of books in their spiritual world was great.
   A lot of marks on the books from the Harbin libraries are a striking illustration of extensive spreading and using Russian literature in Manchuria. Stamps, seals, library labels of numerous holders help to observe the whole Russian book spreading process in China - from the activities of printing and publishing houses, libraries to book-selling organizations. The Transbaikal regional library named after A.S. Pushkin is a holder of a large Harbin collection. The first attempts have been made to find the information about its real holders for the catalog "ChER history in Bookmarks".
   It appeared that book spreading in Manchuria began from the first reading-hall in old Harbin in 1897 as reminded the stamp "Public Library of Sungari Shops".
   In pre-revolutionary period Russian emigration organized about 15 public and special libraries in Harbin. The largest of them were considered to be the Railway Assembly and ChER Central libraries. Some stamps keep the memory about the first school, opened in 1898 in Old Harbin for Russian and Chinese children. Library label of the bookbinder's shop of an orphan asylum in Modyagou proves the fact that in Harbin there wasn't such a disgraceful phenomenon as child homelessness.
   In 1899 four new printing engines started Russian publications in New Harbin. Later on some printing and publishing houses formed their own editorial policy. There were issued a large number of serious works on history, economics, ethnography, agriculture and other disciplines, concerning Manchuria. The most part of scientific works of the Orientalist's Society and the Society of the Manchuria Region Study were printed in the largest printing house owned by ChER.
   A wide choice of literary production could be found in numerous bookstores. Usually their addresses were shown in the seals. I.T. Shchelokov was known as a monopolist in Harbin bookselling. The variety of book depended greatly on political views of the holder. In contrast to monarchist Shchelokov P.V. Rovensky was a socialist-revolutionary and used his bookstore for popularization ideas of his party. Some publishing house had own bookstores, binder's shops and libraries and offered various services to spread their publications.
   Special stamp marked books from the library of a town government institution, formed in 1908. It organized public services and amenities in Harbin.
   These simple book marks retrace the evolution of Russian book culture centers in the territory of China. There is a certain urgency to collect and keep these unique documents of the amazing culture land "Russian Harbin".

AB The influence of new media on political relations, processes and institutions are growing in the contemporary society. A proof of it could be a number of empirical cases of participation of these media in political events of recent years. Political identification in contemporary society is also under the influence of these media. They are giving users an access to tremendous volume of information about political attitudes, views, events and processes. Moreover activity of different political forces could be seen in these media. The article shows the lack of clarity in the issue of how an access to political information influences on the speed of political identification. New media are able to strengthen links inside existing political identities. The article states that new media is an environment where new leaders could appear. Emergence of such leaders could be caused by activity in frameworks of the project in new media. In order to unite significant numbers of users of these media such a leader needs to set an agenda. In that case identity will be problem-subject character. The article state also that users of new media play an important role in in processes dealing with political identification. Sometimes it is done unconsciously by sharing information or opinion about some political event.

TI The Benin Kingdom (13th - 19th Centuries) as a Megacommunity
SO SOCIAL EVOLUTION & HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB The article provides an anthropological analysis of the sociopolitical system of the Benin Kingdom from coming to power of the Oba dynasty till the British conquest. The course of this system formation and its basic characteristic features are outlined. It is argued that the Benin Kingdom between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries was a supercomplex society but not a state, as it was not based on suprakin (territorial) social ties and there was no professional (bureaucratic) administration in it. The kin-based extended family community always remained this society's focus, and the supracommunal institutions were built up by its matrix, what is impossible in a state. So, being not less complex and developed than many so-called 'early states' (e.g., Claessen and Skalnik 1978) or 'archaic states' (Feinman and Marcus 1998), Benin was not a state but rather a specific alternative to the state. This form of socio-political organization can be called 'a megacommunity' and depicted as four concentric circles forming an upset cone: the extended family, the community, the chiefdom, and finally the kingdom.

AB The article describes the debate on foreign policy of the post-Soviet Russia, which took place at the Academic Council of IMEMO in 1992-1994. What are the national interests of the Russian young democracy? What should be Russian foreign policy in the new geopolitical situation, after the collapse of the USSR? To what extent the transformation of socio-political system in Russia changed the nature of its foreign policy? What should be its principles and priorities after the end of the Cold War? All these and other questions were in the focus of IMEMO experts immediately after the collapse of the communist regime in 1991. From the outset, the discussions were marked by different approaches to the issues. Some experts put forward as a priority the relations with the U.S. and the West in general, some put Europe in the first place, and others - the Commonwealth of Independent States, which brought together some of the former Soviet republics. But all IMEMO experts in general agreed on the negative evaluation of the new Russian foreign policy quality: the default of a senior management for clear understanding of strategic and tactical foreign policy goals, low professional level of those who were called to form and implement foreign policy, the absence of a single center for decision-making, the lack of coordination between various authorities involved in the development of a foreign policy strategy - Presidential Administration, Security Council, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Defense, Parliament, etc. As mentioned in the discussions, the initial stage of idealistic notions and expectations of the West prevalent in Russian society and in the new ruling elite circles after the fall of the Soviet regime was soon replaced by disappointment and even irritation towards the West. Both of these trends were equally dangerous to the interests of the Russian foreign policy, which was in great need of a pragmatic, professional understanding of realities. This policy had to achieve two main objectives - full integration of Russia into the world community of developed democracies, and protection of its own national interests within this community. One should have been inextricably linked with the other. Academic understanding of national interests in the field of foreign, defense and economic policies, the development of specific proposals and recommendations on these issues for the state leadership has become one of priorities for IMEMO analysts.

AB In 2014, as part of International scientific and practical conference "Library in the field of cross-cultural communications", the regional center of the literary monuments of a Transbaikal Regional Universal Scientific Library named after Pushkin made a series of studies on intercultural communication in the librarian and informational sector. In particular, extensive material relating to the date of the 110th anniversary of the completion of construction work on the CER (Chinese Eastern Railway) is identified and examined. Introduction to the theme has long been in a non-priority, was the reason to the creation of the book collection, preserved traces of it stay on the territory of neighboring China. Separately were studied bookplates, stamp seal impressions, library labels, autographs, marginalia. Progressively the way a book came in a foreign land (which initially was not perceived such) is shaped. Changes in the political life of Russia through the books are clearly traced. Censorship indulgence caused by the events of 1905-1907., is influenced the work of publishers, including Harbin: readers acquainted with the Marxist literature, the works of Lenin and of the revolutionary movement in Russia. At the same time, readers enjoyed the famous "pavlenkovskaya 'series' Lives of Outstanding People'. Do not go unnoticed memorable 1812 and the 300th anniversary of the House of Romanov. Among other publishers are distinguished I.D. Sytin.
   Since the beginning of WWI, much has changed in the editorial policy of Russia and the Russian diasporas. The October Revolution of 1917 completed the situation: from Russia to Harbin gushing wave of immigrants; formed "white" movement with its literature. Books about the Events of the Civil War even further pushed Harbin from home, although the literature of the first years of Soviet power continued to arrive in shops and libraries. Published in a simple yellow-gray paper, books told about the successes in socialist construction.
   Over time, the flow of printed products from Russia began to decline, but in Harbin has successfully developed its own printing. There, in the late 20's and early 30-ies., by concentrating research effort and the emergence of various companies, it was issued a large number of serious works on history, economics, ethnography, agriculture, meteorology and other disciplines. Harbin became the center of oriental studies, aided by active work of the Orientalists Society and the Society of study of the Manchurian region. Most of these publications printed in the largest printing plant owned by CER.
   With the gradual disappearance of Russian settlements in Manchuria was gone and the Russian libraries, this amazing culture island, to create a special spiritual world in a foreign country that has become home to many of our compatriots. Searching of survive book treasures, almost half a century, which combined Russian and Chinese culture, continues, and perhaps lead to new discoveries.

DE women's socio-political movement; the political rights; gender equality
AB In the article "features of modern political movement of women" discusses General approaches to the study of political activity, reveals the specific features of the women's movement in Russia, among which the most important seem to be:
   - lack of awareness of their civil rights activists, their low level of knowledge and legal awareness, lack of ability to protect their rights;
   - underestimating the need for political participation;
   - insufficient development of the relationship of feminist theory and practice of the women's movement;
   - narrow social base, fragmentation and "elitism" of the movement;
   - the absence of strong female leaders;
   - the incorporation of independent NGOs to government agencies;
   - lack of material resources to support infrastructure, social movements, and especially the women's movement;
   - the absence of a national women's ideas, able to lead the women's movement in the direction of consolidation;
   - distrust of attempts to organizational coordination "from top to bottom" in which are infringing on the autonomy;
   - the lack of real work on building coalitions within women's NGOs and other social and political forces, including parties, trade unions, etc.
   The women's movement is very diverse and in social structures and ideological orientation, however, argues in the public consciousness and in the consciousness of the women themselves world-view that divides the view of woman as the subject of history, which gives women the right to own choice role in society.
   The requirement of equal opportunities, which certainly is more than a simple equality - gender requirement implies the protection of the rights and interests of both women and men taking into account the specificity of each subject's socio-sex groups.
   Russian society as a whole needs to understand that only gender harmony is the way to a civilized and comfortable society and the state, which comfortably worthy female and male individuals citizens of the country.
   It is no exaggeration to say that it is active, enterprising and persevering women's movement, constantly working on improvement of their professional and political level, can become a key factor in the implementation of all positive changes in the status of the female population in achieving the goal of gender equality. Achieving gender balance requires political will, legislative, effective economic and social policies.

AB This article deals with the impact of various factors on the perception of Russia in different European countries. The focus is on the role of mass media, expert and political elites in forming of Russia's image, especially in the context of Ukrainian crisis. In this article, the reaction of different European counties to events in Ukraine, the polarization of European space is analyzed: some countries prefer to put a pressure on the Russian Federation, other - to find a way out of the critical situation and reach a compromise. Some political establishment representatives in France, Germany, Czech Republic support Russia and the reunification with Crimea, dispute sanctions against Russia. For such politicians, this support results from anti-American views and independent foreign policy aspirations. Other representatives of the European elite demand tougher approach and more pressure on Russia by any means whatsoever (including military ones). European business-communities reveal great interest in solving issues related to sanctions. Many entrepreneurs in Europe (in particular major corporations in France, UK, Germany, Italy), who profit from long and fruitful cooperation with Russia, are against anti-Russian sanctions. In view of the Ukrainian crisis, Russia has to face and solve various important issues. How can Russia implement a modernization project after burning all traditional bridges to the West and western friends and partners? What is the right way for Russian foreign policy to support and defend Russian-speaking people all over the world? Which European political forces can provide support to Russia? How can civil society affect and influence cooperation between Russia and Europe?

DE historical politology; construct; illegitimate violence; history of
   power; ancient Russia
AB Legitimate violence is one of the most important characteristics of the governmental authority. According to the generally recognized concept of M. Verber only the government has a right (recognized by the population) to use the violence in order to protect the interests of a person, communities or the whole population. This concept concerns an established government. In the communities where the governmental structures are in the process of forming (like ancient Russia in X-XII centuries) the situation is more complicated. The government does not appear with no base. It substitutes the structures of a tribal society. During the substitution period, in the collective consciousness of the population exist two contradicting authority models and two models of violence respectively: a tribal model and a governmental one. In ancient Russia this models were "veche violence" and "knyaz violence". Both of them had been recognized as natural (legitimate) until the knyaz violence model became the only one considered as a right one and reflecting the type of new formed nation state.
   Several types of Non legitimate violence existed in ancient Russia. First type (by the time of appearance) was the violence between a knyaz and a local society (collisions: Igor-Drevlians, Jaroslav-Novgorodians). Second type: violence between knyazes (blinding of Vasiliko Trebovalsky). Third type: violence of governing elite members towards the knyaz (Andrey Bogolyubsky murder).
   The first type of non-legitimate violence was liquidated while the sphere of legitimacy of grand knyaz was spreading. The forms of cooperation between government and population regulated by the law were protected from non-legitimate violence by both parties.
   The second violence type (between knyazes) was not (and couldn't be) regulated by law. Therefore the violence between knyazes was practiced on a regular basis in the XII-XV centuries. During XIII-XIV centuries there were no conditions for initiation of 3rd type of violence due to the change of the of knyazes' government functioning terms. That time knyazes were under the political influence of Orda and struggling for legitimacy they had to rely on the elite stopping the conflicts with it.

AB This article is characterized features of the modern geopolitical situation in Southern Russia as the union of the three federal districts in the country, based on the dynamics of political events in recent years. Among the main features of the geopolitical situation of the South of Russia the author identifies a large number of neighboring countries, frontier subjects, the proximity to breakaway state formations, seaside location, the impact on the Region of activity of international political, economic and military alliances and organizations as geopolitical actors.
   South of Russia appears to us as a set of three federal districts - South, North Caucasus and Crimea (formed in March 2014 after joining the Crimea Sevastopol to Russia). The area of the South of Russia - 618.4 thousand km(2) (3.6% of the territory of Russia), the population - 26 million persons (18% of the population of Russia). Leading position in the area of the territory and population as part of the South of Russia takes the Southern Federal District. Crimean district is the smallest in the south of Russia and in the whole country.
   The main features of the geopolitical position of the South of Russia are as follows:
   1. Localization territory of subjects the South of Russia along the border of the country. Of the 15 subjects of the South of Russia 12 subjects are located at the landlubber state border of Russia.
   2. Along the borders of the South of Russia are located the breakaway state entities such as Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics.
   3. South of Russia has a wide output in the Black Sea, Azov Sea and the Caspian Sea. The legal status of these water bodies are not fully resolved and require further negotiations
   4. A significant impact on the region has interstate economic, political and military alliances and organizations. Leading positions here remain the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Eurasian Economic Union, contributing to the strengthening of integration relations in the former Soviet territory. The worrying implications has accession of Ukraine and Georgia in association with the European Union, as well as the activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization near the boundaries of the South of Russia
   5. In the South of Russia is spread impact vectors of geopolitical development of many countries, which include this territory in the zones of its influence. The most actively pursue its policy in the region, Turkey and the United States, as geopolitical rivals Russia.
   6. Was expanded area of maritime boundaries in the South of Russia at the expense of joining the Crimea. However, no direct communication by land between the Crimea and mainland of Russia is problematic factor geopolitical situation in South of Russia.
   In summary, it can be noted that the specificity of the geopolitical position of the South of Russia are the complexity of the localization structure, diversity and contradictions of factors influencing it, the dynamic changes. The territory of the region is in the zone of attention many states and international organizations, which in the future will facilitate actively to their impact on the development of the situation in the regions of the South of Russia. At the same time the presence of a large number of neighboring countries, placement along the border, strong territorial contingence of the South Russian subjects with neighboring countries, including the breakaway territories, wide access to the seas will contribute to strengthening of the transit potential of the geopolitical situation in the region in the implementation of foreign policy and economic relations with other regions.

The author points to a number of factors that influenced the process of formation of the political system of China. We give a description of the Chinese political system since the beginning of its formation. The author also points to the need of restructuring and modernization of the socio-economic system of China. According to Sushchenko M. A. economic modernization in China, carried out by the Chinese political elite from the late 1970s, was the cause of political system transformation. The author believes that the current stage of political modernization in China began with the approval of the Chinese ruling elite of the "fourth generation" of PRC leaders. Since the beginning of the 2000s the main features and characteristics of the process formed in China. It offers an original formulation of political modernization in China. The article highlighted features of the model of Chinese political modernization, which plays a great role in Confucian traditions, the evolutionary nature of political transformation is marked as well as paramount importance for the political transformation of economic reforms is considered. It specifies the role of the ideological factor and continuity in the process of modernization.
   Among the factors of political modernization social, cultural and personal, ones are mentioned: integration of China into the global processes of globalization, the development of the Internet and modern means of communication. The article also indicates the direction of political modernization. As one of the main directions of political modernization we highlight the institutionalization of the mechanism of change of power in China. Among other areas of political modernization Sushchenko M.A. sees improving inner-party democracy, administrative reform, reform of the judicial system, the improvement of the electoral system, the development of local election laws and governments. The author also points the attention to the democratic vector of the country development. As directions of the transformation of the political system changes the author sees in legislation and the work of public authorities, public and political organizations, the action of citizens in civil society subsystems. Among the main mechanisms of political modernization Sushchenko M.A. considers national and social policy of China. According to author a new stage of political modernization in China will begin by the end of the 2nd term in office of the "Fifth Generation" of Chinese leaders and will depend on the economic, social and cultural transformations in the People's Republic of China.

AB The analysis of national political practice on the question of a party dominance formation allows correlation of the formal party position of the "United Russia" with its real significance in political system. It also allows making reasonable conclusions about the impact of this political party on the processes of political decision making. As an example such a key question as a formation of a responsible party government that won the elections to the national parliament is analyzed. Despite the fact that the pro-government ideologists and technologists compare the "United Russia" with different dominant parties in other political systems (forming national governments), nevertheless Russian regulatory practice doesn't give the winning party a competence to form a responsible government. This paper investigates the reasons and conditions that impede the dominant parliamentary party becoming a "ruling party." Special attention is paid to the role of ideology in ensuring the party dominance in Russia, during which a conclusion that such an over-arching political party as the "United Russia" doesn't need a full-fledged ideology is made. The ideology is replaced by a tactical substitute - "the ideology of everyday life." The result is represented as a conclusion why this political party won't be granted the right to form the highest executive body of the state power in the Russian Federation.

DE parliamentary control; parliamentary inquiry; audit chambers
AB Many scholars have noted the growth of dependence of Russian legislatures on executive authorities. For this reason it seems important to scrutinize the effectiveness of realization of parliament's functions in contemporary Russia. The number of functions varies from author to author, but all of them emphasize the heightened control.
   Parliamentary control is implemented by the higher legislative (representative) body. We define it as a complex of measures which includes the monitoring and audit of the public administration and, also, the recommendations on the elimination of violations and the causes and conditions that contributed to their occurrence.
   This article is devoted to the development and practices of parliamentary commissions of inquiry and account chambers. By analyzing the process of the institutionalization of investigation commissions, we highlight the main shortcomings of the regulation of parliamentary investigation. For example, a restrictive list of objects under parliament control, the failure of the mechanism which should be used for considering the results of finished investigations, or the lack of transparency in activities of parliamentary commissions of inquiry. We argue for the need of careful analysis of different approaches to organizing and providing parliament investigations in Russian regions, and also question of how the results of parliamentary investigations influence the political agenda.
   We look at the control over the account chamber for the process of implementation of budgetary obligations. Analysis of activity of control-account chambers demonstrates that recommendations of these bodies are usually used during budgeting. The consequences of such participation include budget optimization, the exclusion of illegal outcomes, etc. We outline a few systematic problems, like increasing the budget without special circumstances, lack of legal framework, considerable year-end funding, unreliability of financial statements, lack of control over the execution of works from the side of state customers, and diversion of public funds.
   Finally we indicate the need to research the role of parliamentary commissions of inquiry in the political process and approaches to assessing the efficiency of account chamber.

AB The paper considers sociological appliance of one of the visual methods - photo-elicitation interview. The method implies interviews that use photographs as motivation for informants' responses and reflection. Despite the interest in visual culture in the contemporary social sciences the method is hardly ever used in the analysis of its production. There are works with photo-elicitation interviews that include the analysis of visual dimensions of the researched phenomena as well as photographic conventions. However the photo-elicitation interviews have not been used in order to get the narratives of the professional producers of the visual.
   The author presents her own experience of using of the method in the research of production of news images and shows its advantages and difficulties. The research was focused on the production process in the practice of employee of the photo department of major wire services. The ethnographic observation of the work of the photo departments showed that the photography should not be considered as something that appears at the end of the "production chain'. Rather it should be noted that photography is present in all everyday practices of photojournalists. The traditional interviews allowed grasping the principles that guide the news images production in wire services. However, the informants had difficulties in giving examples and demonstrating how those principles are applied or missed in their professional practices. Thus, the photo-elicitation method was used so that the informant could have their own news photographs to rely on while sharing their experience. Moreover, the questions concerning concrete visual decisions were easier to ask having actual examples before the eyes. The photo-elicitation interviews made possible to study the practices of deviance from the visual format of wire services, to get the narratives on professional practices beyond self-representations of professionals, to contextualize the decision-making process concerning visual and to see the backstage of profession. The method proved to be fruitful for studies of professional production of the visual as well as for the studies of professional practices and the principles of visualization.

AB The article analyzes IMEMO activities in 1992-1993, when in Russia, under the influence of both radical economic reforms and drastic weakening of the central government, a deep political crisis emerged and gained a dangerous traction, fraught with the death of a young democracy and even the collapse of the state. Under these conditions, along with economic issues, the politological research came to the fore in IMEMO - the analysis of the country's new political system, the definition of its development vector. The Center of Socio-economic and Socio-political Research of IMEMO headed by German Germanovich Diligenskii played the major role in this work. Analysts of the Center prepared a number of recommendations for public authorities concerning the creation and development of a new democratic political system in Russia. IMEMO experts paid the utmost attention to the nature of the political crisis that arose in the post-Soviet Russia in late 1991, and the ways to overcome it. In January 1993, the results of the study were presented to the discussion at the Academic Council. It was agreed that one of the main causes of the political crisis in the country was the social tensions worsening, as a consequence of the "shocking therapy" conducted by the government of Gaidar in 1992. In the discussion on the political outlook German Diligenskii, rejecting the possibility of the old command-administrative system restoration, substantiated a probability of transformation of the "market democracy" not yet established in Russia into the "authoritarian monopoly or monopoly-bureaucratic system". Noting the disunity of democratic forces, weakness of the entrepreneurial class, largely dependent on the state, Diligenskii formulated a program for uniting all adherents of "market democracy" under the slogan of "social liberalism", which would take into account Russian specifics. Consolidation of democracy and market economy in Russia is impossible without preservation of the state territorial integrity and consolidation of the central government, with a clear division of functions and powers of its constituent branches. Monopolization (usurpation) of all power by one of the branches -legislative or executive should not be allowed. The victory of any of them in any case would mean the defeat of democracy. Such was, in general terms, the position of IMEMO in the face of the 1992-1993 political crisis.

DT Article
DE India; untouchables; caste; politics in India; political parties of
   India; the Dalits; political mobilization; electoral processes
AB The article is devoted to the political performance of the Dalits - the former untouchables - on the political scene of modern India. Though the Dalits constitute a fourth of all population, until today they haven't achieved great influence in Indian policy. There are only few Dalit party-players at the national level. A great success of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh several years ago is vanishing, and the Party's bad results in the last elections (national and regional) prove this negative tendency. In recent years, BSP faced internal divisions between its leader and party members as well as the lack of clear and constant strategy. The Party attempted to focus on broad layers of population from the Dalits to high castes, but started to lose the support of its core voters, i.e. the Dalits. The "Mody wave" during the last general elections in 2014 was able to catch Dalit voters practically in all states. Survey findings argue that the winner Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the new charismatic prime-minister Narendra Modi challenged the Indian National Congress (INK), a traditional supporter of the Dalits, in most of issues. Dalit parties could hardly compose a strong alliance with other low castes parties, but their local leaders easily joined the current winner BJP. The Dalits face problems of their political identity, the lack of integration, and still act as "bank voters ", as usual.

DE tribe; chiefdom; political and social anthropology
AB The term tribe is the most controversial concept in modern anthropology, ethnology, sociology and history. Many modern researchers believe that this concept is generated by the colonial era and is a "colonial myth" or a "historiographical phantom", and on this basis it has to be rejected in the modern research practice. This article shows how the notion of tribe (and the attitudes to it) had been configured and was changing over time. It is stated that the term and the concept behind it the tribe has not lost its relevance, heuristic, and its use is extremely important for anthropologists to maintain their own professional self-identity. The concept of tribe is complementary to the key concept of political anthropology - chiefdom.

DT Article
DE early elections in Israel; law proposal on the Jewish character of the
   State of Israel; judicial activism; the Supreme Court of Israel; the
   Zionist union; B. Netanyahu's speech before the American Congress
AB Israel is a kind of a test field in the modern world. Developing of a young and very dynamic society is going on here in the highly hostile environment, under pressure of permanent terrorist and war threats. Contradictions abound in Israel. The answer is still to be found, whether the Jewish character of the state ensuring a privileged position to the Jews is compatible with principles of liberal democracy proclaimed as its basic values. There are ongoing discussions on the role of religion and its much more prominent position in Israel than in other Western democracies. The process of the national identity building is under way, and a controversial law proposal on the Jewish character of the state can cause a governmental crisis, lead to dissolution of the Knesset and to early elections. The elections of 2015 were not a follow-up of a political situation in the country. Prime-minister B. Netanyahu used his constitutional right to dissolve the government and the parliament as an instrument to enlist people's support for a new term of service and for a more obedient government coalition building. But the electoral campaign turned against him. He was accused of corruption, breach of confidence, and in his turn, did not hesitate to resort to electoral technologies in the fight against his opponents. As a result, the electoral campaign 2015 has lost much of its meaning as a chance to discuss the ways of solving many problems both in socio-economic field and in foreign policy. At the last moment, B. Netanyahu mobilized his voters by intimidating them with the accession of the left government and won the election battle.

DT Article
DE Arctic; USA; Russian Federation; Arctic policy; sovereignty;
   territoriality; extraterritoriality; UNO International Convention on the
   Law of the Seas
AB The article deals with the situation of competition for resources (primarily oil and gas) between states, in the Arctic Region. The reasoning is generally based on the assumption that today's competitive process is mainly shaped and determined by the specificity of the international political system. At present, the founding principle of international environment is the assumption of the state territorial sovereignty that reduces the possibilities of action towards resources, mainly to remote supplies via international trade and territorialisation, i.e. embracing the parcel of interest by the state border and its inclusion into the space guarded by state sovereign authority. In turn, this leads to a crucial increase of the expansion on the sea importance, since the land territory is already delimited among the sovereign polities. For Russian Federation this means that the Arctic Region will acquire the greatest importance in the state territorial strategy. The author further analyses the strategies of Russia's competitors from Arctic Region and beyond, and finds out that the U.S. strategy is of the principle importance, even though the Arctic does not present a first rank priority for this state. Nevertheless, the politics of the USA is an example of a novel approach to the outer territories that goes beyond the traditional view on international system. This approach is unilateral and is based on a novel reading of the sovereignty concept. The indicating point is not signing the International Convention on the Law of the Seas that enables the USA to act with lesser need for coordination with other participants of the international system. The instrumental support for this policy is the increasing usage of extraterritorial application of national laws and particular norms. The article provides case analyses of such policies towards resources, companies, international organizations and can be used in the Arctic that presents an ideal place for extraterritorially shaped policy to implement. The article also posits that in Russia the lack of interest toward extraterritoriality of laws is evident, while this could become an effective instrument of the state interest promoting.

DT Editorial Material
DE tribe; ethnicity; potestarity; primitive society; chiefdom; ethnology;
   political anthropology
AB The paper is devoted to the different interpretations of the term "tribe". The author concludes that modern science does not give a clear answer to the question, what is a "tribe". In modern literature dominates ethnic and social constructivism, extrapolating the past speculative model of the Marxist theory of primitive society. In encyclopaedic and educational literature a "tribe" is declared as primitive ethno-potestarian (ethnosocial) institute combining ethnic community and potestarian organization. The Soviet social tribes are considered as the primary form of ethnic community (as part of the well-known triad "tribe - nation - a nation"). In foreign historiography tribe is defined as the segmental "nadobschinnoy" political structure. Each segment in it (community, lineage) is economically independent, and leadership is personal and does not involve any formal positions. In evolutionary schemes tribe is usually placed between the primitive community and the chiefdom. The author concludes that the concept of "tribe" is characterized by the loss of the uniqueness of the terminology and the conversion to a phantom. At the same time the modern Russian ethnologist are refused to use of the concept a "tribe" and a term "ethnos" and his derivatives are used, and also "people", not having stadial attachment and not defiant associations with the primitivity. In political anthropology a "tribe" is replaced by "chiefdom" and its analogues. In other words, the concept of "tribe" has lost its former conceptuality. In political anthropology "tribe" ("Potestarian tribe") is replaced by "chiefdom" and its analogues.

AB In the system of modern international relations the Muslim world plays an increasingly prominent role due to several factors of economic, political, social and religious nature. The Middle East is a region that has always aroused the keen interest and attention of the great powers - in this large, populous and resource-rich territory there are many "pain points" related to global problems of mankind. The Middle East accounts for about 2/3 of reliable oil supplies. Oil-producing Arab monarchies have always been an arena of intense competition, not only between oil interests, but also between different States in their struggle for political influence, economic benefits, and strategic base. Russia has always had different from the rest of Europe view on this region, but one thing was certain - the USSR and the new Russia were distinguished with great interest and concern for the situation in the Middle East. The article is devoted to the analysis of the Middle East policy of Russia and the USA; it analyzes the position and role of Russia and the U.S. in the context of recent events in the Arab world; it examines the efforts of the two countries aimed at normalizing interelations. The author evaluates the problems and prospects for further cooperation between Russia and countries of the Arab East in the economic and political spheres.

DE labour relations in Russia; privatization; social partnership; working
   class; power-property matrix
AB The article is aimed at revealing the origins of the core contradictions in social and labour relations in Russia since the collapse of the USSR. The transition to market economy of Russian society since the early 1990s has not brought a fully fledged concept of labour relations. The concept of labour relations found in Russia today is rather the product of the ignorance of the state authorities, which led to a situation of increased tension between labour and capital. The contradictions in social and labour-relations stem, on the one hand, from Soviet society, and on the other, have been generated by the transition to market per se. The author endeavours to give response to the question, why does a model of social partnership limit itself only to its formal aspects rather than seek an essential shift in the direction of the establishment workable framework of labour relations?

AB Upon becoming president of the United States, Barack Obama formulated the policy of reset in the U.S.-Russia relations - as part of his grand project of improving international relations on a more equitable basis, with a bigger role for diplomacy and international alliances and less reliance on unilateral actions and the use of force. As part of resetting their relationship in the military-political field, the United States and Russia were able, in the first and part of the second tenure of Obama's presidency, to claim some major achievements in the military-political field, such as signing the New START Treaty, working on further nuclear disarmament measures, and developing bilateral anti-terrorist activities. U.S. Russia cooperation also resulted in Russia's agreement to open up its air space and railways for NATO transports which helped the International Coalition to conduct operation in Afghanistan in its "surge" phase and then to successfully withdraw combat units from that country. U.S.-Russia relations were also instrumental in bridging the positions of the two countries with regard to Iran's and North Korea's nuclear problem, with Russia and China voting alongside with the United States on UN Security Council resolutions for sanctions against North Korea and Iran to make them comply with the nuclear safeguards. Yet in various regions of the world, Obama's policy - initially announced as an innovative breakthrough strategy proved instead to be reactive, aimed not at future perspective, but at dealing with the emerging crises on a case by case basis: in Lybia, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and then finally in Ukraine. The "pivot" to the Asia-Pacific, also announced by Obama's administration, was formulated without consideration of Russia's interests in the region, while at the same time causing turbulence in relations with China, and was finally overshadowed by the Ukrainian crisis and then the ISIS offensive in the Middle East. The reset fell prey to the contradictions in U.S.-Russia relations which particularly exacerbated after the events in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine and led to freezing of arms control negotiations and bilateral U.S.-Russia cooperation in the military-political field. The Ukrainian crisis is likely to have long-term negative consequences, and in particular will increase hawkish tendencies in U.S. politics. Yet this does not preclude and to the contrary increases the importance of seeking ways to strengthen stability, searching for possible measures for nuclear weapons limitations which would become applicable after bilateral relations improve. U.S.-Russia cooperation remains essential for resolving key international challenges as well as major regional problems.

DE formal logic; Kant; Whately; Bolzano; thought; language; object
AB The development of formal logic in 19th century Europe is considered in the paper. The principal idea is that that during this logic developed as three independent traditions: German, British and Austrian. The German tradition was definitely influenced by I. Kant. The (general pure) logic was considered here as a science of the form of thought, in abstraction from any object (content). J.F. Fries and J.F. Herbart proposed the most influential conceptions of the philosophy of logic. The former developed the anthropological (psychological) foundation for logic. The latter shifted the subject of logic from "thinking" to "thinkable". His presuppositions were disclosed in details in the remarkable "Neue Darstellung der Logic" of his pupil M.W. Drobisch. A. Trendelenburg exposed the final commonly accepted view of the subject; he also coined the very term "formal logic". The principles of the British traditions were laid down by R. Whately, and in fact that principles formed the paradigm of British tradition in the philosophy of logic. The logic was considered here as an inquiry of reasoning, and its formal character was explained by the fact that it deals with the form of language expression. Approaches of Whately were severely attacked by W. Hamilton, but his arguments, in spite of soundness, appeared to be ineffective. The development of this tradition is traced up to J.S. Mill and A. de Morgan. Mill has created the groundwork for future development of logical semantics by his theory of denotation and connotation. De Morgan has expanded the linguistic approach to logic on its algebraic handling. Both of them extended, in different ways, the conception of reasoning. B.Bolzano was the father-founder of the Austrian tradition. Logic was typically viewed here as a general theory of science (Wissensschaftslehre). Logic is formal because it deals with the form of objects and relations in general. The principal feature of the Austrian logical tradition consists in the fact that it included some kind the theory of object. It is pointed and demonstrated in the paper that the factual 'inventor' of the logical theory of object was R. Zimmerman, the student of Bolzano. The formation of the Austrian logical style was completed due to the school of Brentano. The specific features of the school are discussed on the instance of the A. Hofler's "Logik". The concluding part of the paper contains very short outline of the remarkable similarities between the ideas of Frege and principles, shared or discussed by the school of Brentano.

AB The new place of knowledge in modern society initiated its definition as "knowledge society". Modern knowledge acquired social-cultural significance. It has entered into every social structure and has resulted in all social spheres. Knowledge recognized as a key resource for the development of society. This has led to the emergence of new professionals to the society. Knowledge is their main "productive" capital. In abroad literature researchers use the term "knowledge worker" to name new workers. Knowledge workers are presented as professionals, whose work is focused on the manipulation of knowledge (receiving, using, distribution, development). Their work has intellectual character. It is defined by the term "knowledge work" in the literature. The creation of new knowledge is the main element of modern workers. They are in constant communication interaction with other people for this. Transfer and development of new knowledge is a result of communication. New workers use knowledge for professional activity. It is a key feature of the concept "knowledge work". Thus, the mind (sense) of the individual is the most important "factor of production" in modern society. We need to consider the person as intellectual capital, because knowledge is becoming the main capital of modern society. Intellectual capital is inseparable from person. It allows us to speak about the increasing value of knowledge workers for organizations of which they are, and for the whole society. Creating of new knowledge is the part of the process of solving professional problems which modern workers face. In addition, knowledge, which is created by their activity, supports a continuous process of development of knowledge in whole. In turn it leads to the development of society. Consideration of knowledge workers is an essential part of the study of the problem of the knowledge society. This type of personality appears as socio-cultural response to the challenges of the world of professional knowledge society.

TI A FACTORIAL APPROACH IN BRANCH LEGAL SCIENCES

DT Article
DE factorial approach; essence of law; system of law; law making;
   determining factors; effectiveness of law making
AB One of the actual issues both in the theory of law and in branch legal sciences is the analysis of the reasons and conditions determining the development and functioning of the system of law. Applying a factorial approach to the evaluation of legal phenomena, we can reveal the essence of law; increase the effectiveness of both law-making activities and realization of legal rules. A factorial approach is being widely analyzed in philosophical works and the works on common theory of law. However, we come across the ideas of determinism in branch legal sciences more often since the research into the system of the branch of law on the basis of these methodological grounds promotes the cognition of its inner content, its structural elements, their interrelationship and interdependence, inner contradictions and, consequently, creates the conditions for the effective modernization of a separate branch of law.
   We cannot but notice a principally different approach to the determination of purposes for the application of a factorial theory in branch sciences. A. A. Ter-Akopov thought that "it's no use speaking about sociology, criminal law and criminal policy beyond the category of determinism". It was O.V. Grevtsov who realized a factorial approach in legal science among the first and separated both objective and subjective factors of the formation of criminal policy (the factors of criminality). According to him: "the factors determining criminality and criminal policy represent a dialectical unity of objective conditions and subjective prerequisites for the social development and include political, legal and other public relations, natural conditions and legal culture".
   Civil law pays little attention to the theory of factors; no research connected with the methodological role of the principle of determinism has been carried out yet. This results in an ambiguous evaluation of its significance and purposes for its application. Civil law is supposed to separate both external and internal determinants. Economics can be referred to the former ones but V.V.Vasiliev believes the collaboration of economics and law "to be a dependent derivative from the factor of a personality as an important external factor of determination in civil law".
   Thus, modern legal science does not know any unified concept enabling us to apply a factorial approach as a methodological basis for legal research.

DE scientific practice; subjective basis of scientific practice; scientific
   habitus; dispositions; cognitive dispositions; behavioral dispositions;
   emotional dispositions; value dispositions
AB The article suggests the author's understanding of the subjective basis of science as a form of social practice. It is argued that an adequate conceptual resource to describe the subject of scientific practice is the notion of "scientific habitus". The notion of "scientific habitus" gives an opportunity to overcome the traditional oppositions, such as corporeal/spiritual, conscious/unconscious, social/cognitive, individual/collective, and to describe heterogeneity and inhomogeneity of the subjective basis of science in integrity and unity. The structure of scientific habitus is represented by the unity of cognitive, behavioral, value and emotional dispositions. The proposed typology of the dispositional structure of scientific habit basis meets modern perceptions formed in psychology and social theory, as well as the traditions of the philosophical analysis of science. It is proved that the heterogeneity of the dispositional structure of scientific habit basis is a source of its diversity, creates a functional intensity and the variety of scientific practice. The selection of cognitive dispositions in the habit basis of scientific practice is caused by two conditions: firstly, the existence of philosophical tradition to make a difference between cognitive and value aspects; secondly, the occurrence of cognitive "turn". The cognitive dispositions form the cognitive basis of scientific practice, and their analysis indicates the diversity of forms. However, the inhomogeneity of cognitive dispositions doesn't exclude their system organization represented, for example, by ontological and epistemological category grids. The substantial variety of cognitive dispositions is shown by an example of theoretical sociology. The implementation of cognitive dispositions in communicative forms makes it possible to introduce the notion of "scientific linguistic habitus". It is shown that the variety of behavioral dispositions is embodied in the existence of different typologies: strategies of subversion and conservation (P. Bourdieu), revolutionary, standard, pragmatic, creative configurations (L. Thevenot), attainable, adaptive, regressive and destructive strategies (T. I. Zaslavsky). The value dispositions are understood as a form of intentional structure of a subject represented by attitude to certain objects and phenomena. The assumption has been made that the introduction of the notion of "moral habitus" understood as a mode of practical dispositions, which have an ethical orientation, to the analysis of the subjective basis of scientific practice is possible. The emotional dispositions are interpreted as a significant component of the habit basis of scientific practice. At the substantial level the emotional dispositions may be represented by involvement and distance, competition and cooperation, intension and relaxation. The involvement can be expressed in two forms: the involvement of people and things and the mutual involvement of people. It is emphasized that there is no possibility to receive an absolute answer about the existence of a direct causal link between different types of dispositions. It is concluded that the introduction of the notion of "scientific habitus" offers a more capacious vision of the subjective basis of science and requires a detailed research work to restore the network of dependencies and the relations of a subject with the world around.

AB There are various instances of local identity in modern Russia. However, vying with it, regional features of national identity must not contradict. At the same time, ethnic, confessional, symbolic, historical markers are being structured in local regional communities in a number of ways.
   The main actors who are totally legitimate for building local identities in political discourse are regional political elites. By the identity politics of political actors, social space is structured and "typified", and own strategies are legitimized. "Leader-electorate" relationship still remains as the key factor which can be used to manipulate public opinion.
   The article raises the issue of the current state of the political identity of the population of Volgograd Region. The results of the empirical analysis of the political identity structure are also presented. The authors conclude that the nature of the political identity of Volgograd Region population is determined mostly by its syntagmatic qualities being developed through the mismatch of ideological, electorate and personified levels of the political identity. Furthermore, key features of the political consciousness are inactivity and supineness of the people. Inhabitants prefer not to take part in policy decisions and take no responsibility.
   The achievements and the problems on the way of seeking regional political identity originated from the peculiarities of the regional dynamics are also analyzed in the work. Despite the domination of the negative ideologemes in the regional political development, sense and images of historic victories of the country are still the main unifying forces for the separate ways of thinking of Volgograd population.

AB In this paper it's showed that the accuteness of modern ethnical, confessional, intercultural conflicts makes actual the problem of forming of methodology of intercultural tolerance space building. Such methodology assumes revealing of ontological, existing foundations of tolerant intercultural interactions. At the level of existence each culture is the system of mental dominants. The system of mental dominants and mental nucleus of culture has its property of fullness and the property of effectiveness and an ability to modification. The property of fullness means that the system of mental dominants is embodied in all forms of culture, determining its qualitive originality. The property of effectiveness means its ability to self-development, to reservation of cultural identity by the interaction with other cultures. The ability to modification exists as at the level of phenomena, as at the level of essence. That means the level of change of different mental dominants by the reservation of their informative and structural invariance in general, by the preservation of its own identity. The system of mental dominants, emboding in all cultural phenomena determines not only their qualitive originality but the genesis of some or other cultural forms also. The system of mental dominants and the mental nucleus of culture has a property of originality, it becomes the basis for understanding of equivalence of all cultures. Mental nucleus of culture makes intention on self-preservation, on constant self-confirmation and crystallization of its own cultural identity, on eternal return to its existing foundation, to its dominant sources. By this given intention determines as the depth as the bounds of intercultural interactions and perceptions of different phenomena also. That is why, the space of cultural tolerance, the space of complemental and tolerant co-existence of different cultures can be realized on the basis of principles' raw. Firstly, the realization of the principle of understanding by each culture of its originality and individuality. Secondly, it is a condition of realization (sic)-(sic) equivalence of all cultures. Thirdly, it's on condition of the status of the system of mental dominants as a limit of intercultural influence.

AB Philosophical hermeneutics and analytical philosophy represent two independent types of knowledge in which, despite of its distinction in methodology and in conceptual techniques, the problem of understanding becomes the common semantic center, where all researches of these differently directed sorts of a discourse are organized around. The specific feature of understanding - how it's conceived in hermeneutical and analytical studies - is a strictly linguistic character of this phenomenon: the understanding is, first of all, an event which happens in language. And just that very event - a general moment of these contrast doctrines becomes an impulsive cause for theoretical consideration of H.-G. Gadamer and L. Wittgenstein, the founder of philosophical hermeneutics and the initiator of two main trend in analytical philosophy: logical positivism and so-called ordinary language philosophy. The reference point by Gadamer and Wittgenstein's comparison was not so much a desire for finding points of their crossing, as an attempt to show deep internal relationship which exists between two theorist of linguocentric understanding of world. Besides a widespread convergence of Wittgenstein's notion of a language-game and Gadamer's concept of game as a language's unfolding space, except an analogy inevitably comes to mind between an idea that meaning is use and dialogic nature of understanding, another words, between the late searches of Wittgenstein and hermeneutical explication of language by Gadamer - besides this fact it was revealed that the main intension of philosophical hermeneutics doesn't exceed the limits set by "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus": the world is thought of both philosophers as a language picture, and language - as a world picture. The fundamental thesis of Gadamer "being which can be understood is language" appears a mirror reflection of Wittgenstein's well-known statement "what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence"

AB The article discusses the philosophical project Derrida in the context of Western European tradition of "questioning of Being," which is in line with the attempts of historical and philosophical, ontological and categorical analysis of key concepts of deconstruction and the mystical tradition of philosophy. Using the metaphor of L. Shestov "Athens and Jerusalem" as a confrontation between faith and reason, in which compares the position of Plotinus and Dionysius Areopagite, it is concluded that in Western European philosophy, there are at least two mystical strategy of "silence of Being": Plotinian - "the silence of the mind within the mind itself" and Dionysian - "the silence of the mind beyond the mind." Analysing the concepts like Derrida "differance" and "trace" and comparing them with the theological understanding of being as incomprehensible, it is shown that Derrida is a member of the Athenian philosopher policy. The reason for the "silent ignorance" of reason from Derrida is not ontological, and epistemological in nature. With respect to the epistemological possibilities of the mind project Derrida - this alteration of the mystical discourse. In the description of the ontological structure of the world deconstruction Derrida - is not a strategy, "the silence of being," and the strategy of "at-silence of Being" and its cover-up; This - the exposure of the history of life as a philosophy of the history of blinding limb impermanence of the world and man.

DE Ethical Socialism; Moral and legal aspect of philosophy; Social
   practice; Categorical imperative and human dignity; Transcendental
   object
AB The purpose of this article is to outline those essential distinctions of ethical socialism from a radical or left socialism, namely, not in the political plane, but in respect of development of "ethical" doctrines. Why the moral and legal aspect in philosophy of ethical socialism and as Kant's categorical imperative can enrich dialectic materialism, and also show why it is better to change social reality peacefully, instead of world revolutions, hat is so important. Proceeding from Cohen, Communism as telos (goal) of history unfolds through denying the existence of the rule of law and upholds the denial here of the possibility of revolution. Thus dialectical thinking seems to exclude the possibility of non-radical change through transformative steps of laws, and calls instead for a class polarization and structural violence, regardless of the empirical conditions where it is located. The very "unjustified" violence is contrary to moral principles and the categorical imperative. The categorical imperative, which dominates in thoughts of ethical socialists, is opposed to any unjustified violence and especially terror. This means that the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat is not legitimate because it is not consistent with some philosophical reasonable and predictable ideals, according to neo-Kantian socialists, but simply because It's only the struggle of the proletariat. In other words, the practical situation of the working class in the historical process legitimizes its existence and its struggle without any doubts. Habermas argues that Marx failed to see a person as an agent, which means the both a tool-making and "symbolizing" the animals, that is - labor and language are fundamental anthropological categories in the sense, that none of these categories cannot be reduced by one other. If you start to argue, then it means a return to the Hegelian - Marxist "error" and believe that "justice will inevitably turns to the extent that what should be", what history is - the judge and "happily appears" on the side of the proletariat. In our opinion we must first define and explain what is "proper" and truth, before class of proletariat could be justified. Critical ethics is logically prior and independent of historical development and such ethics prescribes that actually preaches "ethical socialism". The article also makes some parallels to universal prescriptivism of R. M. Soviet author Oleg Drobnicki which considers that they both tried in some sense to unify Kantian universalism, his main goal is not just changing concept of historical materialism, but to bring human dignity to agenda in Soviet ethics.

DE finitism; philosophy-of-nature; universal-laws-of-conservation;
   two-valued-algebra-of-formal-axiology
AB The connection between the finitism-principle in nature-philosophy and the metaphysics of Parmenides and Melissus is investigated. The strict laws of conservation in physics, especially, the ones of conservation of energy and of electric charge are considered from the viewpoint of two-valued algebra of formal axiology. In the first part of the paper the author constructs different logical squares and hexagons of opposition of a-priori knowledge and empirical one. The two kinds of knowledge and their contrariness are precisely defined by means of compositions of epistemic, alethic, and axiological modalities. The first logical square and hexagon considered in the paper are graphic models of the system of logical interrelations among "knowledge that p", "empirical knowledge that p", "a-priori knowledge that p", and "alethic necessity of p". The second square and hexagon are graphic models of the system of logical interrelations among "knowledge that it is good that p", "empirical knowledge that it is good that p", "a-priori knowledge that it is good that p", and "alethic necessity (of the situation) that it is good that p". The third square and hexagon are graphic models of the system of logical interrelations among the contrary epistemic modalities "a-priori knowledge" and "empirical one" precisely defined by means of epistemic, alethic and axiological modalities. These square and hexagon combine the three modality types in such a hypothetical synthesis which heads to a couple of problems. Firstly, the synthesis of the two previous figures by the third ones contradicts to the universality of the principle of logical autonomy between statements about being and ones about value. This contradiction is eliminated by formally defined restriction of the scope of relevant applicability of the mentioned autonomy principle: applying this principle is relevant if and only if it is applied to empirical knowledge; in sphere of a-priori one it is not relevantly applicable. From the submitted definitions it follows logically that if some knowledge is a-priori one then it is one of necessarily good. If so then if the strict laws of conservation in physics represent a-priori knowledge, then they represent knowledge of necessarily good. Hence the laws-of-conservation of energy and the ones of electric charge are laws of formal axiology. This consequence is examined by means of two-valued algebra of formal axiology. The result is positive.

DE typology; wholeness; contemporary cognitive strategy
AB The article noted the critical state of methodology of scientific knowledge. It is shown that one of the causes of this crisis was the displacement of the qualitative constructions of the world to the quantitative strategy that emerged in the New era. The article considers the typological constructions as a modus of wholeness project. With this purpose, presents logical and methodological comparison of typology with such forms of systematization of knowledge as classification and theory. Modeling and typologization are constructive in its core processes. The article contains a reference to their cognitive difference. Marked the orientation of typological constructs to "become", "taken out" from the context of actual life, which leads to the understanding of the special ontological status of the typological constructions. Shown genetic weave of systematic approach and wholeness concepts, marked the evolution of the system approach, connected with the appearance of synergetics, which brings new insight and meaning in the typological representations, allowing to speak about the development of a holistic understanding of the objective world. The article notes the productive value of typological constructions for modern integrative processes, different variants of the comparative analysis, especially comparative studies. Art culture also uses typological generalizations for understanding created in her images. Noted that typological constructions include cognitive freedom, as well as logical and methodological rules. The development of typological concepts leads to increased consideration as an independent cognitive reception, the formation of a "presumption of tipologicaly" the formation of prohibiting the identification of the concept "type" with its concrete expression, that extends their cognitive capabilities. The philosophy of wholeness gradually grows into a modern methodological culture and helps to resolve its crisis on the basis of a new philosophical paradigm associated with the ontology of the whoiness.

TI ON THE TERMINOLOGICAL MEANING OF LANGUAGE ITEMS OF ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY

   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE

DT Article
DE ancient philosophy; sage; philosopher; sophist; eros; logos
AB The article deals with the language items: words and phrases that characterize the ancient philosophy. They can be a concept, image, symbol, term; or perform the functions of any other rather than inherent in the item itself. The description of the formation of the term and its comprehension can be viewed from two perspectives. The process of acquiring terminological meaning by the rational and emotional forms of thinking is connected with the features of historical development. Therefore it is important to turn to the etymology revealing the origin of meaning and content of the language items under consideration. Comprehension occurs in the reverse perspective (teleological) when the established meaning (its implementation) - entelechy serves to guarantee the accuracy and clarity of the term which is still being formed. It refers to the term 'ancient philosophy' and to the others (e.g., eros, logos) which disclose both their meanings and the content of key term. In Plato's time there was the word philosophy. Its mission is to choose terminology significant definition from existing images, words and concepts, showing way of life and thought of the philosopher. The discrepancy of substance significant and terminology status naming is revealed. In Plato's dialogues the development of concepts enthusiasm, pathos, ecstasy, and a number of others is focused in Eros, terminologically fixed in philia. Philia is a concept similar to Eros, but etymologically it has more moderate qualities: inclination, interest. It conveys the importance of activity imbued with love for true wisdom. The second part of the term philosophy is sophia, word-symbol. The notions of logos and ratio are important for understanding the theme of Sophia. Logos tends to be spiritually inexhaustible and symbolic, it confronts the myth in terms of rationality, but as the word and thought of the Divine it is spirit that is not subject to the rigidity of ratio. The conceptual development of the absolute, pretersensual and ratio is focused on the Logos, terminologically fixed in sophia. Difficulty in studying the terminological meaning is conditioned by a variety of research experience, philosophical and methodological orientations of particular stage of philosophical historiography. Complicated language forms (symbols, images) are involved in the formation of the term, metaphoricity and emotional nature of the words should be taken into account. This creates ambiguity, variability, openness of the meaning that ensures the vitality and viability of ancient philosophy.

DE project; regional publishing house and publisher; Tomsk environment
AB The article analyzes the possibility of integration of the project category in the field of book publishing, which involves the study of the relevant theoretical framework and experience of Tomsk book publishing, as well as the development of the concept of an original publishing project. The relevance and novelty of the work consists in referring to the activities of the Tomsk publisher E.A. Kolchuzhkin in the context of the project category.
   At the end of the 20th century, in spite of the intricate economic and political processes, the book continues to be an integral part of people's lives. Fiction was the priority. Books about the Great Patriotic War and the so-called entertaining literature were second and third popular. Edition on socio-political topics, historical and memoir works, special literature and books on philosophy were also in demand. It was at this time that the original project of Kolchuzhkin, similar to the central Russia projects of the publishing houses "Vagrius", "Zakharov" or "Slovo", appears. Vodoley was an example of an original multi-project in a regional environment; its subprojects were united by a single concept, themes, mission and time. In this sense Kolchuzhkin's project is a concept that brings together all the works he published. Mission, aim, cultural experience - all these contributed to its implementation. During the country's critical years Vodoley was practically the first private non-state publishing house in a Siberian city.
   The article discusses the repertoire policy, book distribution channels and ways to promote the publishing house in Moscow (the promotion was successfully completed in 2002). When Vodoley moved to Moscow, it was headed by the Russian science fiction writer, literary critic, poet and translator E.V. Vitkovskiy, who initiated many projects. In the capital, Vodoley retained its former publishing activity; new publishing projects were also initiated. For instance, it began publishing contemporary Russian poetry focused on the classical tradition.
   Thus, the Vodoley publishing house was the cultural experience in Tomsk that today's publishers must account for, if they do not want to be simple printing houses that serve individuals, but publishing houses in their classical meaning. Today, Vodoley is a formed brand which readers associate with intellectual literature.

DE truth-grounds; logical consequence; internal relations
AB The aim of this article is to analyze the early Wittgenstein's concept of logical consequence. Wittgen-stein rejects Frege and Russell's views about some real laws of inference which can supposedly justify our moving from one proposition that is accepted as true to another. On the contrary - as postulates in 5.132 - if one proposition follows from another then only these two propositions themselves without any laws of inference can justify the inference. In order to show what does it means I consider the notion of truth-grounds. Truth-grounds of a proposition are by definition those truth-possibilities of its truth-arguments that make it true. And I argue that in cases of propositions from statement 5.101 which are truth-functions of two elementary propositions the best illustration of how does their truth-grounds can determine their structures is so-called Gergonne's relations. I argue that basing on exactly such structures Wittgenstein rejects "laws of inference". Valid inference from q to p, as Wittgenstein sees it, is a matter of p being contained in q - and also depends on truth-grounds and particular structures in logical space.

AB The subject of the paper is the problem of the two various interpretations of definite descriptions as it is presented in the article of E.V. Borisov "On Two Interpretations of Definite Descriptions". In this article definite descriptions are considered both as singular terms and individuating predicates. From the point of view of E.V. Borisov these interpretations demand to interpret the sentence copula as expressing the identity or the subject-predicate relation. The possibilities of such approach are analyzed in the paper. It is proved, that approach of E.V. Borisov is possible only under the condition of ignoring of the distinction between primary and secondary occurrence of logical constants, which denotation phrases contain. It is proved that the relational understanding of the copula is not removable generally, if it is necessary to keep distinction between primary and secondary occurrence of logic constants in the statements which are used definite descriptions.

The main thesis of Rorty - irreducibility of being-for-itself (pour-soi) to being-in-itself (en-soi) - is analyzed in this regard. Adoption by Rorty the linguistic turn in philosophy leads him to some form of linguistic existentialism, which is consistent with the statement of the absence transcendental ego in Sartre's philosophy.

AB In the question about the origin of man E. Husserl remains methodologically consistent, offering a range of original phenomenological solutions. An important part of understanding anthropogenesis is clarification border aspects of consciousness. The problem of anthropogenesis is a rationale for the ability of the mind/body through the appreciation of the transcendental first sources, and not only consciousness, but also, more broadly, the great phenomena of "subjectivity". Anthropogenesis is considered from the perspective of consciousness, own the Genesis of which, according to Husserl, is an instant "jog" in nature. Husserl argues that, because the phenomenological sphere constrained within specific subjective temporal, the process of birth is available outside the immediate consciousness of the experience - it is constitutive for its "borders". The overcoming of this cognitive boundaries is solved them through the exit to the problem of the House, the Other, and in General - to the aspect of intersubjectivity. In the framework of the birth process involved in generative transmission of sense, integrated in the absorption and new regulatory structures that anticipate predecessors and revised followers through traditions, stories, rituals, breaks, generations, rites of passage and so on. Ideological moves Husserl concerning themes of origin, covering a range of issues. Among them the history of world knowledge about the origin, and the problem of transgression, and clarification of the modes of the original inaccessibility and incomprehensibility "alien", and co-constituting the "foreign" geohistorical areas, and mandatory even for phenomenology historical density of "his". His works are studies of "borders" analogical appresentation animal statement, phenomenological "transcendent" animal statement to the human consciousness, non-entity "boundaries" of animals and people, meaning "living body", gender distinctions, constituting concepts of normality and abnormality, coherence and consistency, the possibility of objectivation of the border, the idea of bodily-mental integrity of a person.

AB The article considers current status and trends of Russian-Chinese cooperation in the banking sector. Firstly, it examines scope of activities and main results of specialized inter-state mechanism of deepening inter-bank cooperation between Russia and China. Secondly, a detailed analysis of Chinese banking institutions' operations in the Russian market is given. The author points out that until now the main reasons for the Chinese banks' activities in the Russian market have political nature while purely commercial considerations are of secondary importance. The client base mainly consists of Chinese companies and enterprises doing their business in Russia. The revenues of Chinese banks here are primarily generated by interest income. Chinese banks demonstrate low-key approach to searching of new and expansion of existing areas of their business. There is no evidence of major expansion in investment and lending to local businesses, deepening work in the retail sector, etc. Chinese banks retain limited geographical presence in Russia. Thirdly, the scope and trends of Russian banks' activities in China are analyzed. The author explains extremely weak presence of Russian banks in China (including Hong Kong) and lack of dynamism in their operations in the local market. The key problems are singled out. Mostly, they are determined by the specifics of the Chinese banking sector functioning. In particular, tangible complexity persists in attracting funding from Chinese banks. The documentary operations (letters of credit, factoring) are not yet actively used in the work with the Chinese market. The commercial incentives to work with China remain small for the Russian banks. A general conclusion is drawn that in short term one should not expect any serious penetration of Russian banks into the PRC.

AB The paper summarizes immigration policy models in Germany, France, the UK, the USA and Canada in response to the growing immigration flows since the second half of the XXth century. By contrast with "traditional" nation states of Western Europe, the USA and Canada have developed on the basis of the settler colonies having melted immigrants of various ethnic and cultural origins. The USA and Canada have been prioritizing immigration as a factor of their national development. Although public culture in these immigration states has been developing on some specific cultural patterns, American and Canadian societies have not generated the concepts and perceptions of an "ethno-cultural" core of the nation as such. One of the reasons for current integration issues in the West is the struggle of immigrants for their collective cultural rights in host societies. Differences in political culture between Western European states and immigration states (the USA and Canada in this case) determine the gap in the institutionalization of collective rights for immigrants and, correspondingly, specific character of integration issues. Transition to the pluralistic model of national integration in the USA and Canada is determined by the following factors. First, due to mass immigration, there emerged liberalization of immigration policies. Secondly, in the post-war period, political cultures in liberal democracies witnessed a pronounced republican tendency, due to the ideological influence generated in times of The African-American Civil Rights Movement.

AB Chemistry, in the opinion of chemists studying its history, is both science and production. Chemical knowledge combined enduring problem: getting materials with desired properties. For understanding the specifics of methodological consciousness in chemistry subject of our analysis was a long discussion between chemists Proust and Berthollet which took place in XIX century. Proust won the dispute, relying on chemical picture of reality (CPR) formed in the process of integrating the Lavoisier's chemical element teaching with Dalton's atomistics. Proust won Berthollet due to the fact that the objects of his study obey the law of definite proportions, simple multiple proportions and equivalents. It may seem that full compliance of the prevailing ideas of the winning side with atomic and molecular paradigm leaves no room for fruitful researches to defeated Berthollet's supporters. The latter advocated continuous forms of the substance which was confirmed in experimental studies with objects such as solutions and alloys which were considered by Proust as physical mixtures. Misunderstanding was due to the fact that at low levels of physical and analytical experimental equipment it was impossible to distinguish chemical compounds from physical mixtures. Considering that there was no unanimity about the interpretation of many concepts and especially the theory of chemical affinity, an unambiguous assessment of the debate can't be considered as credible. In this situation Berthollet proposed the idea of chemical affinity dependency on many factors. It founds the approval and support of many influential chemists working with solutions. Their theoretical generalization, extrapolations, and analogies on the identification of the nature of chemical equilibrium dissociation had led to the discovery of transition (relative daltonidnoy and bertollidnoy) form of matter organization - activated complex. It can be stated that the functioning of the methodological consciousness in scientific chemistry is provided by its interconnection with production that allow using resources of different paradigms widely.

AB The paper specifies current politico-social situation in Chile, in particular the challenges associated with wide-scale public expectations of recent years, with development and expansion of radical and protest moods. While pointing at the advantages of Chilean development model shown over the period of 1990-2014 (namely, successful transition to democracy, efficient economy and large-scale social policy) the author turns to the analysis of the causes of political turbulence that acutely emerged at a time of President S. Pinera (2010-2014) in the form of mass youth's protests against unpopular project of educational reform which has been proposed by the government. Against the background of rising of protest moods, supported in a greater degree by young students, and the mass social expectations, the author is dealing with different domestic and foreign policy challenges facing M. Bachelet, the newly elected President (2014-2018). This refers to implementing the promised educational reform focused on principles of free-of charge and affordability for everybody, the electoral system reform extending the area of political participation for small parties, to adoption a new Constitution. The new democratic government of Chile faces very serious challenge domestically. On the one hand, Chilean electorate demands to secure more social equality within the nation. On the other hand, there is an obvious need to promote more effective, dynamic development for creation competitive marketable economy. The article considers the first steps of M. Bachelet concerning tax and education reform, positions of the pro-Presidential parties and the center-right opposition. Finally, the author deals with the main aspects of Chile's foreign policy agenda, in particular, participation in the Pacific Alliance, delimitation of a new sea border between Peru and Chile, as well as dealing with Bolivia's claim to provide it an outlet to the sea via Chilean territory.

DT Book Review
DE collective action; rationality; economic disinterest; collective good;
   culture; cultural producer; embeddedness
AB Lyn Spillman's new book Solidarity in Strategy: Making Business Meaningful in American Trade Associations considers the historical development and evolution of American business associations and their role in the contemporary economic system as a special organizational form of interactions among business actors. In the broadest sense, Spillman argues that associations are "cultural producers for economic action" [Spillman: 79]. Moreover, the author pays attention to the association's ability to survive under complex economic and political conditions. Spillman analyzes the processes through which associations have transformed from unstable, redundant and limited "dinner clubs" to powerful and authoritative structures, wielding practical tools for solving complex market objectives.
   The book review addresses the issue of theoretical background of the book, and more precisely this review focuses on Lyn Spillman's synthesis of Weber's conception of self interest with Durkheim's view of collective action. In terms of this framework Lyn Spillman argues against a conventional statement that associations are solely a conspiracy of manufacturers who narrowly target to act against consumer. In contrast, business actors are seen to be altruistic, focusing on the collective good and group identification rather than egoistic or placing profit center stage. All in all, the aim of this book review is to represent Spillman's key ideas, analyze the author's logic and finally endeavor to grasp how and to whom this book could be beneficial and where it might be implemented.

DT Article
DE higher education; business schools; France; student immigration;
   educational emigration; unemployment; generation of "Tanguy"
AB Considering current problems of the higher education system in France, a number of problems can be identified. On one hand, the traditional high school encourages the intelligence, the elite formation, the deepening of existing social inequalities. On the other hand, the professional training largely focused on the labor market is expected. The contradiction between supply and demand (a demand for young professionals), the lack of opportunities for career growth at home force young Frenchmen to leave the country, which is the major issue in higher education and French society as a whole. At the same time, the educational immigration to France is increasing. The problems of coexistence of different cultures and worldviews in higher education remain actual. Such problems as "difficult" neighborhoods and employment among young people, their professional, cultural orientation, changing attitudes towards the teaching profession are important, too. The article contains the analysis of current trends and prospects of higher education, as well as of the policy being pursued by the government towards the young generation. The estimation of the present state of higher school by well known French sociologists experts in the field of youth policy (Olivier Galland, Francois Dubet and others) is presented in the paper. The analogy with problems of the Russian higher education system, in particular higher commercial schools, is noticed. Fighting for youth remains the main theme in modern France. The social climate in the country may be improved by means of the young peoples' "remobilization", using their dynamism, their knowledge and educational level which is one of the highest in Europe. The creation of prospects for self-realization at home (better conditions for an entrepreneurial activity and a political career etc.) may be considered as an alternative to the departure of young people abroad.

AB The author of the article analyses the role of Canada's Prime Minister W.L. Mackenzie King in the creation of the unique Canadian political culture. The basis for this political culture was represented not only by the British political system, the adopted ideology of English classical liberalism, but also the national historical and cultural traditions connected with one and a half century existence of two nations on the North American continent.
   The author confirms that the Liberal Party and Mackenzie King as its leader decided upon the wide modernization of the Canadian society in the conditions of the post-war reconstruction in 1920s. This process would have been impossible without the reorganization of the political culture.
   The change of political practice allowed the autonomy to obtain more rights and the sovereignty. That is why M.King held two posts during almost the whole period - as Prime Minister and as Minister of Foreign Affairs. This approach helped him to have significant influence on the external political aspect in the development of the Canadian political culture.
   The author of the article points the main seven directions in the political activity of Mackenzie King which contributed to the creation of the unique Canadian political culture.
   The author concludes that the influence of Mackenzie King on the creation of the Canadian political culture was crucial in the second half of the 20th Century.

TI GERMAN POLICY TOWARDS EU ENLARGEMENT

DT Article
DE Germany; European Integration; EU enlargement
AB This article is dedicated to the German policy towards the EU enlargement. Its history as well as the current German policy towards prospective enlargements are analyzed in this paper. The article offers party-political and sociological analysis of Germany's attitude towards the EU enlargement, also the reasons for it are determined. FRG supported all of the European Community and European Union enlargements. This line is being continued, but nowadays only step to step approach is being supported. Germany's motives to the EU enlargement are based on the liberal concept of the common secutity. The main goals of this policy are the including of European countries into the Western community of developed countries (the EU), the extension of the stability and secutiry area. The economic integraiton is also very important for Germany. The key priority of the EU enlargement is the Western Balkan region (the so called "Europeanisation" of Western Balkans). This process in being supported by political elites of the region and by the European Union itself. It is recognised, that the Europeanisation of Western Balkans was used as a sample for the Eastern Partnership Program. Without consideration of the Russian factor, though, this strategy towards the post-soviet countries has many weaknesses. But the EU-membership for the Eastern Partnership members is not excluded.

TI GLOBAL GOVERNANCE AND DIASPORAS: THE CASE OF AFRICAN MIGRANTS IN THE USA

ID WORLD
AB In 2013, the Institute for African Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences began a study of black communities in the USA. By now, the research was conducted in six states (Alabama, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Pennsylvania); in a number of towns as well as in the cities of Boston, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia and Chicago. The study shows that diasporas as network communities have already formed among recent migrants from many African countries in the U.S. These are diasporas of immigrants from individual countries, not a single "African diaspora". On one hand, diasporas as an important phenomenon of globalization should become objects of global governance by means of regulation at the transnational level of both migration streams and foreign-born communities norms of existence. On the other hand, diasporas can be agents of social and political global governance, of essentially transnational impact on particular societies and states sending and accepting migrants, as evidenced by the African diasporas in the USA. Most American Africans believe that diasporas must and can take an active part in the home countries' public life. However, the majority of them concentrates on targeted assistance to certain people - their loved ones back home. The forms of this assistance are diverse, but the main of them is sending remittances. At the same time, the money received from migrants by specific people makes an impact on the whole society and state. For many African states these remittances form a significant part of national income. The migrants' remittances allow the states to lower the level of social tension. Simultaneously, they have to be especially thorough while building relationships with the migrant accepting countries and with diasporas themselves. Africans constitute an absolute minority among recent migrants in the USA. Nevertheless, directly or indirectly, they exert a certain influence on the establishment of the social life principles and state politics (home and foreign), not only of native countries but also of the accepting one, the U.S. This props up the argument that elaboration of norms and setting the rules of global governance is a business of not only political actors, but of the globalizing civil society, its institutions and organizations either. The most recent example are public debates in the American establishment, including President Obama, on the problem of immigration policy and relationships with migrant sending states, provoked by the 2014 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. Remarkably, the African diasporas represented by their leaders actively joined the discussion and openly declared that the state pays insufficiently little attention to the migrants' needs and insisted on taking their position into account while planning immigration reform. However, Africans are becoming less and less "invisible" in the American society not only in connection with loud, but infrequent specific events. Many educated Africans who have managed to achieve a decent social status and financial position for themselves, have a desire not just to promote the adaptation of migrants from Africa, but to make their collective voice heard in American society and the state at the local and national levels. Their efforts take different forms, but most often they result in establishing and running of various diaspora organizations. These associations become new cells of the American civil society, and in this capacity affect the society itself and the government institutions best they can.
   Thus, the evidence on Africans in the USA shows that diasporas are both objects (to date, mainly potential) and real subjects of global governance. They influence public life, home and foreign policy of the migrant sending African countries and of migrant accepting United States, make a modest but undeniable contribution to the global phenomena and processes management principles and mechanisms.

DE experimental method in political sciences; Russian Federation; regional
   legislatures; transparency; meeting citizen's appeals
AB An experimental method is becoming more and more popular in contemporary political sciences. In this paper the experimental research of the Russian regional legislatures' informational openness and availability is presented. The parliaments were addressed with a standard appeal claiming for a set of formal data describing the organizational and political structure of the legislative body during the last two convocations - total number of deputies in a regional parliament, number of deputies working on a permanent basis, total number of fractions and their size. The experiment was performed both via phone calls and e-mail letters. The results obtained show a medium level of availability of regional representative bodies and a low level of transparency. Only the half of the regional legislatures showed a certain level of ability to work with a private citizen's appeal and only 9 of them completely met the standards of formal procedure, established by federal and regional laws, and provided the requested information. In 19 cases the regional parliaments turned out to be unavailable for a citizen's appeal - either an official representative of the body rejected the claim or officially specified telephone numbers were irregular. The experiment and the results of more conventional ways of investigating the problems of transparency via official websites' monitoring. During the experiment it was found that Russian regional authorities are rarely open and cooperative with citizens.

DE imperial theatres; revolution of 1917 in Russia; a duel; RB Apollonsky;
   VE Meyerhold
AB In the beginning of April 1917 a conflict burst out in the troupe of the Alexandrinsky Theatre: a number of prominent actors brought an accusation of aesthetic and political nature against director V.E. Meyerhold. The immediate reason for this was Meyerhold's act - the director attended the meeting of "theatrical figures" convened by F.A. Golovin, the Commissioner of the Provisional government, not being among the persons elected to participate in the meeting of the troupe. In particular, artist R.B. Apollonsky compared V.E. Meyerhold with a famous friend of Nicholas II - G.E. Rasputin. Therefore, having ignored the accusations in "modernism", he reacted harshly to the comparison with Rasputin. Outraged by this, Meyerhold called Apollonsky out to a duel. As a result, the duel did not take place, but the story was covered in press in unfriendly to Meyerhold light. The author concludes that Meyerhold represented in press after the February Revolution as a representative of the "old regime", during this period was trying to distance himself from the fallen monarchy, actively assimilating the radical vocabulary. The isolation of Meyerhold in the circles of theater community took place after the described incident and was likely to make it easier for him in future to join the party of Bolsheviks.

TI POLITICAL AND ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF PARTY SYSTEMS' TRANSFORMATION IN

SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE political parties; economic voting; political protest; identity;
   expressive behavior; Euroskepticism; the EU
AB The paper attempts to study how economic situation in the member countries of the European Union in 2005-2011 affected the national party systems' attitude towards the EU and the European integration (the EU cleavage). The authors made suggestion that economic decline could result in growing Euroskepticism. This hypothesis was derived from three main arguments: economic voting theory, suggesting that voters "punish" the ruling parties in case of economic decline; the role the EU plays in determining national economic policy (specifically, strict austerity requirements); the overall international context of global economic crisis. In order to measure the attitude of the national parties towards the EU, the data from the Manifesto Project Database (MPD), a large scale content analysis database of electoral promises (manifestos) of national political parties was applied. Then the authors looked at 41 elections in the EU member states in 2005-2011, for which MPD data are available, and measured the declared position of the parties participating in the elections regarding the EU. In an econometric study, the proxies of national party systems attitudes were regressed on proxies of economic situation in the EU countries, attempting to test the main hypotheses. Specifically, four proxies of attitude towards the EU were used: the share of votes obtained by euroskeptical parties; the average level of Euroskepticism in national party manifestos of all parties participating in elections; the average level of Euroskepticism of the ruling coalition emerging from elections; the average level of Euroskepticism weighted by the share of votes obtained by particular parties. The results of the estimates do not confirm that economic indicators (especially GDP and inflation) have had a significant impact on the Euroskepticism; the results are not robust and vary from specification to specification. The article shows, however, that higher unemployment levels are negatively correlated with Euroskepticism. The authors explain these findings by the predominance of expressive behavior in voting patterns in Europe. Specifically, they argue that voting was driven primarily by identity issue. However, in this case identity should be related not to ethnic or regional features, but to consumption behavior patterns. The results are also placed in a broader context, attempting to link the EU-specific findings to processes observed in other parts of the world.

That's why main conclusions which were made on this material can be extrapolated to all social space of country.
   The authors choose four ethno-caste groups, which represent the majority in untouchables and the three smallest in jaties. Their positions in regional hierarchy and economic specialization are analyzed in detail. There are a lot of information about their number, social structure, literacy rating, endogamy, day-to-day practices, customs and other features. Special accents were pointed on mind orientation of their elites toward integration in modern society or, conversely, toward the conservation of traditional forms of existence.
   The issues of origin and social evolution of untouchable castes of Uttar Pradesh are examined. There is assessment of castes' sanskritization or other forms of social self-development. The quality of "scheduled" castes social environment is analyzed. As a marks of its positiveness the data about discrimination untouchables from other social groups and degree of political representativeness of "scheduled" castes, accessibility of education and labour were chosen.
   The conclusions were made about development degree of some castes. The factors that play role in positive changes in contemporary conditions were determined. The authors put forward their own hypothesis of future development of untouchable castes in Uttar Pradesh. Empiric base of this article was established on sources that have Indian origin and historical and social research of outstanding western indologies.

DT Article
DE Thailand; democracy; Taksin Sinavatra; political situation; political
   establishment; military coup d'etat; middle class
AB The political development of Thailand in XXIth century is characterized by a deep split of the society into opponents and supporters of democratization. The latter are consolidated around the figure of Taksin Sinavatra, the former prime minister. He was overthrown by the military in 2006, but still enjoys the support of the popular majority he gained due to his economic policy aimed at improving the life conditions of the poor in periphery regions. The triumph of his parties in elections since 2001 caused the new power balance in politics traditionally viewed as a focal area of the political establishment - the representatives of the Bangkok upper and middle classes only. The marginalization of their position in the political system and the impossibility of coming to power through elections determined their integration into the anti government movement, for the purpose of cancelling the representative democracy system that doesn't meet the interests of the traditional political elite finding itself in a "minority" and unwilling to be under the reign of a "majority". The deepening of the political crisis provoked the military into undertaking the coup d'etat in May 2014 and establishing an authoritarian regime, which ensured the accrescency of power for the traditional elite. Nevertheless, as the author concludes, the future political development of Thailand seems unclear. The power of military in cooperation with their civilian followers is unlikely to reconcile the society, split by class differences and political aspirations. The contemporary political development of Thailand reflects the situation when the "populace" doesn't want just to remain under control any longer, and the "upper strata" refuses to be under the rule of the electoral majority. The main question raised today is not of the Taksin's destiny, but of an alternative for the Thailand's future political development - restricted democracy directed by upper classes, or representative democracy.

AB The idea of the article is to find the measure of social distancing of the subjects in the political space in the region. Based on the conceptual framework are the concepts and types of social distance, the criteria by which changes the social distance.
   Currently, actualized the issue of the measure of distancing regions from the Federal center, the system of local government from the regional level of government, which is a meso-level, but with the state powers of federal subjects. In the sociology, the search of measuring instruments and the measure of distancing related to the understanding the meaning of the concept of "region". Supposed the segmentation of the political space, dividing it into localized areas which available for micro-sociological analysis.
   Social distance is a measure of how deeply rooted in society and in what configuration, there is status differences, privileges, positions and so on. The degree of proximity or detachment relations between subjects measures the factorial and intersubjective impacts exerted another subject in the political space in the region. There are the following types of social distance on the criterion the length of the distance between statuses: normal distance situationally shorter distance, abnormally short distance, abnormally long distance.
   The mobility of political subjects within the boundaries of political space becomes a stimulant of changing social distances, which at initial placement gave the space a different configuration. Changes in social distance can be traced to the following criteria: the direction of the change; the character of the interactions; the intensity of the mobility in the space; the relationship of social and political space to ensure the interaction of political subjects.
   One could argue that social distance is an instrument measuring status-hierarchical relationships of the authority and the population. Under the conditions of the region to measure social distance is necessary to outline the social space with the help of sensors - measuring instruments that reflect the social identity, status-hierarchical affiliation of interacting subjects in the region.
   The political component of the region related to the specific relationship of interacting subjects, ways of exercising power, the level of political creativity and the character of political participation. The positions between subjects define "real" measurement of intra-regional distancing. The interchange of social and natural resources are the basis of status-hierarchical arrangement of social subjects in the political space in the region.
   The mobility and the variability of subjects positions in the political space determine the mechanism of action of the optimal allocation of these subjects in the political space in the region. The dominant motivation of subjects in politics leads to purposeful rearrangement of the positions and of the change of formal distances.

DE religion; the nomadic culture; hierarchical culture; the mentality
AB This article analyzes the processes taking place in the religious life of modern Russia. Observed at the turn of the century outbreak of religiosity is due not only socio-economic and ideological reasons, but also the features of the Russian mentality, in which the formation of the important role played by religion. Actualization of faith in modern conditions is not of a nature of the understanding and execution of religious commandments, and shall be in an empty ritualization. Most often observed phenomenon of religious syncretism, chaotic connections of some aspects of different religions. From the point of view of the authors of this is due to the loss of the original synthesis of nomadic and hierarchical worldview, which is the most promising for the successful development of the society. Nomadic culture is more capable of self-independence community to nominate leaders of the masses. Hierarchical culture is characterized by centralization of authority, strict control and management. Adequate synthesis of these types of culture promotes the viability of the social organism, the development of successful economies, forming the leadership potential of man. The success of socialist construction in the USSR authors see in the intuitive achieve this synthesis, which was destroyed in the post-Soviet period. Analyzing the features of the Russian mentality, the authors draw attention to the accentuation of the traditional religions of spiritual labor, moral self-improvement, rather than labor, aimed at achieving material prosperity. Protestantism, which is actively exploring new territory and acquires followers in Russia, Buryatia, unlike Orthodoxy, Islam, Buddhism, and updates the leadership potential in their followers, directing their efforts to solve financial problems, to improve the quality of their lives here and now. Noting arose among Muslim philosophers of dialogue about the need for ijtihad, the authors talk about the need to reform the ethical foundations of world religions in order to create a new mentality, a more appropriate challenges.

DE cultural politics; media; regional culture; media picture; cultural
   institute; cultural requirements; cultural capital
AB First of all demanded changes in cultural politics are connected with the cultural institutes configuration development: discovering new cultural model and changes in economic affairs (representing the new management forms, marketing and culture). Every Russian region has its own cultural politics. In the Tomskaya oblast (Tomsk region) politics is focused on availability of cultural services and preservation of cultural and historical heritage. This work supposed to be done with a minimal budget. Image aspects of cultural politics are analyzed through a prism, in which cultural life is reflected in the regional media.
   In this article a content analysis was made in purpose to determinate the media picture of Tomsk, as a cultural center reflected in the regional media scene (2011 - 2013). Such channels as "TB-2" and "(sic)" were chosen for the content analysis. Printed presses, such as "(sic)" and "(sic)", were also involved. The local TV channels were checked for the relevant information, which includes architecture, monuments, cinematography, literature, music, museums and holidays. Furthermore we identified attitude marks for cultural events. For the noticed period the amount of cultural reports was mentioned 559 times.
   According to the results of media-audit analysis, we can say that Tomsk culture is positively estimated. The most mentioned topic on TV is "Museum" and "Exhibitions", than goes "Music" and on the third place is "Holidays". Very small amount of events is connected with charity (concerts, exhibitions and other charitable activities). By contrast with that, there were a great number of reports about Theatre (78 times).
   Exploring the speech act modality, it was concluded that Tomsk culture received high opinions. Over a third of reports had positive modality, less than two-thirds were neutrally estimated and only three present were negatively described.
   At the same time the analysis also indicated discordance of opinions about coverage of cultural events. Media experts think that the television covers enough cultural news. As for cultural experts, their point of view is opposite.
   According to the results of cultural field analysis, (regional politics and media scene) Tomsk media cover the cultural part only in case of commercial interest.
   As for cultural politic realization, we can conclude that state-centered model predominates in Tomsk, while there is a need for transformation into market economy model.

DE charity; social support; placement; practice
AB The article examines the practice of orphan children's placement in pre-revolutionary Russia. It considers the activities of major organizations such as the Department of Institutions of Empress Maria and the Imperial Philanthropic Society. The article compares the methods and results of the work of these institutions.
   The placement and care of orphans has been one of the key issues in social policy in the Russian state for almost three hundred years. But today the problem is still acute. Some of the causes of orphanhood have persisted independently of socioeconomic, political, and ethical eras.
   The article discusses the evolution of the practices of the placement of orphans in pre-revolutionary Russia by two major pro-government charitable institutions - the Department of Institutions of Empress Maria and the Imperial Philanthropic Society.
   In pre-revolutionary Russia, there was a wide range of methods for the placement of orphans, from adoption and guardianship to training for any profession and assignment to a specific class (based on the child's knowledge, abilities and skills). The use of marriage as a form of placement is also considered.
   The article points out the problems that occurred during the development of the institution of orphans' placement. These represented in most cases the elementary shortage of funds and the neglect of duties by some officials. They were associated with the weakening of the control of the central oversight authorities in the institutions concerned. The application of supervisory measures fluctuated: it weakened, then sharply increased (in the opinion of analysts of the time).
   Thus, the article examines the main forms of orphans' placement and care practiced in the Department of Institutions of Empress Maria and by the Imperial Philanthropic Society.

AB The urgency of implementing social policies in rural areas, key actors in this area, existing problems faced by both the people and the officials - these aspects are central to the framework of this article. The author proceeds to consideration of the topic by analyzing the current state of rural social sphere, the results of investigations carried out by the modern practice, focuses on the major problems encountered in implementing social policies at the level of rural settlements. Further, under the article, the author focuses on the definition of those groups whose members are able to solve problems and ensure a stable social situation of the inhabitants; reveals who and what bodies are key actors in social policy in the countryside.
   So, are the following:
   Representatives of regional and district municipal authorities;
   Representatives of the executive branch of the rural settlements;
   Representative bodies of rural settlements;
   Representatives of political parties, communities, associations, rural intelligentuals (teachers, doctors, business elite).
   In the course of the characteristics of each group, the author emphasizes the leading role of the representative bodies of rural settlements, but at the same time represents a number of obstacles to their work (economic, cognitive, communicative, psychological).
   In conclusion, the author comes to the following conclusion: there is an imbalance between the authority of the representative bodies of rural settlements in the field of social policy and tools / knowledge / communicative competences / desire. Only in the case between the authority and the means / knowledge / communicative competence / desire will be equal sign, vector of social policy development in rural areas will be directed upwards. Otherwise, talk about positive changes in this part is utopian.

DE values; methodology of research; empirical sociology; integral approach

AB The article examines different ways of studying values, which gives an opportunity to broaden the horizons of the dominating empirical quantitative approach in modern Russian Sociology to the study of this problem. Holistic approach to the study of values in the context of post non-classical science, focusing on methodology of K. Wilber is formulated. There are only a few publications by other authors in the area of post non-classical science, which demonstrates that there is a gap that needs to be filled focusing on the studied topic. The fact that the most widespread types of rationality in the modern science are classical and non-classical ones, also determines the specifics of the study of value consciousness. In such studies an individual is implicitly viewed as a "product" of social and economic system, where the system is a primary determinant of other factors. Also, on the basis of analysis of such studies, one can make a conclusion that values (or "value orientations") are regarded as some sort of external objects that, like physical characteristics, can be identified and measured mostly with the help of closed type of questions in a questionnaire. Most often quantitative research is conducted, which, as it is known, provides average statistical knowledge about the studied phenomena and does not give an opportunity to study the inner world of an individual in its depth and wholeness. Also, values are usually understood as evaluations of certain facts by respondents.
   The article aims at proving that a more holistic picture of the studied phenomena can be provided also by qualitative research, as well as interdisciplinary and integral studies. Positive aspects and resources of philosophical and psychological knowledge that can enrich the study of values are also discussed.
   Integral approach of K. Wilber is also analyzed. Wilber's model makes it possible to classify the existing approaches to the study of values and to determine more clearly their limitations. It also helps to avoid social and economic reductionism, empiricism, and to study values at the higher level of abstraction and synthesizing. The use of Wilber's methodology can be viewed as a novelty in the area of sociological research as it is mostly unknown among Russian sociologists (in contrast to psychologists).

DE federal media; environmental conflict; "public arena"
AB The paper deals with a presentation of a conflict over a project of paid highway Moscow-St. Petersburg in the Russian federal press. The conflict began as a local environmental clash, but later it became a federal issue to a large extent due to attention of the federal media. A theoretical basement of the paper is the constructionist approach in the sociology of social problems. Mass media greatly define our understanding of social problems. They are 'public arenas' of struggle among different groups over a definition of a certain issue as a problem situation, which requires or does not require a specific solution. The very fact of a depiction and interpretation of an actor of a conflict situation in mass media seriously influences at a success of this actor. On this premise, social movements that want to influence public opinion and political agenda significantly depends on the press. The purpose of the study was to investigate possibilities of different interpretations for disputable situations by opposite sides of the conflicts because of presentations of the situations in the 'public arena' of mass media.
   For our analysis of newspaper articles we employed diagnostic and prognostic frames. The diagnostic frame identifies problems, while the prognostic frame offers solutions of these problems. The analysis uncovered four different approaches towards depiction of a conflict: 1) mainly ignoring of the conflict; 2) a strong support of a debatable project and a negative attitude towards members of protest actions; 3) a concern with the project and a positive attitude towards members of protest actions; and 4) a neutral approach towards a description fo the conflict. The study showed that the environmental movement by dramatizing the situation could draw attention of the federal press towards the problems, which required a solution. At the same time, the analysis found that a political position of a periodical influence a character of its publications to such an extent that even dramatic events fall out of the journalists' field of vision. The case of the highway Moscow-St. Petersburg shows us that the Russia federal press is highly pluralistic discussing sharp social problems.

   state budget; unemployment; UK; Sweden; Ireland; Baltic countries;
   Greece
AB The article analyses the most recent experience of anti-recessionary policies in several EU member nations, such as UK, Nordic countries (especially Sweden), Ireland, Baltic countries and Greece. As for Great Britain, its government implemented traditional package of anti-crisis measures aimed at support of national financial system and stimulation of economic growth. By 2010 the nation reached relative economic stability and then proceeded into a slow recovery. Still, the crisis highlighted serious risks of ongoing financialization and de-industrialization in the UK. So, the government began to develop a long-term program of modernization and structural reshaping of national economy. Nordic countries also actively used Keynesian-type anti-crisis measures. The most interesting is Swedish case. The nation passed the global financial and economic crisis of 2008-2009 smoother than other EU members due to deep institutional reforms undertaken after the acute crisis of 1991-1993. Then Sweden experienced a deep fall of GDP combined with a crisis of local banks, surge of interest rates and unemployment level, weakening of national currency. This pushed Riksbank to introduce strict measures for limiting the inflation rate, Riksdag - caps for state budget expenditure. State sector of national economy was substantially decreased. These measures proved to have long-term positive implications. In contrast, Ireland that enjoyed an impressive economic growth before 2008 was badly prepared to external shocks. The Irish government's reactions to financial and economic turmoil were rather spontaneous. The main task was to stabilize the local financial system that suffered from excessive dependency on foreign markets. Only by 2014 Ireland showed signs of economic recovery. Similarly, Baltic countries found themselves to be ill prepared for functioning under economic crisis conditions. Neither national governments nor EU Commission succeeded to propose efficient anti-crisis actions. As a result, population of Baltic nations most heavily suffered from the crisis. In Greece crisis made inevitable substantial revision of national social and economic model, as well as the political parties' system. Under strong pressures from the EU Greece at last started to implement long-needed reforms in such spheres as budget planning, labor legislation, social insurance, healthcare and education.

Novelty of the work lies in the fact that in these work theories by scientists of divergent angles are formulated and described in borders of concept of spectacularity. This research would be interesting to professionals working in the field of sociology, cultural and philosophy studies.

TI SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN THREE ANOMIE THEORIES

DT Article
DE anomie; institutional anomie theory; social structure
AB The article addresses E. Durkheim's, R. Merton's anomie theories and the institutional anomie theory of S. Messner and R. Rosenfeld. The focus of the article is on how social structure is applied within these anomie theories and how it advances from a secondary topic in Durkheim's work into a key element of Merton's theory. I also address the shortcomings that Messner and Rosenfeld's institutional anomie theory has due to the lack of development of the issue of social inequality. Addressing the relationship of anomie and social structure helps show an alternative prospect to analyze and compare anomie theories as well as enables to reveal broader possibilities of application of social structure to studying anomie in contrast to the widespread empirical practice in anomie studies to restrict the social structure to income, social status, etc. (as Srole 1956, Dean 1961).
   According to Durkheim's approach, the social structure adjusts people's aspirations to a normal level for each social class. In Merton's view, in the situation of overemphasis of goals of success the social structure itself creates the strain for the lower social class representatives to deviate. Messner and Rosenfeld on the contrary claim that all societal layers have the strain to anomie due to the dominance of the economy over other institutions. Social structure has a most important role in Merton's theory. It also demonstrates a serious shortcoming in the institutional anomie theory: if one assumes the dominance of monetary goals at the institutional level, it should lead at least to inequality at the level of the institutes for different population groups: ones will have the opportunity to take care of own children and give them traditional education, others won't. Interesting to note, the issue of the normative regulation, which works, according to Durkheim, via the social structure is not addressed by other theories. Merton analyzes a situation of a normative conflict between the goals and the means, but not anomie (Gofman 2013, pp. 31-32). The problem of social regulation is hardly an issue for Messner and Rosenfeld: regulation should be constituted by institutes. Thus, in the situation that those are dominated by economy, there is a laissez-fair principle reigning in the society. Moreover, the usage of anomie by the authors seems to serve as a means for the institutional theory as a macro-level theory to separate itself from the strain theory, which is in terms of Messner and Rosenfeld a micro-level perspective.

Due to the close relationship between the object of study with the general research field some main ways of studying the phenomenon of migration lists: economic theories, positivist, systems and transnational approaches. Using the experience of translating foreign sources concluded that the terminology and lexical combinations of "educational migration" in the English language are identical. Then the main aspects of the study of educational migration of western scientists are following: the problem of social inequality of migrants in the recipient country (social, political and national aspects), the degree of successful migration, depending on the age and sex of the migrant, the effect of stigma, the impact of the characteristics of the formation of the recipient country for migrants, various levels and adaptation strategies. Also takes into account the socio-cultural barriers between the local population and educational migrants (language, religion) and social networks formed by migrants.

AB The present paper is devoted to the problem of medical care accessibility in relation to Russian society. The World Health Organization considers the provision of universal access to medical care system as an obligatory demand at the contemporary stage of social development. However sociological and statistical data suggest that there are significant social differences in possibilities to get an adequate and timely medical help in Russia. The theoretical purpose of article is to create a universal approach to assess the accessibility of medical care system. The second (practical) point is an empirical sociological diagnosis of the true accessibility level of medical care in modern Russia. The concept of access to medical care is analyzed as dynamic interaction of different variables, the interaction of actors in the medical system in a changing social context. Given this we built a theoretical model of sociological diagnosis of the Russian medical care accessibility. Particular attention is given to the possibility of integrating of economic, organizational. socio-cultural dimensions for better sociological understanding of accessibility factors. Figures show, that pathognomonic factors in access to medical care in Russia are: increasing a private health sector, dysfunction of health institute (ineffective regulations and ineffective financing policy), low level of medical culture of the society. Despite considerable efforts by the health authorities to promote legislative and regulatory innovations, achievements in this field are minor. Organizational and financial barriers produce an alternative medical practice behavior, primarily in, the treatment without help of doctors. The data are presented by sociologists of "Russian Public Opinion Research Center" (OAO "VCIOM"), and other scientists, confirm this fact. In conclusion is argued about impossibility of sustainable transition the Russian health care to self-regulation in the medium term.

AB At present, Mexico makes an ambitious attempt to carry out far-reaching structural reforms. Of key importance is the reform in the energy sector which is the foundation of the national economy. The reform course of the Mexican authorities and the matrix of their political actions deserve scrutiny, since their value transcends national boundaries, reflects problems inherent in many developing countries paving the way in shifting sands of global economic relations. Mexico seeks to seamlessly combine the politics of the energy sector reform with pragmatic interests of transnational corporations willing a broader access to Mexico's oil and gas resources. This is one of international aspects of the energy reform in Mexico. Another one is that using reforms Mexican authorities yearn to strengthen Mexico's geopolitical role, confirm its status of a rising power.

AB Non-profit associations consitute an important part of civil society. Performing the function of self-organization, they are aimed at solving urgent social problems. This article presents the results of the survey research concerning the population's attitude to civil society organizations - the overall awareness and assessment of public organizations, the existing participation level and the future commitment to participate in the activities of these organizations, and the dynamics of these indicators (comparative analysis of the survey results of 2011 and 2014).
   The social base of civil society is analyzed within the framework of he concept offered by the Research Laboratory of Civil Society, HSE. According to the concept, the people are divided in terms of their social activity and form the core, the satellites kernel, the buffer, as well as peripherals and outsiders. Our results demonstrate a tendency of increasing total awareness of the activities of non-governmental organizations with a simultaneous decrease of social activity in most areas. We can see loss of interest in social activities - the trend of reduction in the volume of the nucleus, the satellite and the buffer zone, ie, those segments of the society who have a stable and periodic activity in social activities or principled commitment to that kind of work. At the same time, the share peripherals and outsiders, ie those who are not ready to participate in any social activities and generally possess negative attitude towards civil society organizations is increasing.
   Analysis of the barriers and the catalysts of social activity demonstrated an increase of functional pragmatic attitude with "the lack of spare time" as the main barrier, and the rising importance of personal benefits as the main catalyst.

DE harmony; unity; social ideal; Confucianism; Buddhism; Taoism; equality;
   equity
AB This paper is devoted to the problem of social harmony. Although we believe that from this study comparative conclusions can be easily made. The focus of the study is China, one of the most rapidly developing countries today. Fast economic development of East Asian countries, the appearance of the East Asian model of modernization on its own basis revealed some advantages of eastern culture which is based on the teachings of Confucius. In the 13th century Western thinkers were delighted by the organically holistic worldview of eastern teachings. This paper presents a historical-philosophical analysis of the "harmony" concept as a social ideal in Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and its interpretation in the modern Chinese philosophy. In Buddhism, the question of social harmony is not distinguished as an abstracted system, but implicitly contains original ways to resolve social contradictions through awareness of not-existence of the single "I" and of correlation of all phenomena. According to the tenets of Taoism, harmony is a mechanism by which all things through struggle come to the correlation and unity. From the view of Confucianism, harmony is the highest value and the most important law of life. Harmony appears in concord of all the inhomogeneous, in achieving through this of a new harmonious unity, in the birth of something new in the process of interaction of the opposites. In modern Chinese science, the notions of social harmony, harmonious society are studied, first, in the context of the concept of building a harmonious society proposed in the early 20th century by former President of China Hu Jintao; second, from the view of the so-called Chinesized Marxism. On this basis, the author defines social harmony as a form of resolving social conflicts, achievement of the unity or coherence between the parties to conflict. An essential issue of social harmony is the issue of social equity. The legal aspects of social equity in China are also examined. The institutional features of the modern period in the development of Chinese society hindering the achievement of social justice are considered. The author also makes an attempt to analyze social justice in the political and economic dimension. In conclusion, the important role of the state in the ideological and moral education of the people in order to harmonize social relations is emphasized.

AB Traditional stability of the Swedish legislative and executive authorities functioning, manifested in the almost complete absence of parliamentary and governmental crises, was questioned by results of the general elections in September 2014. The Alliance of four center-right parties who ruled Sweden from 2006 to 2014 suffered a defeat having lost 32 of 173 mandates. Simultaneously, the informal coalition of three center-left parties that opposed to the Alliance in 2006-2014 increased its representation in the Riksdag from 156 to 159 deputies only. Thus, none of the two inter-party blocks has the absolute parliamentary majority (175) needed for the formation of the own government. At the same time, Sweden Democrats who first entered the Riksdag in 2010 have significantly increased their faction (from 20 to 49 deputies) and thereby strengthened their kingmaker position (holding the balance of power) in the new parliament. Yet this party is isolated and excluded from the cross-party interaction in the Riksdag because of its Islamofobia and anti-immigrant attitudes. The new government of minority (the Social Democrats and the Green Party) was approved by the Riksdag due to the negative parliamentarism principle which means that the government shall be deemed approved if it does not receive the absolute majority of votes against it. However, many subsequent government bills submitted to the Riksdag are likely to be rejected by the opposition parties of the Alliance with assistance of the Sweden Democrats. To avoid such situation, the government parties have to bargain with smaller center-right parties on particular issues and thus to form a required ad hoc parliamentary majority. After the last elections, the political establishment parties became much more dependent in their interaction on the Sweden Democrats' unpredictable behavior than before. All of these factors greatly complicate the Riksdag's and the government's work as well as sharply increase risks of governmental and parliamentary crises even to the extent of the government's resignation and pre-term elections. It is unusual for Sweden where such elections last took place in 1958.

However, at the beginning of the 21st century Slovak settlements still retain a strong rural character. As a result of market reforms and westernization a large part of the countryside tremble in the balance, processes of depopulation and formation of excluded social groups take place especially in small municipalities. Further still, in the context of increasing migration from cities to countryside more and more rural patterns of thinking extend to urban environments. The primarily important urban-rural line of societal differentiation, perceptions, attitudes and voters decision-making process are analyzed on base of Slovak sociologists' research. They discovered the phenomenon of historic "embedding" of the party type gaining the voters' support and commitment to one-party system, starting from the Inter-War Period till present. Slovakia represents the case of the weak left-right party profiling and inclination to various "parties of collective identity". Definitive significance of ethnicity and religion as divisions in mass political orientations, traditionally characterized by the emphasis on leftist orientations, social rights and value of nation are shown in the paper. According to results of the latest socioempiric studies in the country, most people in Slovakia (mainly the so called "loosers") did not adopt neoliberal, Western-type path of development, regarding the existing inequalities as too large, and preferring social equality in a society of poor to social differentiation in a society of abundance. Social rights are estimated by the majority of Slovak people higher than political rights now.

DT Article
DE Arctic; globalization; UNCLOS; national interests; political space;
   regionalization; sovereignty
AB In terms of the space concept, the prospects of Russia's new formats of global co-operation development through mutually beneficial transnational partnership in the Arctic are analyzed in the article. The possibility of implementation of Russia's Eurasian and Arctic advantages in the Trans-Arctic as the key element of global connection between Trans-Atlantic and Trans-Pacific spaces is considered. Until now the "Eurasian dividends" for Russia have been associated with strengthening of its positions in the Pacific Asia. However, the scale of Russian socio-economic and naval presence in this area does not allow the country to become a leader. The situation is completely different in the Trans-Arctic, where Russia's total capacity is equal to that of other Arctic states. Moreover, in the Trans-Arctic the "Eurasian factor" may become an "influence multiplier" for Russia. This refers to Russia's key role in the connection between Trans-Atlantic and Trans-Pacific through the logistic chain: Northwest Passage - Northern sea route - Eastern Siberia's river system - Trans-Siberian Railway. The Trans-Arctic may become a "testing ground" for neutralisation of attempts to isolate Russia from global governance, which appeared in G-8 dismantling. The initiation of a new structure with participation of global "extraregional" actors, first of all Russia's strategic BRICS partners, could become its efficient Arctic pivot. Special attention is paid to subjects of the multilevel governance over the Trans-Arctic, to aspects of connection between transnational spaces, to the potential conflictogenity of the Arctic macroregion, and to the problem of the sovereignty concept classical understanding transformation, which appeared in the Arctic context. The relevance of the topic stems from decisions of the RF Security Council special extended meeting (April 2014), which put the "qualitative strengthening" of Russian positions in the Arctic, "preservation of Russian influence" in the region, and "advancing of partners" as major priorities. The tendencies of the Arctic transnationalisation and of the Trans-Arctic formation indicate a serious challenge for the Russian expert community and policy-makers. On one hand, Russia cannot sacrifice its national interests and restrict its rights and powers in the areas, to which its sovereignty and jurisdiction extend. On the other hand, formation of a new global governance regime in the Arctic gives Russia a chance to strengthen its leadership in this polar area, since the socio-economic, political and reputation dividends brought by such regime might be extremely high.

DT Article
DE non-Western societies; middle class; social structure; "dualistic"
   economic growth/development; "non-orthodox capitalism"; North-East Asia;
   India; Indonesia; super large entities/countries
AB The present article focuses on the entity of middle classes in non-Western societies. The social formation of this kind is a relatively new phenomenon. As far as the modern Western societies are concerned, the social and political "materialization" of the above-mentioned entity has covered the period of no less than five centuries. The middle class in modern transitional societies began to emerge quite recently, with a few notable exceptions, after gaining sovereignty. That is one of the reasons why political systems in the non-Western world are mostly fragile and susceptible to instability of different kinds and origins. The so called "Arab awakening" gives a vivid example for the "underdevelopment" of indigenous middle classes. Whilst in the advanced industrial societies middle classes were (and are) the building blocks of social structure, economic and political development, elite recruitment, etc., among the non-Western societies (with the salient exception of the North-East Asia) the process of the middle class institutionalization as well as its economic and political self-assertion is still under way, somewhere at the initial stage of development. Comparing various non-Western societies from the middle class inner dynamics as well as self-assertion perspective, the author concludes that in the ultimate analysis, the maturity of this process is dependent on the pro-active and creative role of the State. The latter serves as the main driving force of the middle class consolidation and the instrument of political and economic systems for increasing and advancing development. The cases of India, on one hand, and Indonesia, on the other, demonstrate convincingly that the State remains the leading institution of the society able to accelerate economic growth and development, but also to stimulate the emergence and socio-political assertion of the middle class in contemporary non-Western world.

DT Article
DE "Another legend"; image type cities; the motive; B. Godunov; False
   Dmitry I; the city of Seversk land
AB The compilatory monument "The other legend", collected in the 20-ies of XVII century identifies several types of images of cities and towns. The first type, which includes places of exile and imprisonment far from Moscow, appears in the description of the acts of Boris Godunov and is characterized by the utmost generalization and symbolism of folklore type. The second type is found in the fragments, acquainting the reader with the biography of Gregory Otrepiev and "Ilzvet (petition)" by the elder Varlaam. Cities are represented there by a single sacred object (monastery or church) and serve as a means of indirect negative characterization of False Dmitry I. The third type has concise lists of criminal towns of Seversk land, which as "city-whores" oppose to Moscow as a "city-virgin". In the text there is a series of echoes from the Book of Revelation by John the Theologian, confirming the possibility of interpretation of the Seversk lands as Russian Babylon at the Time of Troubles. While comparing similar lists in the Russian and foreign sources, we can come to the conclusion, that the compiler of "The other legend" introduces in this way the major theme: the town is first of all its people. It is their cmotions and actions that predetermine the dual perception of the city. From the political point of view, the towns of Seversk lands are the criminals, "whore towns", from the humanistic point of view, they are towns of people who are solving difficult problems. In general, urban theme, which is sparingly presented in "The other legend" from artistic point of view, is included in a single code, interpreting events of Russian history, and plays an important role in the conception of compiler.

DE Podmetnoe pismo dated by 1732; Reshilov's case; Mikhail Avramov; Markell
   Radyshevskiy; Theophan Prokopovich; Anna Ioannovna
AB "Podmetnoe pismo (an anonymous letter) dated by 1732" is an anonymous tract, written at the time of the beginning of Anna Ioanovna rule, criticizing the Holy Sinod church policy and foreigners dominant influence in the supreme power. In order to find the author of this writing the Secret chancellery carried out an investigation during 1732-1738 that was later named "Reshilov's case". The details of the investigation were studied by I. A. Chistovich in the 19th century in the archives, however the genuine text of the anonymous letter was considered to be lost. The copy of the letter was discovered at the present day by St. Petersburg fine art expert S. O. Androsov though the author of the writing remained unknown. The study of the text of "Podmetnoe pismo" and its political program proves that it was written by someone from the social circle of Markell Radyshevsky, the main critic and opponent of Theophan Prokopovich in the beginning of 1730s. In our opinion, the most probable author is an associate of Peter I, the former head of the printing-house of St. Petersburg and a political prisoner during Anna Ioannovna's rule, Mikhail Petrovich Avramov (1681-1752). The comparative analysis showed the undoubted stylistical and substantive similarity between "Podmetnoe pismo" and the so-called "Chelobitnaya (plea) to Elizaveta Petrovna" dated by 1749 and some other Avramov's writings. "Podmetnoe pismo dated by 1732" is to be recognized as an outstanding record of Russian publicism and one of the most interesting sources of the study of ideological struggle of the epoch of Anna Ioannovna rule.

DE guided tours; organization of leisure time; adult education; the 1920s
AB Various aspects of guided tour activity for adults are considered in the article through the example of touristic organizations of Petrograd-Leningrad in 1918-1929. The author states that after the Revolution of 1917, excursion institutions were the first to be created in the structure of state organizations; at the same time, it is difficult to identify clearly the exact functions of some of them, as well as the mechanism of interaction between excursion institutions, engaged in sightseeing activities. The number of citizens involved in the guided tours by those organizations can be described as substantial. They were mostly workers. Developing the thesis of the British researcher Louise McReynolds, who noted that at the turn of the 19th-20th centuries a "conversion of the noble "traveler" into the bourgeois "tourist"" began, the author states that in the 1920s, a bourgeois tourist turned into a "proletarian" excursionist. The routes offered for "proletarian" excursionists included revolutionary sights, the memory of "the old regime", museums, and factories. Recommended objects did not change much during the 1920s. The characteristics of participants of conducted tours encouraged employees of political education to search new forms of excursion work, like excursions for large groups. The organizers of such excursions pursued recreational and educational purposes; however, more of the excursions were entertaining. In the early 1930s, along with the development of "proletarian" tourism, importance of organizations for local excursions decreased.

DE extremism; methodological patterns; social philosophy
AB In the article the problem of definition of extremism and theoretical interpretation of its essence is observed.
   Modern theoretical extremism researches are characterized by a remarkable variety of methodological approaches and concepts. The attempt to classify them just in the group around the problem of radicalization of social and political movements into violent extremism might result in enumeration of several dozens of sociological and other social theories. Whereby, the notion of extremism maintains its conceptual ambiguity and changes its content depending on socio-political and socio-cultural context.
   The article suggests a new solution to the problem with definition of extremism in terms of typology formation of various definitions of extremism built on identifying and description of methodological patterns fundamental and structure-forming methodological ideas which establish some specific schools of sciences and directions in the interpretation of extremism. In addition, the pattern has no connection with the explanation how extremism develops through the time and in different socio-cultural fields that is the prerogative of some certain sociological researches. It approaches to the very essence of phenomenon as it reveals a subtle social and cultural principle of extremism and determines its socio-philosophical aspects.
   According to the approach mentioned above, five main patterns were found and described in modern researches of extremism: "rational extremism", "mainstream vs extreme", "extremism as monism", "extremism as ideation", "extremism as method". It is also noticed that one theory (or definition) is able to combine two or more patterns. The integration of patterns can become a promising direction in the formation of entire theory of extremism.

AB This article analyzes the policies of the BRICS grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa as a whole and individually in Africa. It also explores their political and economic interests in Africa and the various patterns and strategies of each country's cooperation with Africa, and estimates the impact of BRICS aid and investment on the African economy and development. The BRICS members have emerged as the new effective actors in the world arena. Their economic weight and political influence are growing. They are focused not only on strengthening their ties within the association, but also on assistance to Africa as a way for emerging powers to change the existing world order. The BRICS is deepening its engagement with African countries, which have had great successes in development in recent years. BRICS members' attention to Africa is determined by its resource potential and its growing influence in the world economy and contemporary international relations. BRICS countries are large trading partners of Africa, and Africa's trade with BRICS members is growing faster than with its traditional partners. Africa has become the main destination for BRICS development aid and investment. BRICS members focus particularly on African infrastructure. They use soft power widely in developing humanitarian ties with Africa, particularly in health care and education. The BRICS is also an active participant in peacekeeping and conflict resolution in Africa. The five countries increasingly collaborate in Africa rather compete. The BRICS thus contributes much to African economics, and its presence on the continent has become an important and welcome phenomenon.

DT Article
DE Subject script; kinship signs; signs of property; proto-document; origin
   of document; social role of document
AB The article strives to research the origin of document. Until recently it has been addressed on basis of informational approach, which argues that advent of document was a result of social information growth exceeding human memory resources. The author uses socio-political analysis based on interdisciplinary approach to study document and the problem of its origin. Some recently uncovered data from anthropologists and Sumerian specialists point to the origin of document being not informational. It is associated with the nature of social self-organization. Document was a product of the development of social institutes of family and private property and of transition to patrilineal succession. Kinship signs, marks of distinction, authority (totem) and property (stamp, brand, tamga) are regarded as proto-documents regulating family and economic relationships. Document in its essential form appeared with the advent of surplus products of agriculture and cattle-breeding and necessity of its calculation, exchange and sale (contract), regulation of inheritance (bequest, contract) and power (legislation). Document originated in necessity to confirm and prove the commitment of certain actions. Studying the Sumer data the author points out that document recording daily activities from the very beginning was a social instrument and regulator even while knowledge transfer remained oral. And when narrative recording began book and document differed by social functions, manufacturing techniques and storage practices. Consequently, from its very origin document and book represent different phenomena dealing with different social issues.

LA English
DT Article
DE globalization; hybrid regime; clan traditions; corruption;
   modernization; universalism
AB The article discusses the problem of the applicability of modern public administration theories and practices outside liberal democracies. The theory and practice are not universal; they do not apply to the conditions of the most numerous type of state in the world, namely nation-states, with "hybrid" political regimes and a mixed system of economic, social and cultural relations. The type of political and socio-economic development of these states cannot be defined in some fields; it is extremely resolute in being temporary and transitional. This is especially true in societies with clan and patron-client relationships, where these prevail at each level of the civil service hierarchy. By using the examples of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, the author shows that this type of relationship gives rise to corruption, but also performs a number of important functions in the social sphere, and could sometimes be used as capital modernization by the authorities. Russia, described in the article as a country with ruined social mutual aid traditions, demonstrates that clan relationship traditions continuing in a number of Central Asian countries may cause less damage than full social atomization. The paper is aimed at formulating a hypothesis of the feasibility of convergent approach in public administration theory development for further research. The core idea represents the counter convergence of the theories and the real conditions of governance in various nation-states with hybrid regimes. The article is based on the author's own research and the public administration department's student studies, performed under his supervision.

AB The article touches on the contradictions between the market model and the social and welfare models of the state which remain unresolved especially in the educational sphere both in the developed and developing and post-communist countries including Russia. The special object of analysis is the educational aspect of new liberal ideology in the Western Europe as like as the ideology of Republicans in the USA identified as neoconservatives and compassionate conservatives. The new ideological perspectives of evolution of education and some educational projects in the globalization era are also discussed. Globalization of education refers to the worldwide discussions, processes, and institutions affecting local educational practices and policies, first of all, the national school systems. Today, many nations choose to adopt policies from the global superstructures in order to compete in the global economy. There is a constant dynamic of interaction: global ideas about school practices interact with local school systems while, through mutual interaction, both the local and the global are changed.

AB In the article marginality problems in their lighting in the Russian theses of doctor's and candidate level are considered. It is shown that interest to studying of problems of marginalization is defined by existence of deep social and philosophical traditions, the fact of ambiguous impacts of welfare transformations on various social communities and the identity of the certain person. On the basis of the content analysis the range of distributions of dissertation researches on marginality problems from 1991 to 2013 is revealed. In the article the perspective considered in theses in various directions of science and vocational training is differentiated. It is shown that many works performed on philosophy and psychology, have no practical focus. It is established that theses on philosophy, psychology, the perspective is presented to philology mainly on the basis of descriptions of a phenomenon of the marginality, available in philosophical and literary works. The majority of dissertation works is united by idea of recognition of marginalization of the population as consequences of economic, political and sociocultural transformations of society. Some aspects of emergence of signs of marginal culture at the military personnel transferred to the reserve, have been already investigated. In modern researches out of a zone of attention there are problems of marginalization and) migrants and children of labor migrants, b) the homeless who doesn't have constant a residence owing to their involvement into financial swindles, c) jobless various typological groups, d) re-emigrants. Not enough attention is paid to prevention of marginal behavior and socialization of children and teenagers. These subjects are actual and wait for the research in the future on the basis of the actual supervision of a phenomenon of social exclusion. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Indigenous peoples of the North; reindeer herding; traditional nature
   use; landscapes
AB Reindeer herding is not only the sector of agriculture, but a life style of reindeer herders. With reindeer husbandry related a cultural traditions and ancestral activities of indigenous minorities of the North - the Evenks, Evens, Yukaghirs, Dolgan and the Chukchi people living on the territory of Yakutia.
   According to the Government Decree 2009 - the 21 districts in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) relates to the areas of traditional residence and traditional activities, including reindeer herding. As a result of adaptation of indigenous peoples of the North to the features of natural areas of Yakutia with an area of 3.1 million square kilometers, historically several areas of doing reindeer farming. Tundra type of reindeer herding was characterized by a large size of herds, reindeer were used for food and for sewing clothes. hi taiga type of reindeer herding historically reindeers used for transportation, herds were small, there was no long migrations, reindeer herding was combined with hunting and fishing.
   Development of reindeer husbandry requires large areas of land. The state policy of the USSR aimed at improving the lives of Northern peoples included the relocation of the nomadic population to a sedentary lifestyle, the creation of compact settlements, the establishment of large agricultural enterprises (kolkhozes and sovkhozes). This led to the forced migration of herders from remote nomads to the bigger cities.
   As a result, traditional nature use was forced to coexist with other forms of land use. In the 1990s, following the collapse of the state farm and collective-farm system with the advent of laws on indigenous peoples of the North and nomadic tribal community, many peoples return to the nomadic way of life. Currently the Northern tundra, mountain-tundra and mountain-taiga complexes which comprise 90,3% of the total area of Yakutia, live 59.2% of the indigenous peoples of the North from their total population in Yakutia. In this territories also there are 86.5% of all livestock deer Republic and 60,1% of the total number of nomadic communities.
   The southern part of the Republic, where he actively goes through the process of industrial development of the district is characterized by a significant number of nomadic tribal communities with a small area of reindeer pastures (about 10%) with a large value of reindeer capacity. On this territory in 2010 lived 13.0% of the indigenous peoples of the North from their total number in the Republic.
   The study of the processes occurring in the development of reindeer husbandry in some areas of Yakutia shows a strong correlation with socio-economic conditions of the indigenous peoples of the North, their culture and lifestyle from the development of reindeer herding. Resettlement of indigenous peoples of the North in Yakutia is characterized primarily by features of their placement and quality of reindeer pastures.

AB The paper is focused on the Soviet public holidays as political events. After the Revolution of 1917, November, 7th became the main holiday of the Soviet "red calendar". The analysis of the features of that holiday is of great importance, because it may contribute to the understanding of the Soviet politics, as well as it may help in revealing the dynamics of the holiday's development, the logic of the party apparatus in the organization of the holiday, and the methods of the population's involvement into the celebration. The representation of the images of enemies played an important role in the early Soviet holidays: for example, the kulak effigy was burned on the Red Square in Moscow in 1918. The analysis of how the political situation influenced the character of burnings shows that the symbolic form of retaliation against the enemies created a carnival atmosphere. The author compares the events in various cities and emphasizes that in 1918, there was not yet a uniform image of enemies, as the representation of the enemies differed in regions. The author discusses the controversies of the images of enemies. The holiday was used in the struggle of various groups in the Bolshevik party for political influence. The history of the Holiday of November, 7th in general contributes to a better understanding of the power mechanism during the early Soviet period.

AB Overdue reforms in Russia cannot only be defined as "structural" or "economic". It is about the package of changes in all major public spheres, the modernization of all sectors of life. However, among these reforms the key point, on which depends the fate of all transformations and the main political obstacle of economic modernization of the country is the extremely low efficiency of the current system of public administration. That is why numerous programs of socio-economic development of the country, developed over the last 15 years, have never been implemented in practice. The illustration are unsatisfactory situation of the pension system, health care, immigration policy and other areas that affect the quality of human capital - the most important factor of modernization. Public administration reform is a necessary condition for the success of the transformation of all sides of Russian life, including the economy. This reform should be built on the principles of decentralization of power, transferring many of its functions to self-regulating and public organizations, privatization of the economy.

AB In 2015 the Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union entered into force and presented a new stage of reintegration of the countries on the territory of the former USSR. The success of this project will depend not only on collaboration at the national level, but also on the degree of the EEU countries' involvement in the integration process. The academic debate on this issue is a relevant and practically important task. The article highlights the results of the international online-conference "Interregional cooperation in the emerging Eurasian Economic Space", conducted by the Institute of Socio-Economic Development of Territories of RAS June, 16-20 2015. It considers the issues associated with interregional trade and economic cooperation, interaction in the sphere of science and innovation and various aspects of humanitarian cooperation. It raises important problems of cross-border cooperation of the EEU states. The article makes a conclusion about the need to develop the integration process both in scope (through expanded directions of cooperation, which should not be limited only to contacts at the highest political level or trade partnership) and depth (through involvement of regions, enterprises, different social groups, individual citizens).

DT Article
DE Middle East; Arab and Muslim countries; radical Islam; terrorist groups;
   civil wars; Kurds; Iraqi Kurdistan
AB This article explores a general situation in the Middle East as well as the role and value of Kurds in regional geopolitics. The author concludes that in the context of a growing threat of the radical Islamists take-over in a number of the Middle East states, the ISIS strengthening, the incitement of a widespread armed conflict between Sunni and Shia communities, and a tendency towards Syria and Iraq territories turning into the area for an open confrontation between regional centers of power, the Kurds intrinsically become a "Third Force" and play an increasingly important role in stabilizing the military-political situation both in each country of their compact settlements and in the region as a whole. The 40-million strong Kurdish nation, divided by borders of four states, preserves its language, rich spiritual and cultural heritage, manners and customs (and hangs on to its age-old dream to create an independent state). The main attention is paid to the Iraqi Kurdistan as to an advance party of the Kurdish national movement. Today, the Kurdish region of Iraq has all attributes of the state, successfully carries out foreign policy and economic activity. The author notes an important role of Erbil as an intermediary in resolving inter-Arab contradictions in Iraq, for the unity of Kurds in Syria, for a peaceful solution of the Kurdish problem in Turkey. A very important statement is the potential of Iraqi Kurdistan to turn into a national and cultural center of all Kurdish people, and to proclaim an independent state on the North of Iraq, if necessary.

AB The article deals with the role of the UN Security Council in addressing critical issues of regional disarmament: the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons program; the ensuring of the exclusively peaceful character of Iran's nuclear activities; denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It is argued that the enforcement action, coupled with political and diplomatic facilities, could bring about positive results, including the resolution of intricate arms control problems, and help to develop innovative disarmament schemes, if the UN member states were able to combine their efforts and interact firmly and purposefully within the framework of the UN Security Council. Threats to the survival of mankind, such as the spread of mass destruction weapons, terrorism and virulent diseases around the world, as well as various other strategic challenges make it all the more urgent to secure the appropriate collective action of the whole world community under the auspices of the UNO. Taking full advantage of the unique legal authority of the UN Security Council, its mechanisms and instruments to cope with crises of global security squarely meets this task. Suggestions on the strengthening of the UNSC's central coordinating role in managing international security and regulation of armaments in order to make this principal UN body a reliable guarantor of the world community's stability and humanity's progress along the path of arms reduction are substantiated in the paper.

AB Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter have recently become very popular and turned to be an effective instrument for achieving political goals. However, the social networks' impact is rather ambivalent: on the one hand, social media form specific political actors and support self-organization and civil movements; on the other hand, social media reinforce destructive and aggressive manifestations with the pronounced criminal purposes, e.g. social media ability to disseminate information among large groups is used to organize mass riots. The article analyzes one of the recent and significant events largely provoked by the social networks - mass riots in the United Kingdom in August 2011 that were originally a reaction to the murder of M. Diggan by a police officer who tried to arrest him as a suspect in drug trafficking and possession of weapons. The way events developed into mass riots was the result of discussions in social media and use of social networks to coordinate joint actions of mass riots participants. The article provides a detailed description of the events and authorities' actions to overcome the crisis and prevent such riots in the future, thus making some conclusions about the nature of social media impact on the politics.

AB The history of professional associations and unions in Ural cities during the first Russian revolution is analyzed on the basis of archival and published sources (law, record keeping documents, periodicals) along with using the achievements of historiography. The author analyzes the legal framework and the conditions for the occurrence of such associations, particularly in the context of professionalization and politicization of citizens' public life. Using an institutional approach to social (and political) life, the author refers to the least studied issue of how high the level of self-organization of various professional groups (clerks, retail clerks, teachers, health workers, mining technicians, workers, etc.) was in Ural cities during the first Russian revolution. The author concludes that in 1905-1907, professional non-governmental organizations rose from mutual aid societies to trade unions and began to play a significant role in public life of the Ural cities. They defended civil rights and economic interests of their members, promoted the formation of civic consciousness of citizens and increased their professional and political culture.

AB The article considers dynamics of the young workers self-identification indicators (economic, legal, confidence in the future and life satisfaction) on the empirical data of the "Russian Longitudinal Monitoring of the economic situation and health" conducted by the HSE from 1994 to 2012 on the sample of 19,501 young workers aged 16-30. The results of the research show that Russian working youth has been changing self-identification dynamically for the youth is the most active group to integrate into society. Any negative transformation of society generates negative self-identification indicators among the working youth. Any fluctuation in the economic or political life of the country easily undermines positions of the youth, which threatens to destabilize the society as a whole. Thus, in the first years of post-soviet transformations (1994-1996) more than a half of Russian working youth passed through an identity crisis expressed in low self-esteem (due to poverty, injustice, insecurity, dissatisfaction with one's life) and acute negativism and pessimism after the 1998 default. In 1999-2002 the perceptions of themselves and their lives among the working youth changed from negative to neutral, and since 2002 we witness the so-called period of "stability" for only every third young respondent admits low level of self-identification, while a large proportion of the working youth, on the contrary, - consistently high level.

TI John Dewey and the Social State: Towards a History of the Development of
   American Democracy
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE John Dewey; liberalism; social state; welfare state; the USA
AB The article is devoted to analyzing the influence of the American philosopher John Dewey on the process of transformation from classical liberalism to social realism, postulating the interference of the state in the market and in the affairs of individuals. The author describes the reasons behind the need for such a transformation, recounts the origins of the argumentation used by supporters of the new interpretation of liberalism, and analyzes its relationships with the position of the "old liberals."
   The influence of social liberalism philosophy on political systems is two-fold. European states adopted new forms relatively quickly, implementing principles of the welfare state as one of the mechanisms of post-war reconstruction. The USA implemented elements of this ideology even before World War II, within the framework of the "New Deal," but only in a very limited fashion (despite the fact that Dewey himself tried to popularize these ideas in the USA). Despite this limited implementation, the influence of John Dewey and his ideas on American society is deeper than could be expected. He made a utopian idea of absolute equality discernible to large parts of the population in the USA, and subsequently saved the political system from social upheaval. In moments of crisis, Americans take "Dewey's social liberalism pill," but they never finish the full course of this treatment.

AB The article analyses the results of elections to regional assemblies by the proportional system in Russia in 2012-2014 from the point of view of the concept of electoral and political cleavages, which author has developed in his previous works. The author proposes methods for solving problems which appear because of not-coinciding number of contestants in various regions - this generates a different structure of electoral and political cleavages in there. The author also traces how the 'party reform' of 2012-14 has influenced the cleavage structure in Russian regions. He concludes that proponents of the reform reached their aim if they wanted to confuse voters, because the increasing number of contestants multiplied political dimensions and, as a consequence, increased a number of electoral cleavages. Higher level of political competition in some regions was conditioned not by the appearance of new actors but by weakening of the administrative pressure on voters. Author also argues that stricter requirements for contestants in 2014 have led to decreasing number of electoral and, especially, political cleavages, but Russian regions, as before, are divided into two groups: those where authorities continue to control hard the electoral process and those where weakening of this control have brought inter-clan conflicts to the fore.

The author analyzes the main approaches, methods, tools and technologies, as well as the problems of the project. The comparison of the results with the basic features of Digital humanities and Digital Political Science enabled to show the commonality of the major trends in the process of informatization of the Humanities in Russia and abroad. In Digital Humanities, information support of science and education is an important objective of projects. With regard to Digital Political Science, it means creating new opportunities to support research and education at the level of data's organization and visualization. As a result, for the first time in the region, a multidisciplinary source-based information resource, providing the digital representation of a thousand of documents and materials of pre-election campaign in the Kama region, was created.

AB The research is purposed to explore the role and value of the source-oriented information systems for the modern information environment of historical science. It is aimed to characterize source-oriented information systems as a new type of historical source and meta source; study the possibility of applying new methods and technologies, research practice of preservation, organization, visualization and analysis of historical sources; obtain a new historical knowledge on relevant issues of political and social history of Russia.
   The research approved that source-oriented systems are the most effective means of preservation and inclusion to historical and interdisciplinary research of historical sources. The role and importance of source-oriented systems as a base for the effective application and enrichment of historical and interdisciplinary research methods and increment of historical knowledge are confirmed. Information potential of source oriented systems depends on the level of saving primary sources content. Their research capabilities are largely associated with storage and representation formats, level data structuring, models, and embedded research tools. They determine the range of tasks and methods which can be based on source-oriented system and define its efficiency as the investigation tool.

DT Article
DE The Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945; guerrilla movement; organization
   of the resistance; legal basis of guerrilla movement; archival document
AB The article reveals organizational and legal aspects of the resistance to the German fascist occupants in the rear of the enemy during the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945. The author analyzes the domestic political and legal acts, which had decisive importance for organizing the resistance in the occupied regions of the USSR. The case-study shows that regulations and decrees of the Party, government, military and of administrative authorities determined tasks, nature and content of efforts to form and manage the combat activities of volunteer paramilitary forces fighting in the rear of the enemy troops. The author has studied regulations on organization of resistance in the rear of the German fascist troops, such as execution documents of central authorities (decrees of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Council of People's Commissars, State Defense Committee); departmental regulations (directives, instructions of the People's Commissariat of Defense (NKO), People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) of the USSR); orders of the military command of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army; decisions of local Party and Soviet authorities concerning guerilla movement and underground resistance. Materials from the fonds of federal, departmental and regional archives used to prepare this publication allow the author to reveal some characteristic aspects of contradictions arising from the management of guerrilla forces on the level of the central apparatus of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks), the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), and the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, as well as those pertaining to organizational problems in struggle against occupiers on the regional level. The analysis of legal and administrative acts indicates a lack of system in their development and adoption. Command papers ordering to intensify the fight against the invaders were not supported by solution of logistic problems, but came down to demands to increase the number of resistance fighter in the enemy rear. The author argues that accumulation of experience in overcoming challenges in the organization of resistance in the occupied territories had a positive effect on efficiency of formation, staff acquisition and activities of guerrilla forces and underground resistance groups operating in enemy rear in 1942-1943.

AB The article presents the results of historiography and source analysis of issues related to the activities of the Military Council, Staff, directorates, services and departments of the Leningrad Military District (LVO) in planning and preparation of military command and troops in order to repel aggression against the USSR on the eve of the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945; the activities of the Field Operations Directorates for the North and Leningrad fronts, which administered the troops military operations, as well as units of other institutions (People's Commissariats) in 1941. Review of the literature on the subject prompts the researcher to divide it into several basic groups. The first group includes landmark books on the history of the Soviet Armed Forces, and the Leningrad Military District in particular. The second group includes papers dealing with issues of command and control as a part of other issues of the history of the First and Second World Wars, the Civil War and the Great Patriotic War, the interwar period. The third group includes articles in periodicals devoted to the problems of the Armed Forces. Most of them are popular science aiming to introduce a wide range of readers to various aspects of the troops management and the development of the field agencies. The fourth group includes PhD theses on the post-war period. The fifth group includes memoirs of prominent Soviet military commanders: Boris M. Shaposhnikov, Georgy K. Zhukov, Alexander M. Vasilevsky, Matvey V. Zakharov, Sergei M. Shtemenko and others. The sixth group includes the published guideline papers of the State Defense Committee (GKO), the Supreme Command, the People's Commissariat of Defense, as well as documents stored in the central state and departmental archives of the Russian Federation and published collections of documents from other archives. The analysis of historiography on the subject concludes that among the least researched is management process carried out by military authorities of the Leningrad Military District, Northern and Leningrad fronts. Researching activities of the Military Directorate for the Leningrad Military District on the eve of World War II and those of the Field Operations Directorates for the North and the Leningrad fronts in 1941 has necessitated retrieval, processing, analysis and introduction into scientific use of previously unpublished archival documents and materials. Of utmost importance for the study are documents from the Russian State Military Archive (RGVIA), the Central Archive of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation (TsAMO RF), the branch of the Central Archive of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation (the Western Military District, St. Petersburg), the Central State Archive of St. Petersburg (TsGA SPb), the Central State Archive of Historical and Political Documents of St. Petersburg (TsGAIPD SPb). Of all fonds of the Russian State Military Archive (RGVIA) materials of the operational directorate of the General Staff of the Red Army (fond 37977), directorate for the Leningrad Military District (fond 25888), and collection of documents of the Soviet-Finnish war of 1939-1940. (fond 34980) are of greatest importance. Of all fonds of the Central Archive of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation (TsAMO RF) papers in the fond 217 "Documents of the Field Operations Directorate for the Leningrad Front" and such files in this fond as file 60 "Field Operations Directorate for the Leningrad Front. Operations Office of the Staff.
   Field Orders and Decrees of the Staff of the Front" and file 93 "Operations Division of the Staff of the Northern Front. Documents of People's Militia Army" are of particular interest. Introduction into scientific use and processing of the yet unpublished archival materials, as well as review of the recently published military-historical literature benefit the in-depth research of the subject.

AB The paper is devoted to the explication of the inner mechanism of the teleological method in its relation to values as the principle of historical cognition as it is presented in H. Rickert's philosophy. The problem of the principles and methods of historical cognition is extremely important for contemporary philosophy as its crucial points concern not only basic grounds of historical cognition itself but also the very being of Mankind. One can see that nowadays among historians and philosophers there is not common and firm understanding of what the essence of historical cognition is and what methods it must be guided by. There is a variety of conceptions and viewpoints on this problem. It has led to the fact that different types of history has appeared. Now we cannot speak about history, but we have to speak about histories or even historical strategies and practices of historical cognition. However, the situation becomes complicated when we realize that the problem does not only belong to the sphere of pure science but it also deals with our own self-consciousness and self -understanding. It becomes clear when history is used in politics. Here it serves as an instrument of manipulation and a force of forming an ideology. Using history, political and military propaganda gives simple and unequivocal worldview. Thus, propaganda replaces methodological perplexity and philosophical disappointment caused by postmodern intellectual ferment.

DE church historical science; reading; orthodox ecclesiastical seminaries

AB The article is devoted to the role of reading in the life of church historians of the 19th - first quarter of the 20th centuries, the period of the highest development of the church historical science. In concordance with intellectual history, one of the topical research directions, to understand the concepts and approaches of historians it is important to consider the context of the origin of ideas in their works. One of the components of this context is the characteristics of church historians as readers. The sources were autobiographical and official documents, correspondence papers, historical works of Metropolitan Eugenius (Bolkhovitinov), Archbishop Philaret (Gumilevsky), Metropolitan Makariy (Bulgakov), A. V. Gorsky, N. P. Gilyarov- Platonov, E. E. Golubinsky, V. V. Bolotov, M. E. Posnov and others. A significant role in shaping church historians as readers belonged to the years of study - the period of permanent self- education. The prevailing occupation among the students of seminaries and academies was reading historical literature and fiction, including literature in foreign languages. In theological seminaries and academies societies were created to discuss the literature read, for example, a society called " Scientific discussion" in Moscow Theological Academy. A significant proportion of literature was literary, political, historical and theological journals. Among the most popular periodicals were Moskovskiy telegraf (Moscow Telegraph), Vestnik Yevropy (Herald of Europe), Russkaya mysl' (Russian Idea), Otechestvennyye zapiski (Notes of the Fatherland), Strannik (The Pilgrim), Khristianskoye chteniye (Christian Reading), Bogoslovskiy vestnik (Theological Journal) and others. Historians read unique books and manuscripts in foreign missions. Researchers bought books for libraries in Serbian, Bulgarian, Greek. Church historians fulfilled such an important mission as involving the younger generation in reading. Historians teaching in seminaries and academies recommended students to read books, taught to work with the scientific literature, cultivated the culture of reading. Church historians were often wealthy owners of private libraries, they bequeathed books to ecclesiastical and secular schools, monasteries and temples. The writings of church historians reflected all they read in their student years and later. The analysis of bibliographic references indicates historians' superior knowledge of works of their predecessors and contemporaries. Historians did not only know about new books, but also used them in research. Their writings have references to the newest and best monographs, articles in periodicals and scientific journals.

AB For the first time on the basis of recently declassified, formerly secret archival documents from the Russian Federal Archives the article offers comparative analysis of the Soviet-Japanese and Soviet-West German trade and technological relations in the mid 1950-s - mid 1970-s. It was the period when the USSR, first led by Nikita Khrushchev and later by Leonid Brezhnev, was actively searching for strategic partners among the leading capitalist countries. Using the global historical perspective the author weighs up the chances "pro" and "contra" rapprochement and entering into "special relations" with either Tokio or Bonn. The research tends to explain the phenomenon of a rapid growth in bilateral trade even under conditions of the Cold War and absence of the Peace Treaty. It shows the role of such factors as the presence or absence of understanding on the top level of policy making and temporary or permanent solution of territorial disputes in the development of long-term partnership relations. The article draws the conclusion that West Germany's victory over Japan in the competition for strategic partnership with the USSR was predetermined not so much by ideological and military-political considerations as rather by the four key factors: communication networks, credit and financial abilities of Western Germany, technical culture affinity and ability of Willy Brandt's cabinet to make political compromises.

The research goal is to discover the system dimensions and the key factors of the U.S. policy during last years. The research methodology is system and political economy analysis of international relations within neoclassical theory. The main focus of the research is made on the changes in the Afghan domestic policy including fragmentation and marginalization of Taliban and other radical Islamic movements as the further decay of the Pushtun tribal structure, the evolution of inter-ethnic compromise and the results of the "reconstruction of the state" in the context of the NATO's military campaign and the U.S. political goals in Afghanistan and around in 2001-2014.

DT Article
DE inequality; poverty; social policy; social justice; social cohesion;
   social balance
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of trends and political aspects of social inequality. The author argues that the issues of inequality move to the center of sociopolitical relations. The future of modern civilization largely depends on the transition to positive patterns of inequality and social justice that promotes formation of growth potential and social cohesion. But the process is highly controversial: the type of inequality based on material wealth is still a dominant feature. Since the end of the 20th century social policy in Western countries has undergone inadequate changes. The growing impact of global competition enhances the growth of poverty and social inequality which is associated with significant increase in unemployment, disproportionate trends in income growth of social and professional groups, and cuts in social programs. There are signs of restructuring of inequality patterns. Despite some improvements, social inequality and poverty are significant and remain a serious problem throughout the world, including developed countries. This leads to the rise of the proportion of citizens who experience a direct decline in living standard. The threat is that high levels of inequality define considerable distinctions in social opportunities that create a permanent and deep conflict of social interests which can be transferred to the political level. As a result, the European social model which has contributed to significant poverty reduction, promoted social growth and social cohesion is under increasing pressure. As for Russia, it needs a strategic consolidation with high degree of social cohesion on major issues, especially of internal development. The perspective depends on the amplification of factors of cohesion, and therefore, measures designed to tackle extreme inequality and narrow the space of social injustice. This involves transformation of sociopolitical strategy aimed at the alignment of social opportunities, the growth of progressive taxation of super-high revenues, capital and wealth. Russia needs a socially balanced political strategy with the emphasis on the adequate contribution to the process of modernization from social groups which control the most part of national wealth. Achieving social and political consensus in Russia on these issues is essential and can open the door to stable and long-term social cohesion, effectively address the strategic issues of sustainable development and growth of social welfare.

DE contemporary political economy; discrimination of political economy and

AB On May, 13-14 2015 the Second Congress of the CIS's and the Baltic States' International Association for Political Economy was held in Moscow, with its focus on the key issues on a renaissance of the political economy. The article below, by a Coordinator of the Association Prof. Oktaj Mamedov, illustrates sophisticated processes related to political situations in modern Russia. Today's Russia, as it was in the pre-Revolutionary period of a century ago, is, according to a figure of speech used by the classics of Marxism-Leninism, "a collection of contradictions", presented by conflicting trends in terms of politics and economics, opposing ideologies of all shades, interregional rivalry, as well as the painful choice between the resuscitating "imperial ambitions" and constraints on the production "ammunition". In this struggle, a numerous group of political economist has adopted a notorious position - namely, one of the chief social science which has already lost its status of the basic element of ideocratic Soviet society, but it has not yet acquired a function of a recognized form of scientific economic knowledge. The Congress highlighted the importance of the fact that education in the post-Soviet period had rightly turned away from the dogmatically distorted "quasi political economy", but in terms of a real political economy, such denials have resulted in systemic "epistemological costs" for all social sciences in Russia.

   OF THE GOTHA PROGRAMME" BY K. MARX)
SO TERRA ECONOMICUS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE classical political economy; modern economy; state and civil society
AB In spring 1875, a treasure of theoretical thought, a critical review of the draft programme of the United Workers' Party of Germany, "Critique of the Gotha Programme" by Karl Marx, had enriched the political economy science. However, only 16 years after the public became acquainted with the "Critique of the Gotha Programme" : it was published by Engels in 1891 in "Die Neue Zeit" - German socialist theoretical journal of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. The author attracts the readers' attention to those aspects of Marx's work which are relevant in context of processes taking place in modern society.
   The socialist system of higher education has been thoroughly ideological, as, indeed, all the coordinates of Soviet life. It ruined, after all, higher education, as well as the Soviet society. But "the ideological Guinness record" took place: there was no a student of those years that didn't flinch when hearing on Karl Marx's "Critique of the Gotha Program". Though, if Marx's work was read, we have fewer problems today. The author focuses on the issues such as relevance of the methodological potential of the work by K. Marx, relation of freedom of society and freedom of state, military-government despotism, failed prophecy and fate of Marx's "Gothic" ideas in Russia.
   The author introduces categories of "Gothic society" and "Gothic economy" within the conceptual apparatus of modern social theory, referring to the presence of the characteristic features of which Marx had foreseen in the transition from capitalism to socialism.

DE tolerance; think tanks; discrimination; horizontal control; European

   statute for the promotion of tolerance
AB Nowadays tolerance has become one of the basic elements of European integration process and is often represented by politicians as a form of liberal ideology, which is based on the principles of citizens equality and opponent respect. At the same time common understanding of the tolerance in political science has not yet settled, and many attempts to legally formalize the principles of tolerant behavior, making them mandatory, constantly cause many protests. The main conflict on this issue formed in the political expertise sphere and is represented by the set of analytical centers with liberal and conservative orientation. Most of liberal think tanks take a proactive stance, trying to regularize the sphere of EU citizens tolerant interaction through the adoption of new laws prohibiting all forms of possible discrimination. Conservative think tanks, on the contrary, appeal to the classic social values, including family, religion, language, culture. Identification of the "right" approach to the tolerance interpretation became the priority for the development of the whole European integration policy, but at the same time, the constant appeal to society's values leads to the devaluation of these values and the loss of European society compromise culture. In recent years the opposition of conservative and liberal approaches led to the crisis of the European tolerance concept which under the influence of several private positions lost its original content given by UNESCO Tolerance Declaration. Under the influence of real policy, today even more often instead of social cohesion, tolerance begins to symbolize the utopia of the harmonious existence and the illusory nature of the human rights and freedoms categories.

DE Uncertainty; innovative entrepreneurship; fuzzy sets; universal sets
AB The problem of managing the uncertainties when making business decisions is relatively new to science and practice. However, the question of the elaboration of the development strategy of innovation for companies in the context of non-obvious consequences of every decision is important.
   It is known that uncertainties arise in the external, internal and adjacent environment, moreover, installed and timing of their occurrence, and also defined the regional factor. There is open the question about the management of innovation processes in the company with regard to each specific type of uncertainty.
   To solve the above problems has been specially designed approach based on fuzzy set theory. Thus was created the data processing algorithm of the expert survey of entrepreneurs (more than 6,700 units) that are in its manufacturing portfolio of innovative projects. Within the individual uncertainties were determined the following parameters: at what time each uncertainty will manifest itself; what will be the condition of uncertainty (internal, external, or conjugated organizational environment); is it possible to predict the uncertainty or not; what will serve as a stimulus to the emergence of varying uncertainty (the origin).
   So, to predict the emergence of a situation of uncertainty can only generate their natures, market, and system of relationships, technological, regulatory, financial and temporal. In the case of organizational, informational, human nature to predict the uncertainty is impossible.
   The article also presents the ratios at the indicated behavior of the uncertainties in the implementation of the innovation by time, environment, the prognosis and the nature of the existence of uncertainties themselves.

In article the most vital issue for the Russian Federation -a problem of insufficient adequacy of functioning of social institutes is analyzed. Are noted as well difficulties with socialization processes that involves the essential level of corruption and crime, and also is a fertile field for distribution of extremist ideology. The author comes to a conclusion that the most important condition of stability of the state in general is uniformity of social development at the regional level. The more in the level of economic development between various regions, the indicators of migration and shortage of professional shots in the lagging behind country areas are higher than distinctions. The aspiration to averaging of social conditions of accommodation of the population has to be realized at the level of the significant contributions to development of the lagging behind regions.

DT Article
DE engagement of intellectuals; regimes of engagement; cognitive style;
   field theory; pragmatic sociology
AB The article examines the history of the engagement concept, its genesis during the public debates on social and political role of intellectuals in France in the early 20th century and its following conceptualization in critical sociology of intellectuals and in the pragmatist sociology of the regimes of engagement. In public debates, the term "engagement" initially had strong ethical connotations and was used in two senses: as a commitment to a certain ideological or political program and as a bias, subjective and even dishonest publicly made statement. The critical sociology objectifies the concept of engagement as a subversive strategy of the intellectuals occupying dominated positions in the intellectual field in the game over symbolic capital. The pragmatic sociology turns the concept of engagement into its basic metaphor and describes intellectual engagements as plural ways of conciliation of the values of the worlds of art and science with the request of cultural democratization in the 20th century. The paper argues that the distinction of cognitive styles of discourses using the concept of engagement can be significantly helpful in creating a new vision of the relationship between the sphere of symbolic goods, such as art, philosophy and social sciences, and social reality.

AB On the basis of a substantial body of archival documents of the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the little-known publications, the author has restored laborious work of professor of St. Petersburg University Vasiliy Dmitrievich Smirnov who collected, organized and preserved in the central archival repositories sources for the history of the Crimean Khanate. The author has reconstructed the main events in his life and his activities in the Imperial Public Library related to the concentration in this store of the Crimean Tatar documents (article also contains a short list of his main works). Not limited to the literary sources of Turkey and Russia, Vasiliy Dmitrievich repeatedly worked in the libraries of Budapest, Vienna, London, and Paris. In the 1880's, he continued to develop the theme of his doctoral thesis and combined literary studies and work in the archives with archaeological researches in the Crimea. The author has analyzed the process of creating of the largest work on the history of the Crimean Khanate, which remains hitherto an unrivaled. V.D. Smirnov managed to summarize Turkish sources (medieval Ottoman and Crimean "chronicles", most of which have not yet been translated) and historiography. This work continues to constitute a historiographical interest in the present. He widely covered, in the first place, the political history of the Crimean Khanate.

AB The article deals with the development in the Russian-Estonian relations during the crises of 2007 and 2014, taking into consideration the balance between political and economic factors in the decision-making of the Estonian government. A number of special aspects, trends and problems in trade and investment ties are detected.
   The aim of the study is to uncover the key motivation behind the actions of both Russia and Estonia, to identify the drivers for economic and political development in the region, and to work out recommendations to adjust them. The questions put forward by the authors of this article could not be more topical at the time, when Russia's economic situation is obviously getting worse and capital flight (to the neighboring EU Member States) is likely to increase.
   The method of the study is a comparative analysis of the impact on economic ties made by the Russian-Estonian crisis of 2007 and the current international tension around Ukraine. The regional fossil fuel market and the possibilities of Gazprom involvement in its development are also analyzed.
   It is concluded that political motives are still important for Estonia's decision-making, though they are balanced out by measures of business support (despite some of these measures being taken by the EU bodies). The role of political factor for the Russian side is increasing. It is acknowledged that there is a growing number of missed economic opportunities in the Russian Northwest.

AB This paper is devoted to the culture of diplomatic relations between Russia and the Danubian principalities. The article contains a detailed analysis of the projects for the emancipation of Moldavia and Wallachia by the Turkish authorities with the help of Russia. A detailed analysis of the negotiations on both sides on the basis of sources, including archives, is given. Particular attention is paid to Lithuanian project of electing Russian prince, the son of Alexey Mikhailovich, the King of Rzeczpospolita, that would strengthen Russia's influence in the entire region and would contribute to a more effective resistance against Ottoman a.. ession. The Moldovan Embassy in Moscow headed by the abbot Fedor is analyzed. The talks in Moscow in 1674 were of great importance for Russia's foreign policy. The paper covers the situation of Moldova and Wallachia immigrants in the Rzeczpospolita. The success of Russian army in the campaign of 1674 beyond Dnieper, after which the Right Bank population again obeyed the Tsar, made the establishment of Russian-Moldovan border a real possibility. However, as the result of Turkish military victories in 1674 this plan wasn't realized. Nevertheless, according to the politicians of the Principalities, there was a historical perspective of a successful war of Russia against Turkey, which could make it possible for Wallachia, Moldavia, Serbia and Ukraine to become the part of Russia. It would save the people of these countries from the power or influence of the Muslim Ottomans

AB Author analyzes the causes and consequences of the Great Patriotic War. By describing Stalin and Hitler as historical actors in the field of "Realpolitik", the author reveals the similarities and differences between their ideologies, social roots, political and military objectives of totalitarian regimes personified by them. Democratization of the world order became the main outcome defeat of fascism. In Russia, this process from Khrushchev's Thaw until post-Soviet reforms including all its flaws and regressions resulted in failure of totalitarianism; in Europe - in the fall of fascist, authoritarian regimes and establishment of social statehood; in "The Third World" - in the collapse of colonialism. The continuity between Nazi expansionism and Ostpolitik of the West during and after the "Cold War" is shown in the article. Analyzed are the problems of correlation between war and politics, different ways and forms of their interactions. In this regard studied are the coup d'etat in Ukraine committed with the Western contribution, as well as anti-Russian policy of propaganda, diplomatic and sanctions "wars". While dealing with the following international crisis, Russia is forced again to protect its right for sovereignty and the role of an independent actor of the world politics.

   personal life's idea; the relationship of personality and culture;

AB The American sociologist J. Hecker's sociological monograph "Russian sociology. Contribution to the history of sociological thought and theory" is analyzed in the article. The specifics of of consideration of Russian sociology's schools and directions in J. Hecker's monograph is analyzed and the advantages and disadvantages of the American sociologist views are shown. The scientific goal of his work is to introduce to the Western reader the analysis of Russian sociology's different schools and directions in historical context. For the first time in the history of sociology, will be published J. Hecker's work translated by the author from English. American sociologist conducted a detailed, comprehensive analysis of the Russian sociology's concepts and directions in the historical period under review. However, this analysis lacks author's opinion, criticism or expression of consent to different methodological positions and approaches of Russian sociologists. The book presents many direct quotations from the works of Russian sociologists without a specific analysis and evaluation by the American sociologist. However, one of the advantages of J. Hecker's work is that it introduces Western sociologists and the international community the works and primary sources of Russian sociologists. Conscientiously studying the contents of the various movements, and in particular detail the subjective school, American scientist came to the conclusion that in due of the fact that the connection of sociological theories of the political events and social life are extremely close, sociology as a science in Russia is not so much created by professionals type of theoretical knowledge but rather an expression of the positions of leaders of public opinion.
   The main disadvantage of most sociological works in Russia, J. Hecker considers the narrowness of their problems (lack of a systemic approach), because of which they largely lose their scientific value. In this context, we do not agree with his conclusion, and in support of this can be mentioned the integral theory developed on the basis of a three-person model for the formation of leadership qualities of managers, that prove the urgency and heuristic value of ideas of Russian sociologists of the late XIX beginning XX centuries.

DE historical process; family; clan; tribe; ethnicity; nationality; nation;
   state; primordialism; constructivism; social technology; life force
AB The purpose of this paper is theoretical analysis of causes and conditions of genesis of historical ethnic communities as important subjects in the historical process.
   The topicality of this work is determined by the fact that ethnic processes play an essential role in the life of modern mankind, so you need to understand these processes with a view to reduce its negative effects as much as possible.
   The author makes the following conclusions: 1) whereas formation of ethnic groups in the past mainly depended on the material conditions of social groups, nowadays it is defined by social and political factors; 2) in many regions of the modern world various socio-political reasons lead to formation of nations and nationalities, the higher mode of ethnicity; 3) subjective factor plays an important role in the ethnic movements; 4) in this regard, it is shown that constructivist approach in understanding the essence of ethnic phenomena becomes increasingly popular in the scientific literature.
   One of the substantial characteristics of a nation is existence of a state. After acquiring the public formalisation, nationality receives relative independence as a political subject within a common federal state and becomes a nation. An ethnicity at the same time recedes into the background and stores mainly in language and culture.
   Practice of formation of multinational states and their disintegration in the XXth century raises some theoretical questions about the role of ethnic processes in the world history. On the one hand, the presence of several ethnic groups within the boundaries of a state is a factor that weakens its integrity and strength on to withstand the "historical powers". On the other hand, watching the nature itself shows that their diversity is an important factor in the stability and integrity of living systems. Variety and diversity are essential and internal sources of maintenance of stability of a system and at the same time it is a possibility of its development.

AB Ethnopolitical processes in Moldova have provided for actualization of local ethnoses' national identities. Ethnoses, which have formed own territorial community, have got a chance to become valid political actors on the nationwide level. Such status allows ethnoses to consider own future in context of geopolitical perspectives, produce own unique interpretations of space, where they are placed, or modify them depending on external conditions. This paper investigates Moldova's Bulgarians' spatial identity and ethnonational self-identification on the example Bulgarian territorial community, which is in a position of choice one of spatial interpretations.

AB The article discusses current problems of the rural youth migration to the cities in the context of socio-residential assimilation, suggesting a convergence of lifestyles of different large and small social groups living in different types of settlements. The author analyzes the significance of social environments for the formation of political culture of young villagers and the development of their values in the sphere of self-identification.
   The article suggests that successful strategic socio-economic development (prosperity) of large cities, especially megacities, should be closely connected with their responsibility for the adequate development of small towns and rural settlements in order to reproduce and save labor potential of agricultural production in the region and ensure decent life for all actors in this production.
   The authors' reflections and conclusions are based on the results of comparative sociological surveys of the urban and rural youth, carried out in various cities and rural settlements of some RF subjects within the Ural Federal District in 2008-2014.

TI Photography: gravitation of the demos
SO FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE photography; image; idea; representation; demos; non-philosophy;
   Spinoza; Deleuze; Laruelle
AB The article draws on Francois Laruelle's conception of non-photography elaborated in his book of the same name. His basic assumption may be developed in the following manner. Any semiotic or aesthetic reading of representation as something endowed with hidden transcendental -meaning proves dramatically insufficient. Instead, photography should be treated as a new "science" that gravitates towards community understood in an almost physical sense. Community is the expression of the forces of life or a synonym of togetherness that "precedes" any type of representation whatsoever. It is the task of the critical thinker (to remember Walter Benjamin) to reveal the traces of this presymbolic "presence" in symbolic forms that do everything to repress, distort or neutralize it. Despite its unique certifying power photography is no exception in this respect. Yet redefined as a science of forces, a new theory of photography will be closer to physics than to aesthetic theory in the classical sense.
   Reviewing various theories of photography the paper shows that photography has no essence of its own. Instead, it allows one to decipher the imprint of bodies and their interactions, which is very close to the Spinozian notion of (clear and distinct) Ideas. Be it from the viewpoint of epistemology or that of political philosophy, photography invariably displays its ability to certify. Only from now on it is not "reality" that it references but the physics of bodies, which, again in the spirit of Spinoza, proves to be the measure of politics itself.

AB This paper presents the results of research into the social practices of using memorials dedicated to the Second World War in post-soviet Russia. The authors introduce a comparative analysis of two case studies. They examine Poklonnaya Gora,(1) located in Moscow, which is a site of memory (lieux de memoir), according to Pierre Nora, where there was no real fighting during the Battle of Moscow in 1941-1942. This is contrasted with Mamayev Kurgan, located in Volgograd, which is a site of remembrance (lieux de souvenir), according to Aleida Assman, where violent fighting took place during the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942-1943. The authors describe in detail the spatial infrastructure of both memorials and make a classification of the practices in relation to their use, including commemorative, political, leisure, religious, and infrastructure-related social practices exercised by different groups of social agents. The authors conclude that Poklonnaya Gora is a universal memorial relaying a monological heroic discourse, whereas Mamayev Kurgan reproduces the same triumphant discourse, yet twisted through the local context of interaction between the local authorities and the city's communities.

DT Article
DE Russia; archaization; Tuva; social transformations; Ch. Lamazhaa;
   clannishness; historical memory
AB The author of the review analyzes a new book by a political sociologist Chimiza Lamazhaa "Archaization society. Tuvan phenomenon" (St. Petersburg, 2013), which reveals the place and role of archaisms in the process of social transformations. Specific effects of archaization are described in detail with the Republic of Tuva as an example; its past and present history are also discussed. This book convincingly shows that connection between the past, present, and future is a significant and even universal philosophical and general political problem actively discussed throughout the history of philosophy. Applied to Tuvan society, this actualization turns out to be exceptionally actual and is especially enhanced during periods of transformational changes. Ch. Lamazaa credibly demonstrates that the increased interest in historical memory is one of the essential characteristics of a modern society. Not long ago, the modernization process was assumed by many researchers as a rejection of the heritage of the past. Now a belief is growing that it is impossible to understand our present and future without our past.

TI SYMBOLIC PARTY AS CULTURAL AND POLITICAL PHENOMENON: GERMAN EXPERIENCE
   IN RUSSIAN PERSPECTIVE
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE symbolic parties; fragmented political culture; sociomoral environments;
   political subcultures; cold civil war; civil war of symbols; symbolic
   national consensus; dialectic democracy
AB The article is devoted to symbolic parties as a typical phenomenon of segmented (fragmented) political cultures. On a material of German political history, the various aspects of this phenomenon are examined by the author, drawing parallels with post-Soviet Russia. Symbolic parties are understood as coalitions around significant political symbols expressing different segments (fragments) of political culture. Following German sociologist M.R. Lepsius, the author describes the social basis of symbolic parties as a "sociomoral environment". It is a complex socio-cultural formation which differs from the other environments (subcultures) through the symbols expressing specific moral frames of political ideologies. In the context of a segmented and fragmented political culture, the sociomoral environments are characterized by "camp mentality" and a tendency to "social secession." In times of deep sociopolitical crisis, the symbolic parties become an expression of civil war of political symbols rather than a sign of politically diffuse socio-cultural environments. The article indicates the typical characteristics of this war, namely, "savagery" of public political discourse, beastialization of political opponents, social militarism, deficit of monopoly on the legitimate use of symbolic violence, and others. The author considers the sociomoral environments as a subcultural basis of symbolic parties in Imperial Germany; moreover, a comparative classification of symbolic parties in the Weimar Republic and contemporary Russia is proposed in the article. In particular, in Weimar Germany the following symbolic parties are defined: democrats-republicans, imperialists-monarchists, communists-internationalists, and national socialists. In modern Russia, at least three major symbolic parties are identifiable: democrat-westerner, imperial nationalists, and communists-nationalists. Between Weimar Germany and contemporary Russia a substantial similarity is revealed, and this concerns not only a set of symbolic parties, but also the tendency of their interaction: the transition of ideological power from the symbolic party of "democrats" to the one of "imperialists", though in the framework of the same constitutional order. However, in contrast to the ideological situation in Weimar Germany, in the post-Soviet Russia a limited civil-patriotic consensus was formed. Strengthening this consensus involves managing risks of authoritarian-totalitarian unification of the national political culture. Alternatively, this article refers to the experience of "symbolic balancing" of the ideological extremes of "left" and right "in democratic countries. Moreover, the author discusses the E.Fraenkel's idea of "collective" or "dialectic" democracy which involves competent parliamentarism and interaction of political subcultures on pluralistic basis.

TI Execution of local budgets in 2014: tension is not decreasing
SO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST
LA English
DT Article
DE region; territorial budget; deficit; loans; public debt; adjustment of
   budgetary policy
AB Vladimir Putin's "May decrees" have received the status of a national goal. On the background of decreasing economic performance exacerbated by external shocks, the implementation of these decrees has become a heavy burden for regional budgets without an adequate financial support from the federal budget. As a result, almost every Russian region has suffered losses by the end of 2014.
   The fallacy of the ongoing course of budget policy has long been criticized by many leading scholars and experts; moreover, they proposed positive recommendations on the development of alternative policies. Unfortunately, the results of 2014 prove that the RF Government has not abandoned the policy of budget consolidation. On the contrary, gratuitous financial assistance to the regions is actively transformed into debt financing in the form of budget loans. However, the regional authorities can rely on this quasi-support, which is a temporary factor, only provided that the budget is deficit-free and at the expense of abandonment of spending on economic development and on the improvement of welfare of the population.
   The results of the analysis of the facts indicate that the budget-related problems of the regions, arising largely from the inefficient federal budget policy, have reached the critical level. One fourth of the subjects that had a predominant share of market debt turned out to be in a pre-default state. The breakdown of public finances has affected the most prosperous regions, which is contrary to the paradigm of sustainable regional development.
   The regions entered the crisis of 2014 with huge debt and budget deficit; the situation was not so grave during the financial and economic crisis of 2009. In terms of the upcoming 10% cut of federal budget expenditures [5], the subjects of the Russian Federation can hardly expect an increase in financial support. They will obviously have to adapt their budgets to the changing economic situation. But in such conditions, when there are no opportunities to reduce investments, spending on housing and utilities and on the economy, the compensational sources can be found only in the budget sector and the existing measures of social support; such a situation will cause the reduction of domestic demand, creating not only economic but also political risks for the regional authorities.
   The article analyses the execution of budgets of the RF subjects for 2014, substantiates practical recommendations for the stabilization of territorial budgetary systems and proposes measures to lead them out of the crisis.
   The study is based on the official data of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation [7], the Federal Treasury [8], the Federal Tax Service [9], and the Federal State Statistics Service [10].

This micro-historical study describes in detail legal and illegal methods of election campaign and election practices, demonstrates a change in the citizens' social activity and their attitude to the election to self-government organs. The author shows the formation of groups with different political views and public interests and their increasing mobilization and confrontation during the elections.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE constructivism; realism; activity; cognition; upgrade; web; ontology

AB The article discusses the dispute between constructivists and realists, which is claimed to be Losing its relevance. The author tries to show that the presuppositions of the dispute relate to the ancient culture, where the ideal objects first appeared and where the question of their relation to the real world was first raised. In the history of philosophy these relations were comprehended differently, and as a result two opposing views were developed - realism and constructivism. The author argues that in order to get away from the ineffectiveness of the opposition between these views one needs to turn to the methodological analysis of the real cognitive activity.
   In the process of discussing how this turn could be possible the author introduces the notions of ideal object, objectification, diagram, the reality of object ontology,the cycle of the development a new phenomenon along with two kinds of phenomena - the natural phenomena (in the sense of the first nature) and the social phenomena.
   In the final part of the article the author offers a conceptualization of the Internet as a hand-made and mental creation of man, on the one hand, and as a natural phenomenon on the other. It is argued that the Internet exists not only as a newly created "socio-technical body" of man. In the situation of the present crisis it also allows us to maintain and reproduce the social and political Life. As a result, it is claimed that the reality of the Internet could be considered both constructive and existential.
   The author concludes that if we understand the processes of construction and of natural existence not merely as two oppositions associated with one phenomenon, but as two complementary aspects of real human activities, the dispute between constructivists and realists becomes meaningless in the cognitive as well as in the practical perspective.

TI THE GOLDEN HORDE BETWEEN GOVERNANCE AND RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE: REFLECTIONS

SO ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW
LA Russian
DT Review
DE Ulus of Jochi; Golden Horde; Uzbek; Islam; 13th-14th centuries
AB This article contains a review of two monographs by A.G. Yurchenko. In both monographs Yurchenko explores religious situation in the ulus of Jochi in the 13th-15thcenturies. The author of duologue analyzes the structure of everyday life in the Horde State during the 13th-14th centuries, reflecting the ratio of its religious and administrative bases. Yurchenko comes to a conclusion about the existence of a more complex structure of the Horde society in terms of the confessional and political structure of the ulus of Jochi. According to the arguments presented by Yurchenko, one can conclude that the complex social structure preserved even after the Uzbek's adoption of Islam. At the same time, the imperial "vertical of power" based on nomadic tradition and corresponding rituals changed slowly and reluctantly. However, at the highest administrative level, among the Horde elite, belonging to the Muslim faith became mandatory, and only this affiliation allowed to occupy senior posts in the State. This status of religious doctrine within the political system can justifiably be called a State ideology or religion of the State. At the same time, aspects highlighted by Yurchenko (a model of nomadic State, where religious institutions are separated from the State, and sacral-religious, philosophical discourses of sources on the history of the Horde) deserves attention and further development. To understand the current of social processes within the ulus of Jochi during the 13th-15th centuries, to get closer to scientific knowledge of the real history of the Horde, one should critically deal with the sources and consider the Horde's reality through the prism of ideologicoreligious and philosophical doctrines of the time, especially, in the Middle Ages. This article provides additional arguments both in favor of conceptual constructions of the author and in their rebuttal as well. Author of the review finds it necessary to carefully and critically deal with information of medieval sources on the history of the Horde, taking into account conclusions proposed by Yurchenko.

DE property rights; kulaks; Soviet legislation; force regulation
AB Based on the analysis of the Soviet legislation and the set of administrative acts of 1920s-1930s, the authors discuss in the legal field the concept of "kulaks" and the mechanism of their dispossession ("raskulachivanie") as a specific illegal method of confiscatory redistribution of property in transition economy of the mobilization type. The authors conclude that the notion of "kulaks", being widely applied in repressive practices, was not legally established and defined, and pseudo-legal measures of "raskulachivanie", solving solely political tasks, were contrary to the economic efficiency of agricultural production. In this case, the law did not regulate the prevailing social relations, but tried to shape them within the framework of the class doctrine of socialism that had far-reaching consequences: rehabilitation of former "kulaks" was significantly hampered; the precedent of force regulation of property relations beyond the current legislation was created; and, that is especially important in the modern complicated complex geopolitical situation, the negative historical background was formed which considerably deteriorates the perception of the Russian legal realities by investors.

AB The new book by Yu.S. Pivovarov (Pivovarov Yu.S. Russkoe nastoyashchee i sovetskoe proshloe [Russian Present and Soviet Past]. Moscow - St. Petersburg: Center for Humanitarian Initiatives, University Book. 2014. 336 p. ISBN: 978-5-98712-202-0) is in many ways distinctive from the mainstream literature on historiosophy and political science. Presented in the book is a fresh interpretation of the key processes and events of the Russian history. According to the author, the country experienced an anthropological disaster in the XX century, as several revolutionary currents collided in 1917: Europeanized part of the society renounced the traditional authority, the peasantry committed capture and redistribution of land, while the Bolshevik Revolution, taking advantage of the moment, terminated both. In the context of Russian history, the Bolshevik movement is labeled by Yu.S. Pivovarov as a variety of the "Russian Power" system, where power is fused with property - a term "vlastesobstvennost'" ("powerproperty") is introduced in this regard - as well as a variety of a generalized model of power and society structure, going back to the times of Ivan the Terrible ("oprichnina - zemshchina"). Analyzed are the stages of formation and decomposition of this regime. According to the author, the 1980-s/1990-s democratic revolution was unable to overcome Sovietism and Stalinism embedded in the socio-psychological condition of the society. It revitalized the cultural-historic phenomenon of the "red Black Hundreds" as a response to the process of modernization and the social reserve of the antidemocratic authority. Turning to the prospects for change of the current situation, the author concludes that either Russia will be a free and responsible country, or it will not exist at all.

TI Plato and the Corpus Platonicum: the elements of a new model
SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Plato; Corpus Platonicum; H. Tesleff; I. During; speeches; reported
   dialogues; dialogues in a direct dramatic form; chronology;
   institutional approach
AB The approach which dominates today in the field of platonic scholarschip is evidently eclectic. Within this approach, the image of Plato as created by the ancient doxography (a Socrates' disciple who became the head of the Academy) is supplied with discernible features of a modern scholar or university professor. The initial impetus for our model, conceived as an alternative to this eclecticism, was given by H. Thesleff and I. Diking. It can be summarized as follows. An aristocrat by birth, Plato was first and foremost, a political thinker and a follower of the Pythagoreans. His literary activity begins with speeches in aristocratic clubs (late 390s - mid-380s: the Apology, the speech of the Menexenus, the speeches of the Phaedrus and the Symposium, cf. the speeches of the Protagoras).
   The reported dialogues were written against the background and for the sake of regular discussions in Plato's private house, a near Academy, bought upon return from the first voyage to southern Italy and Sicily. These are (late 380s - early 360s): the Republic and, at the same time, the Protagoras, the Symposium, the Phaedo, the Charmides, the Lysis, the Euthydemus.
   The development of Plato's school makes him more concerned with a scientific (verifiable) method of definition (dialectics); in order to elaborate his own method he studies closely the achievements both of the sophists and the eristics (particularly the Megareans). This is when he began to write dialogues in direct dramatic form (late 370s - the second half of the 360s: the Theaetetus, the Cratylus, the Meno, the Parmenides); his students also start writing dialogues. At the same time (mid late 360s) Plato develops the ideas of the last books of the Republic and writes the Timaeus (the demiurge creates the sensible world in accordance with an eternal intelligible model). Then he begins to prepare material for the Laws (cf. the dialogues of Plato's students: the Alcibiades I, the Crito, the Minos, the Euthyphro).
   At 366 Aristotle joins Plato's Academy and becomes an active participant of all the methodological discussions; he writes the Topics and the Sophistical Refutations, and also examines the rhetorical techniques and begins to develop separate sciences: logics, physics (including biology), ethics and politics. As well as other members of the Academy, Aristotle criticizes Plato's conceptions, in particular, his dialectic. Trying to save the dialectic, Plato invents the method of division (the Sophist, the Statesman) and creates a conception of the number as the intermediate between the unity of the first principle and the plurality of the visible world (the Philebus). But these attempts to work out his own scientific method fail. Plato's last work, the Laws, is devoid of any dialectics, nor the conception of the intelligible world. as paradigm to the sensible world is present in this text. Instead, he speaks of an evil world-soul and sharply criticizes natural philosophy.

AB Evolution of Russian political system on its current stage is characterized by search for a model capable of preserving and maintaining stability of its institutions, as well as achieving higher levels of political competition. This problem could be solved by forming a bipartisan model under which, from the one side, the winning party gains the full authority for implementation of its policy; from the other side, strong opposition serves as a factor containing authoritarian tendencies. In the author's opinion, despite the stereotypes, bipartisan system can be formed in Russia. The author analyzes key challenges of Russian political system, advantages of a bipartisan system, Western experience of bipartisanship.

DT Article
DE legitimacy; crisis; trends; political regimes; the Baltic States;
   Latvia; Lithuania; Estonia; political institutions; political elites
AB This article considers the legitimacy of political regimes in the Baltic States by analysing three major parameters: confidence in political institutions, level of corruption, and the development of their party systems. The author identifies the major crisis trends in the legitimacy of the political regimes of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. The article stresses the problem of legitimacy reproduction resulting from the limited representation of the national party systems. Special attention is paid to compensatory mechanisms used by political elites to 'artificially' reproduce legitimacy. It makes sense to analyse the deficit of legitimacy in the Baltic States not only in the context of threats to democratic institutions but also considering weaknesses of public institutions and insufficient resources to ensure stateness. This requires developing a hypothesis about smaller states 'importing' legitimacy from larger states and intergovernmental organisations, in whose zone of influence they are included. In other words, the EU and NATO can provide smaller states not only with economic and military resources but also legitimation 'resources' using their prestige to support the belief of local residents that there is no alternative to the current political system of social organisation. Legitimacy deficit increases the risks of a rift between political elites in the Baltic States, which can become a prologue to a deep political crisis. In these conditions, compensatory mechanisms cannot be considered as targeted exclusively at broad social strata. They are also aimed at political elites, whose consolidation or 'encapsulation' is achieved by exaggerating external threats and resorting to repressive measures in an attempt to develop an ethnonational consensus. These methods are used to ensure self-preservation of the Baltic States political regimes within the current ideological and institutional configuration.

For the first time authors have formulated the notion of crisis of university lecturers' corporate identity influenced by shaping of the Soviet state based on regional example. Factors of formation. and manifestation of scientific and educational community corporate identity have been discerned and analyzed. Special attention was paid to role of state and party organizations in the process of transformation of university community in 1920-1930s, staff and social rotation of scientific and educational community. Despite radical political and socioeconomic changes, that the country had undergone in 1920-1930s the community of higher education lecturers remained a specific social stratum with unique and distinctive characteristics. The article is meant for all interested in Russian history, history and anthropology of higher education and science, and also in Soviet period of Russian history in general.

The article is paid attention to the activities of the social-revolutionaries, peasants' union and representatives of other political parties. The author comes to the conclusion that the Manifest of 17 October 1905 became the starting point of a fundamentally new hard revolutionary violence, which peaked in the winter of 1905-1906 years. The armed uprisings took place in two of the three districts of the Black Sea province (Novorossiysk and Sochi districts) and only a strong anti-Republican stance of the administration of Tuapse district has managed to keep the situation in a legal way.

The author considers the reasons for duration of this process, analyzes the factors that impeded or facilitated the convergence of certain ethnic groups, the level of socio-economic relations, political developments in these regions. The article shows the importance of the Siberian Khanate as a state and ideological unification of the Turkic-speaking population of Western Siberia, as the main unifying factor in the formation of this ethnic group. The author emphasizes the role of the Russian administration, its action for the creation of new Siberian administrative-territorial system, for the spread of Orthodox Christianity, etc. Particular attention is paid to the process of Islamization of the population already living in the framework of the Russian State after the arrival of Russians, to role in this process of the patrimonial Tatar nobility.
   As a result, we can construct the situation as follows. Influenced primarily by political (but not economic) developments, the Turkic-speaking population of Western Siberia was sufficient organized to the last third of the 16th century that is ready to the further rapprochement and transformation into single ethnic group. The weakness of social and economic relations did not allow to develop this convergence. Process of consolidation already began to develop in other conditions after annexation of Western Siberia by the Russian State - in the 17th-19th centuries. The Tatar nobility and Muslim population migrated from Central Asia and the Lower Volga region, played a key role in this process and Islamization of the entire Turkic-speaking population became a crucial factor. This article only underlines major factors of this process. The whole complex of historical, ethnographic, archaeological, and genetic research is needed to fully explore the history of the formation of the Siberian Tatars and defining its basic chronological stages and driving forces.

DT Article
DE Russian Federation; power; state; society; foreign policy; domestic
   policy; public institutions; sociopolitical relations; consolidation
AB On the basis of a representative sociological survey the problem of relations between powers and society in contemporary Russia is analyzed. It is shown that aggravated international relations around 2014 "Ukrainian crisis" became a most important factor for consolidating powers and society. Special attention is paid to the analysis of Russians' attitude to the latest political events, to major public institutions and activities of the President V. Putin. Two events became true symbols of 2014: reunification of Crimea with Russia and Sochi XXII Olympic Winter Games. Different in their contents, both events became associated in the public mind with the beginning of Russia's resurgence as a world power. It is shown also that attitude of Russians to powers is a complex and contradictory set of individual components which do not form an interconnected and sufficiently broad social and political space. The social strata and groups with a positive or a negative attitude to the state power and authorities are very separated because of deep economic, territorial, social, cultural, generational and other differences. A deep socio-economic inequality in society is clearly manifested in attitudes of Russians to state powers. Absence of horizontal civil cohesion and uncertainty regarding foreign and domestic situation cause consolidation of Russian society around its political leader Vladimir Putin. Positive attitude to the president ensures stability of the existing socio-political regime, which, however, in the long term perspective does not preclude emergence of social and political conflicts that in the absence of broader civil consolidation can have irreversible consequences. In general, a set of indicators characterizing relationship between society and authorities demonstrate Russians' support for external and internal policies of the state powers, although this support is not monolithic.

DE biotechnologies; science and technology; Taiwan
AB Development of biotechnologies became one of the priority directions of government science and technology (S&T) policy in Taiwan more than 30 years ago - as early as in 1982 biotechnologies were specified in the second National S&T Development Program as one of the eight major S&T spheres. However, until the second half of the 1990s the industry saw weak development policy. Achievement of the relatively high level of economic development and accumulation of science and technology experience in Taiwan entailed vitalization of stimulation policy in the sphere of biotechnologies. Since the middle of the 1990s, governmental agencies have created specialized departments responsible for biotechnology development by means of research infrastructure creation and conduction of key technologies research, cultivation of high-quality personnel. Various biotechnologies development programs were adopted at the national and ministerial level. Besides, such R&D organizations as Institute of Molecular Biology, Pharmaceutical Industry Technology and Development Center, Biomedical Engineering Center, South Taiwan Science Park were established in the late 1990s. The governmental policy of biotechnology development since the 1990s has been performed via several governmental agencies: the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Council of Agriculture, the National Science Council, the Ministry of Education, etc. Under the democratic political regime, biotechnology policy suffers the impact of contradictions of these governmental agencies which try to represent their responsibility area as the most important. On the other hand, institutional pluralism in the sphere of government policy formulation and implementation in the sphere of biotechnologies had a positive effect because by the 2000s Taiwan has not determined its technological and economic advantages in this industry yet. As the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power in 2000, it continued the biotechnology development policy, the national biotech development program was launched in 2002. Implementation included establishment of biotechnology science parks providing their residents with favorable conditions. Within 5 years several specialized science parks were constructed in Taiwan: Biotechnology Plaza in Nankang, Biomedical Park Chupei, Chiayi Herbal Medicine Science Park, etc. In the process of development of biotechnologies, the DDP administration applied the same strategy as KMT government used to develop semiconductor and electronics industries. However, due to several specific features of biotechnologies, the strategy was not as successful as expected. The main reasons of these results include the absence of specific development strategy for biotechnologies, the lack of international S&T support, comparatively weak participation of ITRI, competition between governmental agencies and low cooperation between them.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Taiwan; science and technology; external influence
AB In spite of diplomatic isolation Taiwan is deeply involved into the global economic system. Taiwan's policy of science and technology development was influenced by external powers in different ways. First of all, Taiwan has a highly export-oriented economy, and development of high-technology industries would be impossible without large-scale export of high-tech product to the global market. In 1982, high-tech products made up only 18,3% of Taiwan's exports, in 2005 this share increased up to 50%. Second, Taiwan S&T policy experienced political, economic and ideological influence of the USA. Taiwanese technocrats, who graduated from American universities, were the advocates of the Western economic theories. Moreover, they maintained a lot of personal contacts with political establishment and business in the USA. These relationships allowed them to attract American experts and top-managers for consultations that contributed to the S&T policy formulation and its effectiveness. Technology transfer from the Radio Corporation of America (USA) gave an important impetus for independent science and technology research within Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) which became the driving force of high-tech industry in Taiwan. Another important source of influence is the People's Republic of China. Before the 1980s when no economic and trade ties existed between two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the threat from the mainland consolidated governing elite in Taiwan and made it focus on economic development. Economic reforms started in the PRC in the late 1970s, its rapid industrialization and rise of regional competition forced Taiwan to pay more attention to high-tech industries. On the other hand, in the 1990s Taiwanese firms started to move production facilities to the PRC. Starting from 1996, the government of Taiwan restricted investments in high-tech production in PRC, while giving more preferences to high-tech companies in Taiwan. It also urged Taiwanese government to continue active S&T policy, although the whole economic system of the island was under the deregulation process. However, in the beginning of 2000s, the restrictions were loosened to let the local business reduce costs. Nowadays, competition of the PRC and the possible hollowing out of the most competitive industries and innovations is one of the major challenges for Taiwan.

DE Taiwan; science and technology; interest groups
AB Dynamic science and technology development of Taiwan since 1970-s was entailed by the number of internal and external factors, the main of them, however, was the government policy. Till 1987, while the state of emergency remained valid and under the conditions of authoritarian political regime of Kuomintang, it was Taiwanese technocrats who worked out science and technology policy. The technocrats being loyal to presidents Chiang Kai-Shek and Chiang Ching-Kuo, to some extent were under the ideological influence of the Western science schools, had extensive personal and business relations with the Western, mostly American, businessmen and officials. The technocrats faced little influence from local interest groups as the latter were weak and discrete. Taiwanese technocratic government set up a strong science and technology base, promoted the establishment of state-funded research institutes (ITRI, III) and Hsinchu Science Park, which became the basement for the rapid S&T development of Taiwan. Political and social changes started in the second half of 1980-s resulted in democratic transition, emergence of legal opposition in 1986 (Democratic Progressive Party) and the transformations of how political decisions were taken. Democratization of Kuomintang regime has led to complication of science and technology policy: on one hand, the competition between various governmental agencies has started, on the other hand, different interested groups gained enough power to put pressure on the government. Taking biotechnology as an example, in 2000-s, under the democratic conditions Taiwan's S&T policy has been a compromise of the following political powers: 1) executive agencies (National Science Council, Council of Agriculture, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Academia Sinica, etc.); 2) political parties (green coalition under DPP, blue coalition under Kuomintang); 3) business groups: small and medium-sized enterprises as they are the most wide business layer, 4) academics, scientists and experts. Each power strives for promotion of its interests, allocation of resources and subsidies, carries out independent researches in its own realm. The power of the technocrats has eroded in the 2000-s, and this term is now seldom used to describe politicians in Taiwan. Although democratic transition has undermined the power of technocrats who created science and technology system of Taiwan in 1970-1990-s, by the 2000 the private sector has become mature enough to sustain S&T development. The quantitative S&T indicators show that Taiwan S&T system remained its growth pace and become more private-funded and independent.

DE urban development; urban regime; "growth machines"; urban space

AB This paper analyses the urban political regime that has emerged in post-Soviet St. Petersburg. There is a widespread belief arising from sociological research into urban policies that when the administrations of big cities require rapid financial capital increase to replenish their budgets there is high probability that a symbiosis will appear combining the institutional benefits of the local authorities with the investment opportunities of businesses. Such coalitional regimes can be termed "growth machines" and are aimed at the maximization the participants' profits through the efficient transformation of the urban space. This is additionally backed by a rhetoric of "progressive development". In fact, the actual interests and demands of urbanites are often ignored by these "growth machines". Based on qualitative research of city-planning conflicts between local communities, construction companies and the city authorities in St. Petersburg over the period 2005-2012, this paper discusses the national, local and situational specifics of the formation and performance of "growth machines". It also reveals that, irrespective of how "real" the informal arrangements between authorities and businesses are, the major actors in these conflicts often resort to the discursive construction of negative images of "growth machines" in an attempt to discredit the opponents.

In the second half of the 19th century two processes were recorded by scholars: the active involvement of the medical professionals into social control and the phenomenon of the medicalisation of the political discourse (L. Engelstein, D. Beer, M. Mogilner). Probably, the transformation of the medical estate into profession took place in the first half of the 19th century. This article explores one of the mechanisms of this process. the evaluation of the knowledge of the candidates to the rank of the staff doctor and the doctor of medicine. The birth and the evolution of the genre of the dissertation review, history of the convention concerning the scope and the nature of the knowledge of the doctor are traced on basis of testimonial cases from the Achieves of the Moscow and Kazan Universities. The author detects the forms of the bureaucracy's participation in these processes and it helps to establish how the regulatory agreement between state and profession elite was concluded, how new type of social state had been shape in Russia.

AB Continuity in philosophy can be traced on two levels. The first is the ideographic level, fixing processes of filiation of ideas. The second level summarizes the cultural, social and psychological factors of philosophycal development. Ideological and philosophical continuity can be performed both in the mode of acceptance and denial (when ideas are adopted from opponents during the debate); directly (from teacher to student) and indirectly (when the tradition is reborn through the generations). Certain institutional weakness of Russian philosophy until the second half of XIX century led to a number of features that have become traditional for the Russian philosophizing Historically unspecialized forms of philosophical creativity dominated in Russia; late development of philosophical culture led as a result to high dependence on imported spiritual content. In a social context, philosophy in Russia has long been associated with religious and political free-thinking Starting from the first centuries, a thinker in prison or in exile is a typical figure for Russian culture, the phenomenon of durking (forbidden) philosophical literature is also characteristic of it. Leading vectors of philosophizing in modern Russia (Marxism, cognitivism, postmodernism, contextualism) genetically and typologically are rooted in the history of Russian and Soviet philosophy.

DE capitalism; capital; inequality; Thomas Piketty; Karl Marx; Rastignac's
   dilemma
AB Professor Thomas Piketty (Paris School of Economics) formulated the original conception of the historic development of economic inequality in his book "Capital in the 21 century." Piketty's inequality explains the long-term empirical observation that during the last 250 years, the capital rate (r) was consistently higher than the level of economic growth (g). Piketty's inequality is considered in the context of the study of long-term development of capitalism in modern times. This article discusses the changes in the approach to the study of inequality after Karl Marx and Simon Kuznets. The mechanism of divergences and convergences of income are briefly reviewed.
   To determine the degree of concentration of capital in different countries, Piketty compares the upper decile (10%) and the top centile (1%) of wealthy families. It turns out that the "Rastignac's dilemma" (what is more favorable - to study hard and to marry successfully) may be relevant today, when the level of return on capital comes back to that of "Belle Epoque" of the late 19th and early 20th centuries A brief description of the key criticisms of Piketty's inequality is given, and the debate about the role of human capital in historical perspective and solidity of the fundamental laws of capitalism are examined. The desire to democratize the economic knowledge caused "pikettymania" that enabled millions to pay attention to the relevance of the problem of inequality. The breakthrough in understanding the problems of inequality at the beginning of the 21st century includes a new approach to political economy, combining economic theory, historical statistics and meritocratic imperative.

AB A humanitarian catastrophe is still insufficiently investigated phenomenon in social sciences. The main topics of the article are humanitarian catastrophe as a form of all-embracing risk society, its specific social order and ways of life, its uncertainty and turbulent character, a barrier role of modern bureaucracy in mitigation of the catastrophe's consequences, and the limits of rehabilitation of affected population and ecosystems. Seven major features of the above phenomenon have been identified and analyzed: first, risks engendered by the catastrophe equally embrace an institutional system of a society, habits of life, natural and man-made ecosystems; second, every catastrophe has a dynamic character: in the course of its development some of its agents loss their power while others gained more strength. As a rule, starting as a local conflict the catastrophe gradually acquires an international character; third, the processes of socio-ecological metabolism generated by a catastrophe have no definite space-time margins; fourth, these processes generates so-called unintended consequences and have an uneven and probable character; fifth, the above catastrophes are of two kinds: a sharp overall destruction (with recurrent after-shocks) of a natural and human community and its long-term 'peaceful' extinction which is risky as well; sixth, a behavior of bureaucratic machine responsible for the render of humanitarian assistance is an important indicator of value system of a given society; seventh, the author came to the conclusion that the majority of economic and socio-political catastrophes are not the 'unintended events' but presents by themselves a cumulative effects of a long chain of daily events. In the end, any long-term catastrophe is a humanitarian one.

It argues that, despite the current engagement of the OSCE in Ukraine and its renaissance in Russian politics, the task of revitalizing the OSCE has not become easier. The German Chairmanship may be considered a success if it manages to unblock political dialogue within the OSCE and to redefine the agenda for future structured dialogue, which could be accepted as a fair deal in conjunction with the wider debate over a vision for a Wider Europe.

AB The purpose of the article is concerned with the description of political processes in the Siberian regions. Political processes are analyzed as part of the modernization process. According to the authors it is possible to discuss and describe different stages of perception of the phenomenon of regionalism. First, regionalism has seen from the point of view of the resistance against the modernization process if modernization was described as the centralization of the state. The next stage connected with development of more sophisticated approaches to the phenomenon of regionalism. For example we can discuss the possible use of "new regionalism" concept to describe the dynamics of regional processes. The authors use the path dependence theory connected first of all with different types of Soviet socialist industrial modernization to analyze the dynamics of the political process. In particular, the background of Irkutsk region political polycentrism connected with it. According to the authors of the article there are some links between some periods of Russian history concerned the relations between the Centre and regions/ These relations always have been characterized by the ideology of building "vertical of power". These ideas are clearly manifested in the modern designation of governors by the Centre. Unlike the "alien" governors regional parliaments were the original "training centre" for regional policy. The article also examines the possibility and potential impact of outside factors connected with the today geopolitical changes in the world and then with the socio-economic and political changes in the Eastern regions. Contemporary outside challenges can lead to the actualization of the "Eastern vector" of Russian foreign policy that will affect the redistribution of the center of gravity in Russia from the Central Russia to the Eastern regions. Also we can say about upgrade and creation of new meanings and senses concerned power ideological concepts of "moral conservatism" and "nationalization of the Russian elite". In terms of "turn to East" these ideologies can be perceived and evaluated by Russian Eastern partners as corresponded with traditional Eastern values.

AB The history of academic activity in the Northeast regions of the Soviet Union in 1930s-1941 on the basis of analysis of the archival data and the published source material was considered in the article. The beginning of this period is related with reorganization of the Academy of Sciences and its factual "sovietization", the ending - with restructuring the work in accordance with the wartime requirements. The paper presents the reconstruction of history and shows the meaning of implementation of the most important academic initiatives - scientific and consulting investigations of the Commission (Committee) on the Permafrost, the botanic expedition in the Lena River Delta in 1935, the expedition to Wrangel Island in 1938, Yakutsk Expedition of the Council for the Study of Production Forces and the Obruchev Permafrost Institute in 1938-1940, investigations of the Yakutsk Research Permafrost Station and the All-Soviet Union Conference on Development of Production Forces of Yakutia in 1941. The author determines the key factors, which have influenced the scale and line of academic research in the North-East (strategic activity vector chosen by the governing body of the Academy under the influence of the government authorities and connected with the provision of the economic and business development of the country; the social and political situation in the Soviet Union, and occurrence of the new important actors - The Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route and structures that were affiliated with the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs. It has been established that the region being studied became the most important testing area for theoretical knowledge development and field experience of various problems of the applied permafrost study in the beginning of 1940s; and geocryology became the core, around which the transition to the brand new stage of academic activity in the North-East took place, that is its steady state study by the Academy of Sciences.

AB Despite the fact that Robert Harley is known as Tory politician, he began his career as a Whig politician. His grandfather and father were Presbyterians, and Robert Harley himself was a Presbyterian during his entire life. Harley's family supported the Glorious Revolution of 1688. In 1689 Robert Harley was first elected to the House of Commons as a representative of the Whig party. Thanks to his wife's Foley family, Robert Harley was elected as a commissioner of public accounts in the House of Commons. In 1689 Britain entered the "war of King William" which was a burden for many gentry (Whigs or Tories). Robert Harley became famous in the parliament as a critic of the war and corruption in the army. In 1693 the Whig leaders headed the ministry and continued the war. Their policy divided the Whigs party in two factions: "Court Whigs" and "Country Whigs". Robert Harley and his supporters became "Country Whigs", and they criticized the "Court Whigs". By 1700 Robert Harley joined the Tory party.
   The article also describes the evolution of historiography of Harley's policy. Victorian historians have called the Prime Minister a "stupid person". The same opinion was repeated by Russian historians of the 19th century. But in the 20th century the assessment of Robert Harley's activity was changed by the works of K. Feiling, G. Holmes, B.W. Hill and other historians. Soviet historians (for example M.A. Barg) also called R. Harley a "mediocre politician", but modern Russian historians (L.I. Ivonina, T.L. Labutina and others) consider him a "clever statesman" and a "master of political intrigues and parliamentary diplomacy".

AB The author believes that the governmental regulation of a society is one of the bases of conservatism. He thinks that the state exists in order to protect society and a person from forcible manifestations and free understanding of personal liberty, from non-state coercion and even violence, from manifestation of egoistical personal and corporate interests. Power of the state considerably increases when it relies on traditions of the past rather than the ideals of the future.
   The conservatism as a political trend historically developed as force fastening a public organism. The author of this article believes that only conservatism possesses the real stabilizing resources capable to consolidate society of modern Russia. The author also recognizes that nowadays government and public institutes make certain efforts for overcoming certain social diseases.
   The continuity and progressiveness of the state and social development define fundamentals of ontology of conservatism as the world outlook and a political trend. The Russian State is still at the stage of transition period. The formation of strong democratic institutes has not yet been completed. One of the main problems is the need for public consolidation. Now only the conservatism has sufficient resources and opportunities for the solution of this problem.

AB The article raises the question of the ontological commitments of a semantic theory. It is demonstrated that Tarski's semantics is independent of any theory of truth. We justify the semantics' independence of ontological commitments related to the quantification of the variables of a particular object theory. The main difficulty in using the category of ontological commitments author sees is that the semantics refers to the metalanguages level, while the methodology of the analysis of ontological commitment is designed primarily for the field of the object's interpretation of quantifiers. The second important point is that the study of the ontological commitments should be conducted in relation to the theory, but not in relation to the language. In this paper, we justify the ontological neutrality of the meta-language as a language of semantics. The article presents the idea that the Tarski's semantics is indifferent to the choice of the theory of truth. Semantics defines the general conditions of material adequacy for different theories of truth, and the famous Tarski's scheme can act as a universal criterion (canon) to determine the inadequacy of a theory. Tarski present confusion in his semantics of the two points of view to solve the problem of the ontological (metaphysical) nature of the semantic theory. Tarski simultaneously emphasizes a metaphysical neutrality of semantic theory, and at the same time its relationship with the correspondence theory of truth. It is very difficult to interpret in the spirit of ontological neutrality of the semantics. The article presents the rationale for distinguishing the semantics from a theory of truth. If the language is neutral to the existence or non-existence of certain objects, the ontological commitments passed on theory. The W. Quine's concept of ontological commitments has no consistent differentiation of the language and of the theory; may be, it is related to the features of artificial languages that are always constructed on the basis of some theory. The problem of ontological commitments moves from semantics as language to the area of semantic as theory. However, the semantic theory presents as a meta-theory, and for that reason to talk about the object quantification of the variables in the statements of metalanguage is problematic enough, because for this purpose it is required to enter abstract objects.

The description of the most convenient, efficient and least costly measure by which it is possible in the short term to diagnose organizational culture. Presentation of the results of the proven OCAI techniques in education. Methods: A content analysis. Results: The necessity of changes in organizational culture of the higher education departments are proved in the article. On the basis of the comparative analysis with popular measurement models of organizational culture the advantages of the OCAI method are shown. Diagnostics by OCAI technique is the most acceptable instrument of measurement if it is estimated according to a validity, time/material inputs and carrying out researches by the institution staff. The approval of this technique is presented on the example of the pilot sociological study conducted in one of the departments of higher educational institution. Scientific novelty: It is revealed that OCAI contributes to solving the main problem, which is stated by A. Toffler, namely the adaptation of organizations to changes in the management of OC. The advantages of using OCAI are described. Based on the research problem, the solution identified which will contribute effectively to the management of individual departments of a university. A set of measures to promote rapid, effective reform of institutions of higher education is described.

DE the Enlightenment; rationality; spontaneous socialization; tradition
AB The inheritance of scientists of past is being reevaluated on modern stage of science development, especially it's well seen in the sphere of social science. Two works of American scientist F. Fukuyama - The end of History and The Trust - are a landmark of this transition. The transition is a way from categorical defense of universal rationality which is resisted by local traditions to rational estimation of the whole variety of elements and mechanisms. The way is figural named as the way between Weber to Berk. These thinkers are usually opposed to each other, the first one is as a proponent of rationality in the spirit of the Enlightenment and the second one is as a defender traditional values. But our paper brought to light their common position in this sphere. It can be possible due to deeper exploring of definition "tradition", which is allow to look from a different perspective at thinkers positions. According our position, tradition is not a kind of a solidify ritual but is a special symbol system of information handling which realizes functions of storage and transfer of data and knowledge, legitimating of activity, creating the intention of social field building. In our view the difference of the thinkers' biased attitude is in their different attitude towards the society as a system. Berk's stance reflects opposition of the tradition and tradition of the Enlightenment, but Weber divides the tradition and tradition of Reformed Faith, so it's obvious their points of view are distinct ideologically not functionally. Dictatorship is inappropriate for both of them, but Berk says about the necessity of conserving of different nature mechanisms to keep freedom, Weber, in the spirit of the Enlightenment, insists on the only one way for development. According to author's view Fukuyama's The Trust is marks a methodological turn which allows to widespread the notion of rationality to incorporate a wide range of factors in researching models with the aim to reflect reality in better way. Postmodern philosophers criticized the Enlightenment for its categorical orientation, ironically it is a characteristic any tradition. Every tradition creates its own social field, but social space consists of abundance of social fields. Coexisting, superimposing on one another the fields let each other develop. Substitutions which are born in common areas and borders between traditions' fields, is an accelerator of this process.

ID HOLISM
AB In this article we try to formalize, summarize and classify some Zeno of Elea's arguments "against any plurality of a being". We show that these arguments can be interpreted as revealing the difficulties in describing the relation of the whole and its parts. In the first group of these arguments the whole is considered as "non-holistic" one, and a contradiction is derived from this, and in the second group the whole is considered as "holistic" one, which is about, on the one hand, some difficulties in identifying the parts of this whole, and on the other hand it is about an infinite regress. It is shown that there is a connection of these arguments' meaning and structure with some cases of Plato's and Aristotle's identifying mereological difficulties (some Plato's and Aristotle's texts belong to the first group, and other - to the second one). In addition to the properly mereological difficulties, these arguments are associated with several discussions in Plato's "Parmenides", "Theaetetus" and others dialogues. Those discussions are aimed to demonstrate the impossibility to constitute a bound object (and in this sense the "whole" one), if such a connection or relationship as "participation" (in "Parmenides") is used. Also those discussions are aimed to demonstrate proposition inability for one proposition to be a "part" of the other proposition (in "Theaetetus"). Also, these arguments related to the discussion of the impossibility of the formation of a complex proposition from simple ones in Sextus Empiricus. We show that Sextus' arguments on the incomprehensibility of the intentional object of one cognitive power by other cognitive power, on unknowability external world's objects, on the impossibility to grasp anything through its designation, on a regress that arises in searching criterion of truth or justification, too, are all of Zeno's type arguments. The same type of argument applies to a famous problem of Neoplatonic metaphysics, which was clearly expounded by Proclus: how the First Cause can be completely independent of their effects, and? At the same time, to be related with them as their cause? However, in this case, there are difficulties with the identification and individuation of ta eide in Nous. Those difficulties are similar to the difficulties which arise in trying to distinguish between interdependent propositions - if in this propositions' distinguishing we use the criterion of G. Frege. If these arguments generalize and formalize, they can be incorporated into a modern discussion of holistic systems (W.V.O. Quine gave the impulse to this discussions): the assumptions on which the description of holistic systems is based, lead to serious difficulties; but to give up these assumptions is in many situations more difficult than to agree with them - as can be seen from the work of M. Harrell and M. Esfeld. In addition, we show how the arguments that use an infinite regress, can be presented in convincing form to meet the strict criteria of C. Gratton, and how the "viciousness" of the regress under consideration associated with paradoxes identified by B. Russell at the beginning of the XX entury.

DE space; phenomenology; body-oriented paradigm; world-oriented paradigm
AB There are two phenomenological paradigms in space analysis: body-oriented paradigm (Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty) and world-oriented one (Martin Heidegger). In this article we will consider key features of the body-oriented paradigm, shortly examining its relationships with the world-oriented one. Husserl and Merleau-Ponty refuse to understand space metaphysically, i.e. as an abstract object uprooted from the life world and acting subject. Their post-metaphysical understanding of space begins with the analysis of constitutive role of human body as a "zero point" setting system of coordinates for human orientation in the world. This creative aspect of human body (incarnated consciousness) reveals within the analysis of spatial thing perception (E. Husserl) and intersubjective dimension of body experience (M. Merleau-Ponty).

DE concept of God; classical theism; process theism; Patristics;
   soteriology; creatio ex nihilo
AB The paper suggests a new approach to the Christian concept of God on the basis of the soteriological arguments which played the decisive role in the history of the Christian theology. The traditional concept, also known as "classical theism," describes God as the greatest conceivable being, the maximum of all perfections: knowledge, power, goodness etc. Moreover, this God is absolutely simple, timeless, immutable, impassible, and transcendent. The problem with this concept is that it is not clear how such a God can be able to create, love the creation, and respond to the suffering of creatures. Contemporary Christian philosophers struggle to minimize the incompatibility of classical theism with biblical God, producing reasonable but still not quite convincing solutions. They discard one of the classical attributes, e.g. simplicity, timelessness or the knowledge of the future. "Process theists" deny God's absolute non-temporality, immutability and impassibility. All of these approaches operate within the logic of the maximally perfect being, while merely adjusting the list of perfections. Yet changing one or two attributes does not make a big difference as long as the ultimate principle of maximal perfection remains intact. Whereas the history of the crucial Christological debates shows that the most influential orthodox arguments were built on another principle: maximal salvation. Regardless of what exactly was understood by salvation, there was a common intuition to maximize it even at the expense of God's perfection. Therefore it is not alien to Christian thinking to introduce a concept of God based on the soteriological principle, where God is rather the maximal savior than the maximally perfect being. It is not enough just to add salvation to the list of perfections; it should be treated as belonging to the definition of God himself. Since it is characteristic of God to save, salvation is his primary activity, i.e. he necessarily always saves. Therefore 'to save' should be understood in the same sense as 'to create': to make something from nothing, life from death, a saint from a sinner. Such creation-salvation is not contingent, but necessary for God, while human creativity, contrary to process theism, is different: it is contingent and not ex nihilo. As in classical theism, God remains radically different from the world, since only he is the one who creates and saves. But as in process theism, God is rather dynamic than static, always involved into the life of the world. Thus the suggested soteriological theism can serve as a middle ground between the traditional classical concept of God and the process concept.

AB The present-day unstable geopolitical situation reinforces political, economic and reputation challenges for Russia. The necessary of transfer to an innovation way of development seems evident. The choice of an innovation paradigm as a main vector of the state development is a key condition of support of strong position for Russian Federation at the international arena. Economic basis for an innovation way of state development acquires the pronounced political slant. The theme of innovation development today is one of the methods of home and foreign policy positioning of the Russian state, forming of convincing home and foreign policy image. In the context of traditionally existing paternalism model of the Russian state system the role of the state in making of an innovation economics and forming of an innovation culture is determinant. In the article the instruments and mechanisms, which the state uses for support of innovations, are researched. The review of the official documents for support of innovation state development is carried out. The current innovation infrastructure, including science cities, centers for collective use, engineering centers, is analyzed. Such innovation institutes as technological platforms and clusters, are viewed. Such mechanisms for innovation support as federal target programs and state funds for science financing, are examined. The mechanisms of support and stimulation of innovation research activity in the universities field (government regulations. 218,219, 220, 9 April 2010) are researched. The political decision about the choice of innovation paradigm in development of the Russian state system at the present stage has been made, and now the main task is to establish conditions for maximum optimization of innovation modernization process at the state, industry and scientific educational levels. Taking into account the pronounced political problems of the transfer of the state development to an innovation way in the face of the scientific political science community today the serious challenge has existed for forming of the recommendations for working out of the strategy of state innovation policy positioning - as for home politics, so at the international arena. The convincing policy in the field of positioning of the innovations as an essential characteristic of the Russian state system further to the system strategy of the practical support of the innovation environment will influence on overcoming traditionally low demand of the Russian economics for innovations, reinforcement social economic potential of Russia and improvement its image characteristics in the world community.

   conservatism; Eurasian regionalism
AB The historical works on the Siberian oblastnichestvo have been greatly enlarged in recent years by philosophical reflection concerning studying of main socio-philosophical and cultural-philosophical ideas of Siberian oblastniki. This article presents an attempt to analyze the existing liberal-conservative divide in the Siberian regionalist movement (using primary materials connected with the intellectual heritage of the Siberian oblastnichestvo's leaders - N.M. Yadrintsev and G.N. Potanin) on the basis of Bakhtinian dialogism. For M.M. Bakhtin, truth of being can't be adequately perceived in a monological way; truth needs to be explicated by means of a dialogue that creates the "polyphony" of mutually addressed and contradictory voices. According to such methodology the analysis was carried out on two interrelated levels - on the one hand, microdialogue within the philosophy of each thinker separately and, on the other hand, external dialogue between Yadrintsev and Potanin. In spite of evident similarities arising from sameness of philosophical origins (their Siberian patriotism was a unique embodiment of the enlightener purposes and simultaneously had an accented liberal-nationalist character), the trajectories of Yadrintsev's, and Potanin's philosophical thought essentially diverge in some aspects. First, if Yadrintsev's philosophy of history is subject to progressist monism leading him actually to liberal eurocentrism, Potanin in his turn comes to Eurasian regionalism that is firmly rooted in the conception of cultural relativism. As for the problems of social ontology, the researcher also found out considerable divergences between two thinkers. It is specified that Yadrintsev's social theory has been affected by positivism and utilitarianism. As a consequence, he justifies liberal individualism, although the conservative voice of his microdialogue insists on the necessity of communitarian values in Russian peasant community. Trying to solve this conflict, Yadrintsev demonstrates a utopian scenario according to which the spirit of solidarity and ethical motives of "common good" could be actualized after the negative period of individualization and power of selfish interests. On the contrary Potanin, sharply criticizing the private practices of capitalist arrivistes, finally establishes an anti-individualist social theory of initially conservative type.

TI KRIPKE MODELS FOR BADIOU'S ONTOLOGY AND PHENOMENOLOGY

DE ontology; Badiou; Kripke models; Kripke semantics; set theory; theory of
   object; forcing
AB In Badiou's philosophy two approaches can be recognized. The first and initial one is an ontology based on the set theory and Cohen's forcing method. It is presented in "Being and event". The second and late one is phenomenology or the theory of object, to which Badiou's second major book "Logics of worlds" is devoted. Both approaches admit various interpretations but perhaps one of the most natural of them is that suggested by Kripke models. The latter not only provide us with a proper semantics for Badiou's theory of object but also is instrumental in tracing a connection between his two approaches. The article deals with building Kripke models for early and late Badiou's philosophy, for his ontology and phenomenology. It first demonstrates two ways of constructing Kripke models. The first way follows Kripke's own presentation and happens to be useful in building a model for the initial Badiou's approach since it is based on the procedure of forcing. Thus Badiou's subjective procedure from "Being and event" can be depicted as a movement along the tree of possible worlds in a Kripke model directed to a final world determined by the generic set, this set itself being a collection of possible paths leading to this world. Moreover, subjective judgment (based on forcing) corresponds to subject's positioning in a particular world with particular formulas satisfied. The second way to construct Kripke models makes use of Goldblatt's reformulation of them in terms of hereditary sets and Heyting algebras. As demonstrated, this makes possible providing a semantics for Badiou's theory of object. Since these two formulations of Kripke models are equivalent, a ties between two Badiou's approaches thus established. In particular the subjective procedure from the early "Being and Event" can be considered as a special case of object from Badiou's late phenomenology. In addition, this allows us to demonstrate that the logic of both Badiou's approaches is intuitionistic. The article also considers few instructive examples.

DE ontology of film; affective disposition; scepticism; incomplete being
AB The present article is devoted to theoretical issues of ontological researches of cinema within the framework of new, developing scientific field of philosophy of film. The general particularity of philosophy of film, its tasks and problems is considered in the paper. The ontology of cinema is presented as one of the most important paradigm of philosophical criticism of cinema. There is given a definition of ontology of cinema in terms of conventional conception as an investigation of essence, a search of all-encompassing idea of film. The crucial difficulties of the construction of ontology of cinema are stated and analyzed in the text. Firstly, there is emphasized a problem of concern for good object by which we mean desire of researcher for constituting cinema as real or possible love object. It is assumed, that this desire is caused by empathic feelings suggested by movies, as well as by directive of film studies to articulate taste preferences. Secondly, the problem of transformation of ontological categories influenced by cinematic experience is designated in the article. The transformation is due to dialectical interpretation of indivisibility of form and content in cinema. Ultimately it results in the viewed world of movie is endued with mode of being. This way not only category "being" and related to it "matter", "space", "time" and others are rethought, but radical doubt of Humean type about any ontological laws is actualized. Finally, it is noted that significant obstruction of ontological theories is a problem of incomplete being of cinema. Cinema as an elusive object, evolution of which is radical and extremely unpredictable, is a possibility of its own future realizations. In this regard it seems it is impossible to take an ontological approach motivated by directions of essentialism to film. Meanwhile, it is assumed that overcoming of specified problems is reached through revision of classical model of ontological analysis. By virtue of conception by M. Heidegger, it is suggested distinguishing of notions "essence" and "being". It allows to reformulate the question of ontology of cinema: a question "What is cinema?" is changed by such questions as "What is existence of cinema?" and "How is cinema?". In turn, in view of close correlation between designated problems and subject and his consciousness, it seems that phenomenological approach is a pre-requisite to ontology of cinema.

DE I. Kant; subject; transcendental Ego; empirical Ego; moral Ego;
   metaphysical Ego; person; thing
AB The article discusses the Kant's theory of the subjectivity in four different ways: as the doctrine of the transcendental Ego, the empirical Ego, moral and metaphysical Ego. The article analyzes the arguments of Kant on the various difficulties in the methods of givens and knowledge of the empirical, transcendental and metaphysical Ego. Namely: the transcendental Ego can not be known, since it is not given in any experience. Also it is not possible to apply the category to it, since it itself is the source of categories. The only thing we can know about it - that it is. Metaphysical Ego can not be known just like any other thing in itself. Knowledge of the empirical Ego is not different from any other object of knowledge: the same mistakes and errors, the same obstacles and barriers. Next, however, Kant's theory of moral Ego justified to overcome the Cartesian formulation of Ego: Ego as the person in the opposition to Ego as the thing, res. In conclusion, the article argues for the importance of Kant's theory of I for the subsequent tradition:
   1) Opening of the formal structure of subjectivity, namely identity;
   2) The statement of the impossibility of ascribing to Ego predicate "absolute", "infinite". Because of several factors: a person endowed with the ability to sense perception, but not endowed with the capacity of intellectual contemplation; human reason given by the questions that principle can not answer; people in the ethical sphere imposes a requirement (imperative), what needs no one holy being.
   3) Overcoming the understanding Ego by analogy with natural things and reception of this doctrine in the subsequent tradition, in particular, a statement of the actual mode of being of the Self.
   4) Fixing impossibility expansion of personal integrity. Demonstrating the importance of this doctrine by the example of the reification of the Jews in the practice of the Third Reich.

Critical assessment of the existing education system is given it is shown that the modern education is aimed at a model of unsustainable development. Education and training at school is proposed as a platform for sustainable life styles in order to implement sustainable development strategies. It is proposed to transfer to a new system of education: education for sustainable development. The methods and concepts of environmental education are considered as appropriate to sustainable development paradigm. The methodological basis of this study is the dialectical method as the confrontation of traditional education system and the requirements of the transition to a sustainable model of education. Scientific methods are used, such as abstraction, idealization, comparison, modeling, analysis, synthesis, etc. The solution of the investigated problem is based on the statements and conclusions on the studied subjects contained in the writings of modern Russian and foreign authors, researchers and philosophers. It is concluded there is need and possibility to establish a system of education aimed at sustainable innovative development of a society. The conception of school (Eco-schools), and a system (model of environmental education, the introduction of a variety of disciplines, etc.), are proposed as well as gradual steps of transfer of the education to sustainable development.

DE China; Confucius; political language; socio-political lexis; political

AB As the title implies, the article describes Confucius study as a part of political language. It gives the detailed analysis of different public acts and documents, various media publications and speeches of Chinese politicians which demonstrate the influence of Confucius ideas on the political language of modern China and shows the degree of their reflection in the political lexis. First of all, Confucius had thought that the speech should be simple, clear and short. It should come from the bottom of your soul. Confucius believed that social disorder often stemmed from failure to perceive, understand, and deal with reality. Fundamentally, social disorder can stem from the failure to call things by their proper names, and his solution to this was rectification of names. If names are not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things, and it leads to unsuccessful business. The author shows how these speech requirements influence the political language today. The article goes on to say that not all Confucius ideas are used in the political language. Sometimes politicians can change the actual meaning and employ them for their own profits. Among other ideas modern politicians emphasize the idea of rectification of names, the idea of the importance of continuity, the idea of significant meaning of connections between generations, humaneness, laws which should be based on justice, and the idea of honest officials. The article proves that the influence of Confucius is manifested not only in the specific political decisions, but also in political language.

Methodologies of analytical and phenomenological philosophy express one essential feature of time on their own different languages, dialects: contextuality and datability. Questions about the beginning and the end of time, about when and by whom it was created, about mysterious "archive" of past and future are senseless, nonsense. Natural language allows you to build senseless sentences, so the acceptability or unacceptability of sentences should be established pragmatically. It is essential for senseless sentences that it does not admit of the possibility proof / refutation. But besides the illusory nature of these problems shows that the possibility and the necessity to build ontology of the natural world do not arise.

DE film semiotics; cinema; visual culture
AB Problem of meaning in cinematography had been developed in works of major semiology theoreticians, such as R. Barthes, Y. Lotman, K. Metz and U. Eco. Each theory of cinema and methodology of its analysis has specific features. Researching and comparing of these features will help us to understand the nature of meaning representation in cinematography and visual communications. R. Barthes offers conception of the "Third meaning" for interpretation of cinema. Third meaning is a special instance of meaning that is being held in a film without any signifier. According to the Barhes this makes the "filmique" part of a film, the indescribable meaning that pushes the viewer outside the frame in search of sense. Besides the idea of third meaning R. Barthes insists on the methodology that focuses on the frame or photogram analysis. This approach makes semiotics of film vulnerable to the problem of signifiers relations in motion. Because film is not static we have to pay attention to the signifying role of motion. Another researcher who worked on semiotic theory of cinematography was Yuri Lotman. He had proposed a model of an adaptive cinematographic code that is able to produce new codes by destroying old ones. His conception could be compared to the K. Metz ideas on the role of a code in construction of a meaning. According to Metz cinema exploits codes that were already created by music, literature etc. Thoughts on film semiotics were expressed by U. Eco. He assumed that visual communications shouldn't be explained in terms of linguistic. He had described "the third code element" that acts as a complementary element of a two-dimensional code. The importance of U. Eco position should be explained by the role he gives to the third code element. This part of cinematographic code opens a wide perspective for signifying in the film. We can mention that semiotic approach to the visual culture and cinematography has two methodological ways of development. Discrete analysis of a visual phenomenon - is the first way. According to this methodology researcher supposed to divide frame, picture or scene into signifiers and build a scheme of its combinations that demonstrate the process of signification. The other way is to work with concepts of third code element with a purpose of researching if codes interaction in the cinema.

AB Fictionalism as a nominalistic philosophy of mathematics can be considered as a direct antitheses to the Platonism. The latter asserted the existence of abstract objects and objectivity of mathematical truths about them. Fictionalism, on the other hand, considers the literal accounting of mathematical propositions as a false one because fictionalism denies the existence of mathematical objects. As a consequence the direct accounting have to be replaced with metaphorical reading. Some arguments for implausibility of fictionalism are suggested.

AB The paper considers cognitive heuristic models in Marx's theories. The author shows that representation of reality using theoretical constructs is an obligatory procedure of Marx's scientific methods. This procedure is done using cognitive heuristic models which vary depending upon the objectives of an investigation. Combining models is Marx's usual method of using models to develop the theories of history and society. It makes the theories systematic and heuristically effective.

AB The paper is devoted to the analysis of such problem as crisis of natural (biological) foundations of modern civilization. It turned out that in accordance with the integrated essence of man and society, he can only be understood as a holistic, socio-biological in nature. The number of disturbing trends in various aspects of biological life (somatic, psychological, genetic). As was shown they have many common features. The author believes, therefore, that the crisis has a common mechanism of action at its core. It is connected with objective differences between modes the social and of the biological existence. If the first one is based on the conscious human practice and of became more and more dynamic during the history, the biological mode of existence is more static and conservative, is associated with adaptation to the environment and the need to maintain homeostasis. Accordingly, the crisis occurs when social change is so intensive that human biology does not manage to adapt to them and gets into state of maladjustment. An important conclusion is that the crisis is not necessarily coupled with simple regression and degradation but also can appear during progress. Crisis in itself is the situation of instability, uncertainty, when the development can go further both uplink or downlink. A.P. Nazaretyan the concept of an evolutionary crisis. Namely with this type of crisis we are dealing in the modern era, when in the course of scientific and technological revolution the main spheres of society demonstrate unprecedented acceleration. Situation arises turbulent development, which is called a bifurcation point in synergetics. Finally, as has been shown, co-evolutionary movement of the social and biological gets disturbed, between them occurs desynchronization. Since modern transformation of society is associated with its transition to a post-industrial phase of the existence, the informational sphere plays in the described processes crucial role. Overall growth of stress and also consistent isolated stimulation of nervous system takes place. Because of its central regulatory role this makes negative effect on all systems of the human organism. In the end, the author concludes that further progress is impossible with overload of human biology, so that the strategy of solving crisis should be connected with finding an optimal balanced type of coevolution between social and biological dimensions.

AB Evolution of the methodological paradigm of historical research, more themes and methodological tools of historians in the period under review were inextricably linked with the process of transformation of the party-state policy of the USSR and the reform of the Soviet society. The turning point in the study of the history of the Soviet society in the Institute of History was the establishment of the Department of the History of the Soviet Society in 1954. Already by 1951, 702 dissertations on the history of the Soviet society were defended in the USSR, while 899 candidate theses were on the entire pre-revolutionary history. These figures clearly show the tendency of formation of the Soviet period history as a leading branch of historical science in the Soviet Union. Researchers of the first postwar decade were mostly interested in the periods of the October Revolution and the Civil War in the USSR. After the war, under the leadership of Saratov State University topical scientific issues to be examined in the following five years were formulated. Historians suggested exploring a complex topic "The Great Patriotic War and Saratov Region". Once the History Faculty had its first Doctor of Sciences, Vasiliy K. Medvedev, the Department of USSR History of the Soviet Period was organized at the initiative of Dean V.A. Osipov. In 1965, WWII veteran Dmitry Polikarpovich Vanchinov became an Associate Professor of the Department. Since then an intensive study of the history of Saratov Region during the war began. Several doctoral research works by Saratov State University scientists were made on the history of the Soviet society - a thesis "Saratov Volga Region during the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945" (1973) by D.P. Vanchinov, and "The Social Functions of Historical Science in the Great Patriotic War" by G.D. Burdey (1990). The studies at the departments of Stalingrad Pedagogical Institute of the period covered several areas of historical research. Along with the trends of the national historical science the Department of History of the USSR expanded the range of research on the history of the Soviet period. Particular studies focused on regional issues. Several key areas in the study of the Soviet period were defined: the first was related to the study of history of Tsaritsyn and and of the Civil War, the second studied the history of the Great Patriotic War and the Battle of Stalingrad, the third - the role of the CPSU in the history of Stalingrad-Volgograd. Directions of historical research, as in previous periods, were largely determined by the development of historical science. The latter, in turn, under the Soviet socio-political system characterized not only the results of historians' research, but was also set by the party and government directives.

AB Germany's defeat in World War I and proclamation of the first German republic significantly influenced the change of the role of the army in the German state. At the stage of reorganization of the Kaiser's army into the Reichswehr (1918-1921) the main result of this transformation became the creation of a new model of the German Army in which the principle of "distancing" the army from politics was replaced by new legislative and political realities that raised the question of inevitability of relationship between the army and the state. The Versailles Treaty and the Weimar constitution put forward the task of turning the German army into integral part of the state apparatus which led to losing its apoliticality. They also contributed to the emergence of Reich Ministry and the post of Reich Minister combined in one person the representative of the army and the state power. Besides, they helped to form a united German professional army and provided joint search of allies in the field of armaments by politicians and military men. The army tried to defend the old Prussian military traditions in terms of the German State called itself the Reich, and Weimar politicians sought to put the army under a parliamentary-presidential control. At the later stage of the Weimar Republic political generals will appear in the army, and important government positions will be taken by the representatives of the Generalitat. But the outcome of the force balance already at the stage of development of the temporary Reichswehr, when the real power in the army was in hands of the commander of the ground forces, and not of the Reich President and Reich Minister largely predetermined the strength of the conservative military elite in the future.

AB The progress observed at the present stage in the field of high technologies in various areas raises the issue of rethinking the role of innovation in social development and innovation policy as a driving force of change. This article discusses the main theoretical approaches to understanding innovation and innovation policy in the works of foreign and Russian authors. The author aims to provide her own definition of the basic concepts used in scientific discourse on innovation policy, to identify and to describe briefly the main theoretical approaches, to identify similarities and differences in various fields of scientific knowledge and to draw conclusions about the applicability of existing concepts to the content of her own dissertation research. The above analysis shows that innovation theory is at the preparadigmatic stage and can be applied to research in terms of international relations. Within the framework of political science, the question of the ideological justification of innovation policy and the role of ideological concepts in practice of government agencies, as well as the relationship between scientific approaches to innovation policy with political ideological approaches require further study. The study of academic literature has shown that there is no fundamental research to fully reveal the complexity of the evolutionary process of developing innovation policy.

AB Modern geopolitics updates for Russia the problem of a convincing foreign policy positioning. Escalation of the political situation at the post-Soviet space and necessity of defense of national interests show the importance of the problem of Russia's perception by its foreign partners and opponents and that of forming a ponderable foreign policy state image. In the article the conceptual fundamentals of forming the international image of a state are researched. The categories "image" (as produced), "image" (as existing), "brand" with reference to country imagology are studied. Basic points of view in domestic political science in the field of the international image forming are analyzed. A conclusion about a high degree of topicality of working-out of scientific methodological and practical recommendations by Russian political science community in the field of construction of the foreign policy state image is drawn. The set of instruments of Russian internal and foreign policies for the country's positive international image formation, from foreign policy propaganda to international scientific and technical collaboration in science intensive branches of industry, is researched. The formalized position of the Russian state structures in the part of document basis of the strategy for the foreign policy positioning is examined. The main political institutions and organizations, functioning for an effective positioning of Russia at the international arena, are explored, and the reasons of their insufficient effectiveness are analyzed. The problem of the mono-orientation of Russia's image as a primary resources power and need in its diversification due to the characteristic of "innovativeness" is set. The necessity of inclusion in the global innovation infrastructure demands making effective mechanisms for introducing Russia to the world community as an innovation state capable to be a leader in science intensive spheres. In the article the global interdependence of Russia and the leading world powers is indicated. In spite of the temporary political coolness, full isolation of Russia in the present-day conditions is impossible, and the problem of its effective positioning may be partly moved to the field of science and innovations for a potential softening of the geopolitical situation. It is the author's opinion that an effective measure for the formation of the Russian Federation's positive image for the world community is involvement of international partners in the joint research- and production projects with the use of innovation instruments.

This paper argues that all the diverse communication practices have the following attributes: transpersonality, semiotic structuredness of discourse, identity. The first attribute - transpersonality, caused dependence communicative practices of government transparency intentions and actions of collective actors. Transpersonality expressed through a sense of comfort provided avoidance of individual decisions, the search options for sharing of collective action. The second attribute- semiotic structuredness of discourse manifested in the formation of symbolic capital power. In this process, more than ever closely linked semiotic and communicative processes. The third attribute of deliberative politics - identity, lifestyle shows involvement of a particular group. It can be local and global in scope. Public discourse is not so long ago was the subject of discussion in the theory of communication. In this context, the analysis of communication practices from the perspective of a theory of communication is important.

DE modernization; anomie; deviation
AB The article focuses on the existing theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of the phenomenon of social anomie in relation to Russian society. We give a brief description of the two main approaches to the issue of social anomie. The first approach is formulated E. Durkheim. Anomie - a consequence of the transition phase in the development of society, when the old norms no longer apply for the regulation of social interactions and relationships, and new ones have not yet formed. The second variant of anomie formulated Robert Merton. In the social structure itself has a failure, which causes various forms of deviant behavior as adaptive response to this failure.
   In this paper we detail consider the models of social anomie N.E. Pokrovsky, S.G. Kara-Murza, C. Swader and L. Kosals. Explores the strengths and weaknesses of these models applied to the study of anomie in Russian society. Found that some models do not take into account the global context of events. These models consider the Russian society in isolation. In the model of DKA, the proposed C. Swader and L. Kosals contrary, considered insufficiently specific cultural and historical factors of Russian society. Of great interest is the methodological approach to measuring the level of anomie proposed C. Swader and L. Kosals. They link anomie with the modernization process, which is accompanied by the formalization of various aspects of social life. By formalization in this sense, they refer to the shifting of society's principle medium of normative control over individuals from the informal, based on interpersonal close ties and face-to-face relationships, to the formal, based on abstract, rational, and codified institutions. The authors examine and measure the formalization of social control in three areas of social life: economic, political and individual values. Model anomie of C. Swader and L. Kosals is called "don't know" anomie (DKA). Authors consider as a key indicator of anomie uncertainty of respondents in existing norms and their application. This is the only model currently authenticated by empirical research on the Russian sample.

TI Russia and the Caucasus: Lessons of History in the Light of New Studies

DT Article
AB The Caucasian region was always a problem for the Russian and then the Soviet state. In the post-Soviet years, it has faced several wars and periods of instability and is almost continually exposed to terrorist threat. Political destabilization leads to economic and social ill-being. The authorities have to search for forms of government that could correspond to the specifics of the situation. Obviously, the search for such forms is doomed to failure without knowing the sources of many modern processes and turning to events that happened several tens and hundreds of years ago.

TI MODELING OF POLITICAL FUTURE IN PARTIES' PROGRAMS

DE party's program; political modeling; political future model; concept of
   the future
AB Today the scientific interest for political parties' programs is included into the subject-matter of actual problems of political science due to the fact that modern political parties are a relatively new phenomenon. Programs, doctrines and ideologies that are textually and conceptually designed, require relevant researches.
   However, although the interest for the problems of political texts is apparent, the party programs themselves with their structure, association with ideologies, doctrines, and parties still remain on the periphery of political studies. Similarly, the researchers of political parties, ideologies, and electoral process pay attention essentially to the problems of current situation: political statements during electoral campaign, actual conclusions etc.
   Therefore, the relevance of the present study is in the fact that within its framework a fragment of the semiotic political world picture is shown. This picture is reflected in the presented political parties' programs.
   Also, the relevance of the study is determined by the fact that the problems of political language and political conceptology are an integral part of political studies in Russia and abroad. For the contemporary political studies the most important concepts are those that reflect the essential elements of political consciousness of the nation. Their complex presents the political sphere of concepts of a particular nation.
   Contemporary researchers of political concepts evolve a number of basic political concepts which are notable for the political discourse: "politics", "power", "people", "state", "justice", etc. The examined in this research concept of the future is basic not only for political discourse, but for person and society in general, in fact, the sense of the future is implanted in the human nature.
   And finally, a comparative study of the model of the future expression on the material of ruling parties of Russia and a variety of foreign countries (the United States, Great Britain, France, and Italy) is extremely relevant in the current period of global economic crisis. Such a research provides the basis for the optimal model of the future determination that can become a universal one for the electorate of different countries.
   Thus, the author examines party's program as a part of political communication system and characterizes the model of the future. On the basis of comparative study the author determines common and specific features of the model of the future expression. He divides into groups the considered political parties' programs.

AB This article attempts to explain the necessity to modernize the Russian political system and to implement the national innovative strategy. The need to strengthen and to develop the fundamentals of innovative-typed society - human potential and social capital - is analyzed on the basis of national empirical research. Today, humanity has entered the innovative information stage of development, where creative and active potential of a nation signifies one of the primary resources for achieving the status of a competitive state. The following characteristics become of the utmost value in such a society: independent and critical thinking, responsibility for the decisions, leadership and mobility. Unfortunately, the conditions for transitioning to the innovative type of society are not so favorable in Russia. Low birth rate, high mortality rate, underdeveloped state institutions, bureaucratization of goverment apparatus, brain drain from the periphery to the centre and abroad, weak legal culture and other social problems hinder the development of the innovative characteristics among Russian citizens. Russia needs to strengthen the fundamentals of the innovative-typed society, as there are positive impulses for its development (energy and raw material resources, high scientific potential, recognition by the most active part of society that the systemic transformations are necessary). The article presents the statistical data, which points to the need to invest in the development of the innovative personality characteristics, and the necessity to implement structural modernization of the specific areas of human capital.

DE revolution; performance; political ritual; Ukraine
AB The analysis of the works of E. Burke, A. de Tocqueville, B.N. Chicherin, A. Fouillee, and S. Moscovici on political philosophy, political psychology of masses provide an opportunity to look at revolutionary alternative as a kind of performance, the sense of which contradicts even the Jaures' interpretation of it as a "barbaric form of progress". The article shows a political revolution as a mass action that is drawn up as a play, whose task is to hide the reverse nature of upcoming changes. Revolution itself is not able to change the nature of institutions, relationships, society and personality. In this context the image of the future becomes an announcement of the revolutionary performance. Stage, actors, theatre performance change the mass from the audience into the play's participants. The problem is revealed through the example of Ukrainian events. A carnival according to Bakhtin transforms very quickly into a bloody revolutionary action according the lows of crowd psychology. The Maidan becomes an embodied triumph of revolution changes over parliamentarism, while maintaining the form of performance. The Ukrainian revolution has shown that the country connects its past with Russian dominance and its future with entrance into the European Union without the temporal self-definition. The revolution has complemented the spatial split of Ukraine into West and East by the mental split that occurred 420 years ago during the Union of Brest into Catholics (noblemen), Greek Catholics (common people of Western Ukraine) oriented to Poland, and Orthodox who were regarded as pariahs. The author analyzes the role of radicalism and patriotism in the revolutionary society where traditional political culture is completed by technological scripts of revolutionary protest.

DE mythic-heroical political reality; political communication; values;
   sense; facts-constructs; image of the enemy; motive of the Victory
AB In the conflict of values in Ukraine both sides use the same mythic-heroical scheme that simulates two parallel political realities that are expressed in terms of propaganda. The reality of this type according to its genesis can be called "nominative" one, i.e. it is simulated by the very act of denomination as "heroes". However, the phenomenon of heroes depends also on the designation of enemies, that is why exactly they play a major constitutive role. The feature of the political myth under examination is in its incompleteness: instead of creating of the full version of monomyth and phenomenon of Saviour, micro history of a battle between collective heroes and their enemies is constructed. Due to the importance of this mythic construct a great attention is paid to the image of the enemy, which is deprived of human nature (as it is reflected in the discursive forms "Colorado" and "Banderlogs"). The mythic motive of the Victory over the enemy is also in the semantic connection with the heroic fight. In the process of development of this motive the idealization of the past occurs, which is also understood in antithetic way: Soviet / anti-Soviet. Here the symbolic war of flags begins when Ukrainian national flag is confronted with St George's flag (sometimes tricolour). Also herocities are reproduced as mythic subjects of a new reality from the category of Soviet symbolic attributes. But the main conflict is associated with general cultural categories of "peace" and "anti-world" that represent the image of the future mythic world which includes values of each party to the conflict. In the format of such a discursive conflict the effect of negative political communication appears, when each side becomes isolated in its own semantic world. As far as each of the worlds is a world of heroic political myth, they can not communicate in general. The fact is that "one's own" world - is full of meaning, and the "outsider's" world is meaningless. As a result, this principal emotional language of heroic political myth makes the pragmatic dialogue impossible, all this highlights the problem of a semantic translation.

AB Economic, political and social changes in Russia occurred in the nineties of the twentieth century predetermined the emergence of a new socio-cultural situation, which in turn led to the transformation of the style and quality of the existence of the society, its public relations, value orientations. With increasing destabilization of the socio-economic, value and intellectual foundations of the post-Soviet space steady adherence to humanistic traditions established in the European and Russian sociopolitical and philosophical thought seems to be of current importance for domestic libraries. The educational function of the library is one of these traditions.
   Russian libraries have traditionally played a significant role in the educational activity. From the standpoint of culturological approach, a library is a part of the cultural continent, i.e. a library existed within the culture for centuries, changing and transforming externally and internally. A special mission and considerable work for creation of the spirit of culture, its formation and strengthening is assigned to the library.
   Today the post-Soviet library community returns to the idea of enlightenment, overcoming skepticism of the nineties of the twentieth century, when on the wave of reckless deideologization this concept has become associated exclusively with the propaganda activity and therefore disappeared from the lexicon of library scientists and practitioners for a long time. Return to the ideals of the enlightenment is performed at a different level. Possibilities of implementing the educational function are conceptualized and developed in the context of other socio-cultural conditions.
   In view of the current socio-cultural situation the educational mission of the libraries is interpreted as ensuring development of the human potential (intellectualization of the society) through continuing education and free access to the cultural heritage of mankind for all members of the society.
   Preamble of the Code of Professional Ethics of a Russian librarian approved at the regular session of the Russian Library Association (May 2011, Tyumen) indicates that understanding of the librarian mission in the society is no longer fit into the framework of mediation, but includes objectives of conservation, development and dissemination of the cultural heritage of the nations of Russia. The educational activity of the library is implemented through a set of all its functions, and those which are most inherent to a certain type of libraries dominate in this process. Therefore, educational tasks of the libraries of different levels vary. For a scientific library the educational task is much more mediated and can be identified with its basic information function, and broader with providing optimal conditions for the implementation of the latter. That is, educational goals are "dissolved" in the information function of the library. The main purpose of the academic (scientific) libraries can be formulated as the utmost contribution to establishment of the objective scientific truth through information support of the learning process.

DE body; corporeality; social construction; construction levels of body;
   "natural body"; "social body"; "cultural body"
AB Topical tendencies of development of philosophy and social sciences are characterized by a return to the problems of the human body and corporeality. The body is treated as an individual way of being human in the world. Relationship of the physicality of people with the cultural-historical and social space of their being, interpersonal communication practices and disciplinary political discourses determines the interpretation of the body emanating from its social constructedness. To study the process of constructing the body a conditional division into three levels is methodologically advisable: natural, social and cultural. Construction is carried out on all three levels which should be considered continually. Criteria of differentiation of these levels are: the specific explication of the body as an object of construction, the purpose pursued during the construction, and possibilities of the collective impact on the individual. In accordance with these criteria, the structure process of construction of the body takes the following form: 1) natural level: the body appears as a living organism with certain restrictions in its transformation; the purpose is adaptation to the environment and the survival of the organism; collective impact is minimal and is mainly based on the level of development of science and, in particular, medicine; subjects of construction of the body are individual scientists and the person with its unique set of preferences and attitudes; 2) social level: the body is part of the relationship with the Other, the boundary between the inner and outer worlds, a socially significant formation represented to society by means of a regulation of the vital functions; the purpose is establishment of communication and harmonious / effective relationships with the reference communities and specific individuals; influence is carried out directly by the social environment and within certain social institutions in the course of socialization and interpersonal communication; 3) culture level: the body is mediated by sense, the body is text carrying the information on belonging of the person to this or that subculture and manifesting the value orientations of the subject; the purpose is setting priorities in accordance with the historically established overbearing traditions; influence is made by the (sub) cultural communities and culture as an integral system. Construction of the body occurs in the field of gender differentiation. The binary opposition "masculine / feminine" can also be considered through the prism of the three levels. Owing to systemacity, integrity of the human being, reduction of the body to one of the levels of its explication is wrongful and in practice it leads to negative consequences for the individual and for society as a whole.

AB During the postwar years the Soviet telecommunications has undergone profound qualitative and quantitative changes. Its development during this period was determined by the rise of science as well as the rapid growth of certain sectors of the economy. Great positive influence had significant changes in the geographical distribution of productive forces, the development of new economic regions of industrial and agricultural production. One of the drivers of progress of the communication facilities were the achievements of national science and technology, in particular - radio engineering and electronic industry. Telecommunications management system included the following main units: USSR Ministry of Communications and its main (central) sector management; Administration of Commissioners of the Ministry of Communications of the USSR by the Councils of the Ministry in the Union Republics; regional government of the Ministry of Communications; county, city and district offices of the Ministry of Communications. Communication facilities in the period under review were classified primarily on the basis of their primary purpose and administrative and economic subordination. From this point of view, they were divided into two groups: public communication facilities and departmental or special purpose facilities. Ways of development of telecommunications in the second half of the last century, particularly in the 1960s-1980s, stages of the strategic objectives of the government in this sector were identified in a complex project of the Unified Automated Communication System (UACS). UACS project organically emerged from a planned economy and the political line of the USSR, took into account the possibility of financial, material and human resources. The primary strategic goal was to create a unified multi-channel network of telecommunications lines - primary network of the UACS. It was a network of typical transmission channels and group paths formed by a set of nodes, stations and signal telecommunication lines - cable, radio relay, air, etc. On its basis secondary networks were constructed. Thus, the fundamental direction of the development of telecommunications technology was the integration of various communication media, the creation of a network that could be used to transmit all kinds of information. Beginning with the integration of standard communication channels later this process affected the commutation stations.

   policy; imperial federation; commercial union; nation-building; Canadian
   statehood
AB The article analyses the political views of Canadian intellectuals which had influence on the formation of Canadian political culture at the turn of the 20th century. The author confirms that the Canadian intellectual thought was the main ideological factor in the conditions of the formation of Canadian statehood, undeveloped party and political system, the lack of deep traditions of the parliamentary system, insufficient political practice and the lack of distinct ideology of basic political parties in the process of forming the Canadian nation.
   On the basis of studied Canadian sources, the author makes conclusion that the most of Canadian intellectuals did not participate directly in the political process and they considered themselves its bystanders. Besides, the Canadian intellectuals promoted the British political culture of the Victorian epoch. Although all of them were familiar wih the British socialistic thought - Fabianism, they insisted that the social transformation in the Canadian society is possible only through the improvement of moral system, the education of lower social classes and the maintenance of elite monarch traditions. The American influence on Canadian political culture was peripheral at the beginning of the 20th century. The ideas of the Chicago Sociological School and the European continental thought were not used. The Victorian intellectuals understood their time as the social crisis and their political discussions were often devoted to the problems of imperialism, religion, education and feminism. They undoubtedly influenced the Canadian political elite in the matter of further development of the Canadian nation and state, but they expressed their own unique views on the contemporary society in academic press and in elite clubs discussions. They did not share the opinion of publicity about contemporary social processes, because their position was far from the direct party policy.

DE subject; justice; truth; actor; individualism
AB The central theme of the work is study of the concepts of justice and truth in modern and postmodern philosophical literature. In the article a general tendency in a law and philosophical literature is shown as a trend away from the "transcendental grammar" in interpreting the terms subject, justice, truth.The author uses antic literature images Odysseus and Polyphemos for explaining the differences between two models of understanding justice, truth. Disclosure of social scope, functional purpose of a human as member of society, hint at possibility of social laws similar to physical ones - all these create "ideology of subject", which cannot be separated from ideology of masses (party, class or nation). The paper notes the relationship between philosophical models of society and the concept of man as a social figure and law ideas of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Researcher demonstrates the usage of new social and philosophical methodology to the study of the scope of the rights and law relations. The author analyzed the influence of the philosophical concepts of individualism on the development of theories of justice in the twentieth century (J. Rawls, J. Zehr).The author analyzed the development of ideas of civil rights system and the social role of state. One of the objectives of the work was to demonstrate the main trends of comprehension of subject autonomy within the framework of modern and postmodern culture traditions.Modernity is characterized by the changing of attitudes to the value of the political and social structures. Individualization of society has led to changing of the importance of social roles of person, and appearing a new operating structure of human world. The author proves the necessity of a new topos formula of personality which reflects the status of equality, law activism and fundamental social and political transformation of society. Citizen means the actor of the social space, which changes the circumstances of his being in the world. The ideas of "returning of the actor" and "personalization" of society revealed the interdependence of man and the environment.

DE intuition; mathematical knowledge; ideal common objects; axioms;
   mathematical intuition; contemplation; direct knowledge
AB This article discusses the role and place of intuition in mathematics, the ratio of intellectual thinking and intuitive contemplation. This study involves the relation of logical and intuitive knowledge, as well as determining the objectivity of truth obtained without evidence, then, with the help of intuition. The most important aim of the work, including the novelty, is to attempt a philosophical explanation of new discoveries, identifying logical and intuitive process of "enlightenment" of mathematical creativity. Contemporary Mathematics retains many features of previous epochs, but has its own characteristics. It is an extremely high level of abstraction and idealization of science, of considerable complexity of new mathematical models. Intuition peculiarity is detected when forming mathematical theories. We can give as specific examples four theories of mathematics, which have already proved this fact. We mean the theory of categories, non-standard analysis, the theory of odd sets and catastrophe theory. The algebraic theory of categories appearance, its heuristic potential testified the fact that mathematical knowledge is carried out in accordance with the basic principles and laws of materialist dialectics. On the one hand, being dependent on the set theory, it serves its further generalization, releasing mathematics from the individual (specific) form. As a result, the categories theory itself acquires the ability to be suitable for the study of a wide class of mathematical theories. Category theory destroyed dogmatic notions of set theory universality and uniqueness to be the foundation of all mathematics. It has laid a new foundation for both the theory of sets, and mathematics as a whole. Its heuristic opportunity was expressed in the ability to describe the properties and relations of mathematical objects from various areas of science. New horizons were opened for algebraic geometry, mathematical logics; it became possible for the theory of sets to construct a new type of models. Nowadays it is undoubtedly possible to use the fuzzy sets theory in computer systems in automatic control systems (eg, trains, banking industry), in medical diagnosis, in chemical engineering, psychology, sociology and other fields of human activity. Catastrophe theory is considered as a set of mathematical and physical ideas that have "exit" in geometry, algebra, analysis, topology, singularity theory, bifurcation theory, nonequilibrium thermodynamics, synergetic, dynamical systems theory and other fields of science. The author emphasizes the specificity of mathematical intuition to understand the world. Interpretation of mathematical knowledge in the tradition of non-classical epistemology, especially through intuition greatly expands the horizons of knowledge. The intellectual intuition plays a special role in explaining and justifying of the latest discoveries. The history of the mathematical knowledge development shows how important the role of intuition in mathematics is than in any other area of scientific knowledge. The intuition regularities identified on the basis of mathematical discoveries can be useful beyond basic sciences themselves.

DE semantic non-determinism; fuzzy logic
AB The notion of semantic non-determinism and its relation to the notion of fuzziness are considered in the paper. This notion is governed by the non-determinism of a domain and is formally modeled with N-matrices. These matrices include sets of truth-values, instead of a single representation. The choice of a truth-value from a certain set is random. Sematic determinism has outstanding advantages in modeling non-deterministic queries, faulty logic gates, etc. The notion of fuzziness, being fundamental for the theory of fuzzy sets, represents many-to-one relation, while the notion of semantic non-determinism - one-to-many. Fuzzy logic, which is based on fuzzy sets, handles linguistic variable "Truth" with a range of truth-values [0, 1]. Our supposition is that fuzziness - non-deterministic concept. Non-determinism in fuzziness is implicit, and we suggest alternative consideration of a grade of membership as an interval value. This consideration allows us to have a different look at the Sorites paradox. Main operations of the fuzzy logic are overridden in the terms of the intervals, and an effectiveness of the redefining is confirmed by the computer experiments.

DE rationality; types and forms of rationality
AB The problem of rationality is directly connected with the conditions of implementation of the model of a human being. The analysis of various approaches to rationality fulfilled in the article does not claim to be complete. The analysis is concise and may be fragmentary. Identification of trends of modern conceptions of rationality based on the evolutionary processes is the main aim. Discussions on the nature and content of ''rationality'' are impossible without elucidation of the historical reasons. Main approaches to rationality in various fields of traditional knowledge (philosophy, economics, sociology, etc.) and interdisciplinary courses (economic sociology, neoinstitutional economics, economic psychology, etc.) are presented in the article. A study of the evolution of the conception of rationality in various fields of science allows revealing the forming tendencies of this issue further research. Identification of the bases of rationality polysemy leads to the understanding of the existence of different types of rationality. A sufficient variety of types of rationality can be found, for example, philosophical, social, humanitarian, political, economic, etc. Different and contradictory approaches to rationality are typical on the current stage of the rationality ideas development in the economy. It has been established that the development of the rational behaviors notions was caused by contradictions between the theoretical and real data, as well as by excessive abstractedness of the rational human beings model. The above factors allow identifying new approaches to the study of conceptions of the model of a human being and the peculiarities of their implementation in practice, understand the variety of forms of rationality, and obtain complete representation of the problem of rationality in historical, gnoseological, sociocultural, historical and scientific and other aspects. The changes of rationalities conceptions can be caused by the formation of the world. According to classical science nature was regarded as an object, but in postnonclassical world the nature acts as a subject, which also includes the cognoscitive man. Rationality should not be rejected for solving current problems of economy functioning, the rationality conceptions of various types and forms should be rethought. The fact that introduction of rationality in society, economy and nature is not unlimited should be considered. The analysis of approaches to rationality revealed the tendencies of modern conceptions of rationality based on evolutionary processes, the prospects of their convergence on interdisciplinary base. During conducting the research in the field of rationality, irrational and unpredictable elements should be taken into consideration. One of the possible approaches is the model of strategic objective (otherwise the model of rational concordance of interests).

AB The article is prepared with the support of London School of Economics and Political Sciences in the scope of implementation of research projects "Imperial Identity in Britain and Russia: Scotland and Ukraine, 1707-1914" (2010) and "Modernizing Empires: Regular State on the Margins of Europe -Britain and Russia in the Age of Reason" (2013). The article analyzes the attempts of the British Military responsible for the appeacement of the Scottish Highlands in the first half of the 18th century, to localize rebellion with the help of military topography and ethnic cartography. The material deals with the representation, interpretation and use of cartographic information about the Highlands. Rhetoric strategies of the military cartographers, their aims and role are also the objects of the analysis. In the light of the evidence provided by the most famous analysts on the state of Scottish Highlands and, respectively, on the "the Highland Problem" (support for the second restoration of the Stuart dynasty on the British throne from the disaffected clans which were armed and loyal only to their chiefs), with the help of the analysis of official and non-official documentary on the "Highland Problem" and keeping in mind sense of active corporative unity which was spread among the Military during the first half of the XVIII century, respecting colonial questions and policy on the other imperial margins, the author sought to concentrate research of military topography and ethnic cartography of the "Highland Problem", represented in this article, on the data represented in "The Description of the Highlands of Scotland" (1731) by Clement Lempriere. In the end it is possible to conclude that the data collected and arranged by Clement Lempriere was not sufficient for the military aims during campaigns against the rebels in the Highlands and served as a frame for account of General Wade on his deeds as Commander-in-Chief in Scotland since 1725. The construction of ethnographic map, invention of historical tradition and pretension on the knowledge about ethnography of the Highlanders and geography of the Highlands helped to make empirical issues more concrete from the administrative point of view and to move up to the new level of colonial knowledge. In such circumstances the military topography and ethnic cartography were used to integrate military and political geography and administrative ethnography for the solution of the "Highland Problem".

AB Retrospective conditionality of the novelty of "factual statement" is defined for us again (at an arising situation) manifestative urgency of earlier implicit structure; condition of concept representation - is the condition of possibility to see; grounds of the conflict of research programs is always the next conceptual shift of our vision, instead of "observable" theories, changing of which is the result of same conceptual shift, but an the micro level. Understanding of the novelty of "factual statement" in retrospection, of course, demands justification and new aspect of vision (well-known to us up to this fact). The article also formulated and considered the possibility of "observational theories" out of research programs. If to consider the factor that the theory as that is a specific organization of relationships of a certain quality elements, conditioning such type of relationship, it is necessary to recognize that "observational theories" are impossible out of research programs. Therefore, we cannot and should not allow the back in the view of system needs of such organization. On the example of the analysis of the possible grounds of I. Lakatos's abstract statements is presented a concept that limit justification of theoretical systems is an acceptance of a certain situation, which in itself is a statement of the impossibility of further rational research in this direction.
   It is supposed that the retrospection draws our attention speak in images, to earlier missed opportunities. And it is happening (retrospective analysis may indicate problematic steps of reasoning) for the reason that at the time of this analysis specified problems are already solved or removed from the agenda due to lack of the possibility of their future solution. Consequently, retrospective conditionality of the novelty of "factual statement" is defined for us again (at an arising situation) manifestative urgency of earlier implicit structure.

DE cultural and historical type; internal dynamic; relative modeling
AB In the paper it is shown that the problem of internal cultural dynamics within the bounds of relative modeling supposes clearing up the mechanism of development of historical and cultural types as separate and qualitatively original cultures. The internal cultural dynamics for the cultures with a harmonical paradigmal centre is an pendulum oscillation according to the scale of mental values: cultural and civilizational. Each pole - cultural and civilizational in mental nucleus is a bound in that aspect when the predominance goes over certain critical limit, coming and statement of the opposite mental dominants (cultural and civilizational) immediately begins. This swining between civilizational and cultural poles in their mutual self-affirmation and expansion provides comparatively boundless dynamics of culture as constant change of epochs at all times where civilizational or cultural values predominate. Moreover there is no strict changing i.e. obligatory changing of the epoch with dominate certain civilizational values by the epoch with dominate certain cultural values. Evolution of the West European culture is an illustration of such situation. Internal cultural dynamics is reconstructed as unavoidable collapse, death for the cultures with unharmonical paradigmal nucleus. Evolution of ancient culture, Roman culture is an example.

DE functional aproachment; social practice and moral education;

AB In our article we are trying to tell what is so called Functional Aproachment i n researching morality, why it was so important especially in soviet ethicists? At the same time the western philosophers as "neutral" for politics tried to research morality by braking phrases and sentences to simple moral statements, but was it really neutral? We discover why functional aproachment could be probably current for now days for changing "social reality". In some sense it specifically belongs just to Soviet philosophy, because it wasn't neutral to politics it had some kind of political directedness, but at the same time it was directed to change reality for a better life, even especially succeed in it. So researching of function of morality, not content of, was inherent to Soviet philosophy. Revival of moral research in Soviet thought was difficult, because it tried to make own concept of "separate" philosophy, which was different from so called bourgeois philosophy. The article also makes some parallels to universal prescriptivism of R.M. Hare and a soviet author Oleg Drobnicki which considers that they both tried in some sense to unify Kantian universalism and utilitarianism, and the both lately were accused of so called natural fallacy. Education of the soviet people was a main point for ethic as a science, and it was aimed to be adequate and objective, that was extremely difficult in the 60th of the last century in Soviets, but philosophical sophistication was growing up in the Soviets, so ethical thought was renewed from long oblivion impacted by cruel moralization of the communist party. Anyway, even renewed philosophy was a little bit eclectic, but it made huge progress in justification of the Soviet system and in making ethics real science, separated from moralizing philosophy. It was considered in making new educational process, in which a lot of individual qualities are not contradict society, especially in Drobnicki's so called ethical conceptualism, both societies values and individual are complementing each one. In some cases his philosophy is or was quite close to Ethical socialism in getting together neo - Kantian theory and Soviet Marxism. Attempted by Drobnicki's synthesis significantly weakened, at least at the level of theory, the thesis of the class nature of morality he has created a special concept of the concept of morality, not going, however, in its substantive component.

DE epistemic-paradox-of-Moore; formal-logical-inconsistency-of-thought;
   two-valued-algebra-of-formal-ethics; evaluation-function;
   formal-axiological-inconsistency-of-activity
AB A new approach to Moore's paradox is developed by considering the epistemic modalities not as true or false propositions but as good or bad actions in two-valued algebra of formal ethics. A precise evaluation-functional definition of the notion "formal-axiological-inconsistency-of-activity" is given. It is proved that Moore's paradox is not a formal-logical-inconsistency-of-thought but a formalaxiological-inconsistency-of-activity. The proof of formal-axiological inconsistency of Moore's absurd-sentence is performed by "computing" a relevant evaluation-table in the two-valued algebra of formal ethics. In this algebra "knowledge", "assumption", "faith", "doubt", "skepticism" and other epistemic modalities relevant to the topic are considered not as attitudes to logic forms of either true or false propositions but as either good or bad action forms deprived of their contents. In general, "knowledge", "assumption", "faith", "doubt", etc. are considered (and precisely defined) in the paper as moral-evaluation-functions determined by finite sets of moral-evaluation-variables. In the two-valued algebra of formal ethics these variables take their values from the set {g (good), b (bad)} in the proper moral meanings of the words "good" and "bad". The evaluation-functions take their values from the same set. Elements of the set are called "moral values of actions (and action-forms)". Moral-forms of simple actions (deprived of their contents) play the role of (axiological) variables. Moral-forms of compound actions (deprived of their contents) represent moral-evaluation-functions. Complex moral-action-forms are obtained by applying moral (formal-ethical) operations to the variables. In the two-valued algebra under consideration a precise evaluation-functional definition of the notion "formal-axiological-law-of-activity" is given. According to this definition the absurd-sentence noticed by Moore is a violation of formal-axiological-law-of-activity. On the set of moral actions and moral action-forms (deprived of their contents) a formal-axiological-equivalence-relation is defined precisely as well. This strict evaluation-functional definition gives a possibility to generate lists of formal-axiological equations in the two-valued algebra of formal ethics. Combining the definition of formal-ethical-equivalence-relation with the moral-evaluation-functional definitions of the epistemic modalities in question heads to an interesting system of formal-ethical equations illuminating the paradox of Moore.

DE Moldavia; Poland; Ottoman Empire; trade; merchants; trade routes;

AB Many scholars have touched the issue of international trade on the territory of Moldavian principality in XIVth-XVIth centuries. The majority of works have depictive historical character and are based on a wide range of sources. These sources include Polish Akty grodskie i zemskie, Russian chronicles, memoirs and notes of medieval travelers.
   The article is based on the complex approach and multiple factor analysis of economic and political processes in historical perspective. The author focuses on different aspects of multilateral trade on the territory of Moldavia in XIVth-XVIth centuries: location of trade routes; key cities and towns on these routes and their role in international trade; merchant diasporas and their trade and political interests; goods and products that played top-priority role in Moldavian international trade. Special attention is given to the roots of growth and decline of the Moldavian trade route.
   The conducted research leads to the conclusion that the economic prosperity of Moldavia in the period under investigation was the direct result of the project of maintaining and developing the Moldavian trade route realized by Moldavian hospodar Alexander the Good. It is owing to this project that Moldavia became an important center of international transit trade. This status had been preserved for more than two centuries and was lost with decline of the Moldavian trade route that occurred due to a variety of objective geopolitical factors.

DE concept; logics; ontology; epistemology
AB There is a problem of conceptual inconsistency in analytic philosophy. That problem is complex or composite, and its decision mainly depends on how we define basic terms used in discussion: individual concept, extension and intension of concept, meaning, sense and others. Apparently, we could define these terms by means of logics, but modern logics has different interpretations of them. Moreover, the term 'concept' is unclear, as well as its metaphysical (ontological and epistemological) status - that is the question of concept structure, correlation with language etc. On the one hand, we could define concepts as mental representations, on the other - as expressions of language (primarily, natural). Accordingly, there are (at least) two points of view on concepts: mentalism and lingua-centrism. Mentalism is a starting point for the most of investigations in contemporary cognitive science; in particular, someone could identify concepts with states of nervous system. Lingua-centrism describes concepts as signs (words, word-combination etc.), meanings of which we precise in every day communication. The question is that: whether we can fix (localize in the brain) such entities as concepts if they are mental representations. The answer is rather 'No' than 'Yes', because a process of concept formation is continuous.

First of all, it is the first attempt of comprehensive publication of letters by German soldiers from the period of Stalingrad Battle from four collections in Moscow, Volgograd, and Stuttgart. Secondly, the book convincingly shows that it is impossible to understand the everyday history of the battle on Volga without studying the letters of German soldiers. Thirdly, the published letters confirm the double role of the Wehrmacht soldiers on the Eastern front: they played the role of both victims and criminals. The reviewer points out the influence of changes in individual and collective memory, as well as state political memory, on historians' methods of working with private documents dated to the period of World War II.

TI CONDITIONS AND FACTORS OF CHINESE INTELLIGENTSIA DEVELOPMENT DURING THE
   SOCIETY MODERNIZATION PERIOD (LAST QUARTER OF THE 20TH CENTURY)

DT Article
DE intellectuals; society; conditions; factors; structure; China
AB The conditions and factors of development of Chinese intelligentsia in the society are analyzed in this article. They suffered essential changes comparatively with the period before the Cultural Revolution. The object and subject, methodological approaches of the research work are defined. Intellectuals became a more active social group that could influence the way, content and the tempo of the reforms. The social structure, functions and the origins of reproduction are exposed to transformation. In the process of economic, political and social transformation the role of Chinese intelligentsia was rising at the end of the 20th century. Further development of China was connected with it. The process of Chinese society modernization in the last quarter of the 20th century was the main condition of development of intelligentsia. It is a small social stratum active in society reforms and its role is significant. Traditional society modernization is a complicated process in all spheres of the society: economic, social, political and spiritual. The state initiated it and governs it strictly in China. The beginning of Chinese society modernization was the Third Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPC in December 1978. Reforms in economy gave rise to various types of property resulting in different intelligentsia incomes, different development rate in the regions of the country, the city and the village. Uneven development of the regions resulted in the "drain-away" to the south. The discrepancy between education, science-technical potential and economic development demands, a large number of illiterate people, poor quality of elementary education, a small number of those wishing to continue education in high schools required changes in the organization and support of educational process, especially in higher school. China successfully solves these problems. An important factor for intelligentsia evolution is education modernization. Chinese government recognizes the fundamental role of education in country reforms. Education, science and culture development is connected with the stronger position of Confucianism. Modern Confucianism mission is to increase national self-consciousness and belief of the nation in its power. It is necessary to form the civil awareness of the population. The following factors helped to create conditions for intelligentsia functioning in China: economic reforms, political and law institutes of civil society development. The adversarial psychological factors were the fear of change, distrust to the outside world, fear of possible destabilization. The conditions and factors for Chinese intelligentsia development in modern society are generally favorable. Chinese intelligentsia is developing in the conditions of a quickly modernizing unitary state with a huge territory and population, traditions, single-party system and powerful position of the center. Reforms of Chinese society show some similarities with the post-perestroika Russian history, for instance, struggle of conservatives and reformists. Unlike Russia, China's state regulation is and was more effective.

TI MODERN FEATURES OF REGULATION: EVOLUTION OF THE CONCEPT AND THE CHANGING
   ROLE OF GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC POLICIES
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE regulation; regulation theory; government economic policies
AB The term "regulation" migrates from one science to another, getting new qualitative characteristics thereby giving rise to a new range of problems for the comprehension of the contradictions of regulation. In this regard, there is a growing need in the study and synthesis of the theories of regulation and regulatory changes from the position of integrity and directions of improvement of state economic policy. Three approaches are suggested describing the prerequisites of regulation - interest, ideas, institutions. The interdisciplinary study of regulation theories allowed identifying the diverse problematic field of regulation: social welfare growth and public interest protection; collective actions of interest groups and competition between them, interaction between interest groups and the state; patterns of collective decision- making and the problem of choice based on selfishness of behavior, differences in incentives, constraints and level of democratization; the choice between alternative real institutional mechanisms of regulation. Regulatory changes suggest the transformation of regulation impulse from problem solving (awareness of the contradictions between the different needs and opportunities, between reality and the possible state) and order (existence of specific requirements) of regulatory process participants into new ideas. This led to a radical change of the role of state regulation in the economic policy of developed countries of the world: expansion of the membership of regulation from state institutions to market, public and supranational institutions; formation of a hierarchical system of decision making at various levels of management; changing of interaction between the participants of the regulatory process in delegating authority, distribution of responsibility (liability), benefits, costs and risks of regulatory impact; emergence of new and presumably less costly forms of regulation as alternatives to state regulation (self- regulation, co- regulation, quasi- regulation); introduction of procedural mechanisms providing expert examination, accountability and transparency of economic and social regulation; institutional design intended to ensure cooperation and reducing transaction costs of institutions in the process of interaction to achieve the flexibility of state economic policy. Ultimately, the main trends of the theory and practice of regulation is to identify the institutional transformations, procedures for creating incentives to achieve social, economic and political effectiveness, rule of law and improve the credibility of state economic policy.

TI THE ACTUALIZATION OF THE CATEGORY "INSIDERS-OUTSIDERS'' IN THE
   IMAGE-BUILDING DISCOURSE IN THE EDUCATIONAL SPHERE
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE educational discourse; image of university; cognitive category
   "insiders-outsiders"
AB Relevance of the research of the image-building educational discourse is determined by a number of extralinguistic factors. First of all, the system of higher education has been located in the center of public and political attention over the past ten years. It was caused by the entry of Russian universities in the Bologna process and the formation of new state-level socio-economic requirements of the Russian education system as a whole. Competition between universities in the fight for entry into the international ratings rises every year. In addition, universities strengthen their positions as important image-modeling factors of regions and cities. An important task for them is to create and promote the university as a brand. Using of the cognitive category "insiders-outsiders'' can be an effective tool of creating a positive image. This category can represent objects at different levels. Universities can use this property of the basic category for self-presentation in specialized media. There are a number of works about the analysis of means of expression of the category "insiders-outsiders'' in various types of discourse in modern linguistics. Basic researches of this category are the researches of dialectal discourse. Opposition of members in this category is universal. As a result, there were researches developed at the confluence of social science and cognitive linguistics and devoted to the study of implementation methods of the above mentioned category in different media texts in Russian linguistics over the last years. The category "insiders-outsiders'' plays an important role in structuring of institutional educational discourse. This article is an attempt to describe the features of its explication in the all-Russian newspaper Poisk (search) texts about the activities of Tomsk universities. Most of the analyzed texts aim at creating the positive image of a particular institution in the reader's mind. The purpose of these publications is the most complete and convincing self-presentation of universities. During the work about 130 feature articles and soft-news have been analyzed. About 50 utterances with the semantics of "insiders-outsiders'' explicated on the different levels of language have been selected. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the basic category of "insiders-outsiders'' is important for educational discourse. It is explicated in the texts of the media on the four levels of language: lexical, morphological, syntactical and textual. Most commonly this category is expressed by lexical units with the semantics of "insiders-outsiders", tokens compatibility, metaphors of kinship, personal and possessive pronouns. In most cases category of "insiders-outsiders'' is expressed by lexemes with semantic of "insiders-outsiders", lexemes of compatibility, metaphors of kinship, personal and possessive pronouns. The opposition "insiders-outsiders'' has two main functions in the texts of educational discourse. The first function consists in presenting "insiders'' in the reader's mind as a group of people with special positive features. The second function consists in modeling of a positive image of the university using the positive image of its successful students, graduate students, alumni and staff.

DE urban environment; generation theory; creative class
AB The role of the environment in the age of late modernity is critically different from the modern. The area we inhabit is no longer just a part of the environment, but the structural element of the modern person's life. At the same time, not only the environment and the spatial aspect are different, our perception of these differ too and both have certain impact upon the changing environmental factor.
   It is feasible to use the "generation theory" in order explain both the direction and the contents of the change. According to the "generation theory", different generations have different values underlying their attitudes and behavior. At present time the most active generations are late representatives of the "baby boomers" (years of birth 1943-1963), so called "generation X" (1964-1983), and "generation Y" (1984-2003) that are becoming more and more prominent and active.
   Of the above, the generation X are most active in forming urban space around it and at the same time most active in consuming the urban space economically. The basic values of the generation X are mobility, freedom of choice, the capability of being globally informed, technical proficiency, individualism, readiness to change and to learn, eagerness to get new experience, pragmatism and self-sufficiency. For the generation X people the environment forms the basis of the habitat and constitutes the key factor of their choice.
   For the generation Y the environment plays even more profound role, since they are more mobile and share the attitude that everything, career, education and consumption might and hopefully will serve sources of fun and pleasure.
   The article is based upon two research project dedicated to the qualities and the quality of living in the city of Tomsk.

DE Representative bodies; institute; institution
AB Raises the question of the relevance of assigning the status of the "institute" or "institution" to the modern representative bodies of rural settlements in the framework of this paper is primarily due to the fact that the understanding of these two categories will make a conclusion about particular stage of social development of these bodies, society recognition degree as well as their role in society in general and in individual living. The author consistently examines concepts and feature of the "institute" and "institution". As a basic definition of "institution" D.P. Gavra's approach was selected. Considering the concept of "institution" the author refers to the O.V. Inshakova's definition. Considerable attention is paid to the analysis of "institution" features, based on the "institute" features. Considering to the representative bodies of rural settlements, the author notes that problems, associated with the operation of the local government system as a whole or at the level of municipalities, are more common in the scientific community today. Following authors were dealing with this problem: A.B. Abazov, A.E. Bulaev, I.A. Alekseev, A.A. Dzhigaryan, E.Y. Maikova and E.V. Simonova, J.O. Boger. The author comes to the conclusion that those characteristics, which are mentioned by modern scholars, are more typical for the "institution" category. Referring to the basic definition of the "institute" category, the author considers that in order to representative bodies of rural settlements be considered in terms of the "institute", it is necessary to speak not only about the legality, but also the legitimacy of bodies. The author suggests that mentioned features are related to communicative activities of the representative bodies of rural settlements. In turn, the legitimacy of representative bodies largely depends on the organization and implementation of their communicative activities within the framework of implementation powers in local government system. For this purpose, the author intends to continue research using sociological methods and tools that will make comprehensive conclusions about the perception of the representative bodies of rural settlements by different target groups , and thus to assess the legitimacy degree and ,as a result, institutional forms.

   communication and reputational field of organization
AB In recent years, more and more companies are turning their attention towards strategic management. This is primarily due to the fact that the situation is constantly changing in terms of factors of macro-and micro-environment of the company, and the management structure, based on strategic management is much easier and more efficient in aligning with new or changed circumstances.
   One way to manage the macro factors that influence organization development, is a holistic approach to communications and reputation field of the organization. In order to understand the specifics of communication and reputation field, it is necessary to consider its basic components.
   Communication field of organization is a multi-level, complex system of elements connected and ready to dynamic changes depending on the macro (or other) requirements of environmental stimulus. Communication field of organization is studied using communication audit, which involves a complete and systematic study of the organization communicative behavior, in order to identify the mechanisms of forming and the quality of communication links.
   Reputational field of organization - a kind of quilt, created on the basis of individual reputation elements or united disparate reputational factors, broadcasting different audiences and perceived them as part of the reputation of the organization questioned. One of study methods of it is reputational audit, involving assessment organization's reputation in terms of its objectives and strategies.
   After analyzing the basic components of communication and reputation field of the organization, we should note the integrated, interdisciplinary and multiparadigm nature of this concept, the basic functionality of which is broadcasting reputational factors via different communication channels, aimed at the target audiences. Communications and reputation management field of organization should be based on systematic monitoring of the communication organization field and identification of the dominant reputational factors, with the possibility of adjusting the basis of the overall organization strategy.

DE symbolic appropriation; social space; suburb; Irkutsk
AB The article explores the process of symbolic appropriation of suburb by settlers from the regional center of Eastern Siberia - Irkutsk. Author is examining symbolization of suburbs as one of the mechanisms of its isolation as a translocal space arising on border of the towns and villages.
   The author describes two basic practices of mapping appropriated space by new residents of suburban settlements. On the one hand - this is the inclusion of natural space in anthropogenic landscape through a geographic information system that creates a "drowing" of social space. On the other - it is the projection of the "drawing" in the physical space through the service GoogleMaps. The author concludes that the mapping "own" space becomes not only a tool for appropriating of suburb by new social group. Also, it is a mechanism destroying the monopoly of symbolic power of local governments over the space of the suburbs.
   The article describes the development of suburban architecture and space organization homestead of new suburban settlers. According to the author, these transformations of architectural landscape and functions of the house and outbuildings have become a symbol of the non-rural nature of new suburban space. At the same time preserving some agricultural functions of homestead becomes a symbol of exclusion suburb from urban space. Thus, the symbolics of private space in suburbs marks them as out-urban and out-rural space.
   Author considers a new character of trade and commercial advertising as the most striking symbol appropriation of suburb's business space. According to the author "urban" shops arising in the suburbs are becoming nodes of a new social space. Together with mass advertising, which is not characteristic of rural settlements, it becomes a symbol of exclusion suburb from traditional rural space. However, the orientation of advertising and trade not only for new residents but also for the indigenous rural population and transit traffic (including weekend outings) is the symbol of translocal nature of the new space.
   The author concludes that the character of examined symbolic space allows speaking about especial social space of suburbs. Such space closely linked with the urban and the rural societies both but existing quite independently.

AB The article analyses the views of the British Military responsible for the pacification of the Scotland Highlands in the first half of the XVIIIth century. The material deals with the representation, interpretation and use of ethnographic information about rebellious country in the process of its ethnic cartography. The article analyses the rhetoric strategies of the texts by the Military and their aims, role and consequences.
   The author studies the Highland Problem on the basis of data collected by Captain Edward (Edmund) Burt and Captain John Barlow in the Highlands of Scotland (taking into account the features of data accumulation process on this subject before and after the last Jacobite Rebellion 1745-1746). The author analyses this material according to the following guides: the evidence provided by most famous commentators on the Scotland Highlands state and on the Highland Problem in particular, the traditions of analyzing official and non-official documentary on the Highland Problem, the sense of active corporative unity that was spread among the militaries during the first half of the XVIIIth century and colonial issues and policies on other imperial margins.
   The author makes conclusion that the data collected and arranged by captains Burt and Barlow was not sufficient for their research results and rather represented the idea of ideal Highlands of Scotland which should be brought to life after strong social reorganization. Construction of ethnographic situations, invention of ethnographic traditions and search for the possible limits of knowledge about the Highlanders and the Highlands served to make empirical issues more concrete from the administrative point of view and up to the new level of colonial knowledge. In such circumstances ethnic cartography was used to integrate military and political geography and administrative ethnography of the Highland Problem solution.

DE science; social epistemology; the social; agent-structure approach;
   turns to the material
AB Philosophical reflection concerning studying of social measurement of science shows two main approaches. The first one is characterized by an ideal of "pure" knowledge free from any "extra epistemological" influence. The second approach recognizing the subjective bases of knowledge insists on sociocultural conditionality of all types of knowledge including the scientific one. Recognition of the fact that adequate comprehension of any thinking is impossible without identification of its sociocultural bases. It makes the main intention of a modern social epistemology. Thus conceptualization of "the social", "the culture" and "the cognitive" remains now one of the most complex and actual problems of this direction of investigation. Social epistemology traditionally comprises "social" factors as various forms of individual interaction and "social" factors as a wide social background (social structures, social institutions). As a result epistemological research concentrates on studying institutional or communicative aspects of the science."New" tendencies firstly show the intention to understand science not as a ready-made product (system of knowledge, social institute or communication form) but as a real process of scientific practice where the concept "social" indicates collective process of difficult coordination and mobilization of efforts, skills and the abilities necessary for receiving a reliable result. Secondly these tendencies are characterized by criticism of traditional oppositions subjective-objective, individual-collective, external-internal, ideal-material. The role of corporality and thingness considered to be equal participants of social interaction in modern investigations is suggested to be a special case. The problem of the research is to find a new interpretation of "the social" in agent-structure approach and "turn to the material" and to show that new interpretation is of great consequence for the development of the social epistemology. The first approach is connected with a problem of a search for the cause of such explanation of social reality: whether it is necessary to look for the similar basis in consciousness and will of subject or it is necessary to make a start from the structural relations. In this case actions of the subject can be ignored (put outside the brackets). The contemporary social theory turns to the agent-structure integration as the opposition between 'agent" and 'structure" has always been Achilles heel of the social science. "Turn to the material" represents same special debatable space of scientific research and technology in which the problem of materiality of the social world is raised. The author draws to the conclusion that the treatments offered by a modern social science "social" within the agent-structural approach and its turn to the material are heuristically valuable to the philosophical analysis of modern science. The agent-structural approach allows to carry out scientific analysis as practice in which communicative and institutional aspects form interconnected unity. Interest to material measurements characteristic of modern scientific research and technology provides conceptual and methodological resources for studying a current state of science which even more often is described by means of a neologism "Technoscience" understood not only as synthesis of applies and fundamental (natural-science and technical) researches but as unity of cognitive and material, intellectual and technical factors.

DE crisis communications; force majeure; tourism sector; PR; social media
AB In the XXI century tourism has become the most dynamic sector of international business, however during last time it faces serious difficulties: growth of number of natural and technogenic disasters, political and social force majeurs entails significant losses for the tourism sector enterprises. In such circumstances they face very difficult tasks: to prevent panic among tourists, to calm them, to keep their trust, provide real assistance and to fulfill their legal obligations. However, the vast majority of Russian tourism enterprises is not engaged in the solution of these tasks. Perhaps because it requires a special, different from daily, work with the target audiences, namely - the development and implementation of crisis communication program. Based on the hypothesis that the development of an optimal model of crisis communication in the tourism sector should be carried out taking into account, firstly, the specifics of tourism marketing, PR and advertising, and secondly, psychological and cultural features of perception and reaction of representatives of the different cultures in crisis situations, the author has developed such model, which is described in this article.
   The model consists of three major blocks of crisis communications, allocated on the basis of the time factor: before force majeure, at the time of beginning and during the force majeure; immediately after the force majeure. Each block is divided into parts according to the subject or the time of necessary actions.
   Work on the first phase, which is called "Before force majeure", should be conducted in six directions: the formation of a crisis team and resources, creation of a crisis plan, establishing and maintaining of contacts, work in social media, the overall image and reputation activity and monitoring.
   Upon the occurrence of force majeure work is divided on the basis of temporary factors: the necessary actions in the first 1.5 hours, 4-6 hours, 24 hours, and in the following days.
   After the end of force majeure crisis work in the company does not finish and conducts in four directions: public relations, advertising, promotion and BTL marketing.
   The article also presents the opportunities and prospects for the application of the developed model in the Russian tourist practice.

AB The paper is devoted to the study of social networks in terms of the various sociological researches according to the phenomenon of educational migration in the system of higher education. The author concludes that for the purposes of the paper the most suitable theory is the theory of social capital of P.Bourdieu. Based on the results of sociological researches we can also conclude that educational migrant is inevitably included in the different types of social networks (university, student, group etc.), but the degree of interaction between them depends on both the objective and subjective reasons; the degree of social capital is also different. Educational migrant is obliged to acquire social, cultural and symbolic capital for successful integration into the social sphere of the university, and adopt necessary social practices for successful socialization. Academic and social integration of educational migrant are related to each other, but the level of academic integration is not the key factor for the migrant's education. Internet networks also have a significant impact on the process of integration of educational migrant.

The response to the first decisions of the new regional authorities in the definition and implementation of innovation policy as contradictory.

AB The article considers the issue of impact of rural-to-urban migration of women on intergenerational relationships in rural families in post-Soviet Buryatia. The main attention of the researchers is focused on transnational migration of women to Russia however rural-to-urban migration of women also remains one of the main factors for family transformations in rural area of the country. The literature on the theme of women migration impact on the family is reviewed. Theory of intergenerational transfers is applied. There are two main forms of transfers: material (monetary, gifts, unpaid domestic labor) and non-material (emotional support). The older generation provides care for the children that were stayed behind by women migrated to the city. The wireless telephony widely distributed on the territory of the Republic of Buryatia became an important resource for intergenerational solidarity and support on a distance. Material transfers flows from the older generation to a younger one. Intergenerational support becomes especially important in the context of agrarian sector crises and deficit of institutionalized social support.

DE design; visual culture; hybrid media; digital landscapes; virtual
   environment
AB Virtual space is a dynamic part of modern life. Designers engaged in creation of digital landscapes form the visual representation of the virtual environment. Relevance of the research is determined by the necessity of analysis and generalisation of the current situation in the field of design in virtual worlds. What constitutes the digital visual landscapes in the aspect of hybrids media? What is the structure and specifics of design in interactive environment? The scientific novelty of the research consists in the unique analysis of digital landscapes from the standpoint of design in the aspect of new media, in which the influence of the virtual environment is shown on the formation of a new way of modern realities. Digital landscapes grow out of the digital environment, from new media, where there is convergence, hybridization of different data types, where there is an opportunity to interact with people or information. The most striking manifestations of designers' activities in the interactive environment are the development of user interfaces, web design and game design. Design in the interactive environment is, first of all, the solution of the following problem: willingness to meet the business, to meet the manager, to meet the client. Designers are communicators, people who find the points of conflict, the points of contact between the users and the interactive project. The designer, on the one hand, is able to demand the highest professional level from him/herself and from colleagues, on the other hand, she is able to bring the project to those points of effectiveness that are necessary for the customer, the company, for him/herself, for the successful implementation of the project. In order to realise the project in a digital form, the designer must be able to see the situation through the eyes of the artist, the user and the client in different sequences. Design in the interactive environment is an open creative thinking, working with visual material, with tools, simulation of interaction processes; rational critical analysis and selection of strategies that are effective; running the project and its continued support. The structure of the design process in the interactive environment varies from project to project and is determined by the objectives of the project, by the boundaries of the concept, time, budget, available tools and technologies. The specificity of the professional activity shifts towards designing the user interaction with digital landscapes. Hybrid media as a new communicative environment are relevant today in various areas of the socio-cultural, political and economic life: in production of goods and services, science, arts, entertainment. Every area of human endeavour consists of many elements, and in each case it is required to solve different problems with respect to inclusion of the project in the virtual life and its further development. Wide influence of the virtual environment on contemporary sociocultural ontology leads to the processes of design branching in the virtual environment into a set of directions, to the emergence of new design practices.

There is a growing increase in the role of the ethnic factor in the global cultural and historical process, which is reflected in the increased interest in their cultural identity, territorial and cultural integrity.
   Occurred disconnection of time and generations, loss of spiritual guidance in society forced to seek a way out of the crisis and the renewed interest in ethnic culture, national traditions. Way out of a situation in many respects seems to us to handle the people to its roots in the revival of ethnic consciousness, a change in the scale of internal assessments and value orientations.

AB The problem of disintegration of Social Federalist Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) has hitherto been studied mainly from the perspective of the federal centre - Belgrade. However the formation of modern Western Balkan states, which were the former Yugoslav republics, their history of independence, which has lasted for more than 20 years, indicates the need to look at the process from the point of view of these republics. In this article we propose some theoretical approaches to the problem of secession of the Republic of Croatia. Territorial integrity of Yugoslavia was highly dependent on Croatia as one of the most developed republics. But since 1945 Croatia was permanently dissatisfied with its status in SFRY and went for changing its status which is easy to notice through constitutional changes. Every new republican constitution gave to Croatia more political and economic independence. Moreover, the priority of republican borders was higher than that of national borders, which was the fundamental reason for a Serbo-Croatian war in 1990s. There were also political and economic reasons, such as unsuccessful reforms of the 1960s, coming to power in Croatia of a young more nationalist-oriented leadership, the defeat of supporters of a "strong" federation, growing influence of nationalist-oriented Croatian Diaspora abroad. On the public level the problem was indicated by growing of tensity in common relationships especially during the "Croatian spring" of 1970-1971, termination of the program of unification of the language, public declarations.

DE Theophan Prokopovich; Stefan Javorsky; Stone of Faith; A Hummer on the
   "Stone of Faith"; D.E. Jablonsky; Lutheran polemics; unification of
   churches
AB "A Hammer on the "Stone of Faith"" is an anonymous Russian Lutheran pamphlet written in about 1731 against the book The Stone of Faith by Metropolitan Stefan Javorsky (1728). The origin of this writing is still a mystery as well as the name of its author, an unknown Russian Lutheran. The research of recent years didn't make any attempt to reveal all the existing manuscript copies or this writing, to figure out its author, the time it was written and the consequences of its creation. To answer these numerous questions the archive researches were to be made in order to determine the most authentic copy of the writing. The second aim of the conducted research was to characterize the whole complex of social and political views of the author and polemical context the writing was created in. The Author of A Hammer on the "Stone of Faith stood as an absolute proponent of the Church reform of Peter the Great. From these positions he criticises conservatively oriented priesthood Stefan Yavorskv Metropolitan and his confederates. Ideological and stylistic similarity of the writing to Theophan Prokopovich-s "Church Orden" makes it possible to suppose that the author of both writings was Theophan, the Archbishop of Novgorod. The pamphlet was created with the aim to obtain the government prohibition of the Stone of Faith. However, "A Hammer on the-Stone of Faith" contains the traces of influence of a foreign -language writing. Theophan's relations trace back to Germany, to a wellknown Lutheran theologian D.E. Jablonsky, the author of the unpublished writing A Hammer of God's Word Breaking the Rock (near 1731). It appears that several pieces or this writing were used by Theophan in his pamphlet A Hammer on the "Stone or Faith".

AB It is widely accepted that a high level of scientific, technological and engineering development has become a source of national wealth. As a consequence, authorities in different countries are facing the issue of managing all the components of knowledge transfer. The aim of this study was to define an optimal long-term technological policy. This study performs a comparative analysis of traditions, history, as well as actual similarities and differences between technological polices in Germany and Russia. It is found that both countries experience similar difficulties in managing knowledge transfer. We suggest that creation of favorable tax conditions as a tool of successful technological policy should stimulate research and innovation. The results of our future work could be used in the decision making process at the governmental level.

DT Article
DE N.N. Golovin; World War I; source; sociology of war; political crisis;
   military science
AB According to general-lieutenant N.N. Golovin, an active participant in the Word War I, among the main reasons of Russia's unpreparedness for war the following should be named: faulty legislative support of warfare measures and of waging of the war, low professionalism of the state officials responsible for preparing the country for war, the government's moral incompetence in the crisis, absence of fully functional Joint Staff in the Russian Empire, deficient patriotic education in Russia, lack of will in the academia for creating and developing the study of the social phenomenon of war, non-compliance of the works on military history with high scientific standards. As his main treatises were written in emigration, he had no access to the main archive documents collections on the war, which definitely interfered with the objectivity of his conclusions. On the plus side, he draws on a wealth of reliable facts and extensive materials he himself amassed, uses data from both foreign and Soviet historiographies and strives to identify and solve the most fundamental issues that caused the Russia Empire to suffer defeat in the war. Making assessment of the source study potential of his works we have to concede that Golovin carries out a thorough and knowledgeable analysis of Russian and German Selective Service Acts, of conditions that hindered Russia in preparing and using its mobilization base to the utmost, of obvious and latent defects in the country's military establishment. He estimates the strength of the Russian army and personnel losses, describes the transport support and troubles with various combat supplies (artillery equipment, aviation, cars, rifles, ammunition, foodstuff, uniforms, etc.). He reports the changes in the mood of in the lines and in the rear-based units, the corruption and doom of the army in 1917-1918.

AB The article presents a prosopographical analysis of Catholic chaplains in the entourage of the Viscounts of Montague in the second half of the 16th - early 17th cc. The author also looks at their level of education and professional training and into their relationship with lay Catholics. It has been demonstrated that the chaplains chosen by the Viscounts of Montague and their relatives were well-educated, either a University, or a seminary graduates, and preached often. The position of Catholic clergy strengthened by the early 17th c., although clerics remained dependent on their patrons financially. The presence of clerics within Catholic households, close to their flock offered them a unique opportunity to influence laity, and often to define their religious practices, behaviour and political actions. Even in the absence of 'normal' parochial structure, in the context of missionary church, the idea emerged of a priest as a pastor and instructor, in accordance with the views of church reformers on the role and image of clergy. In this respect Catholic missionaries in England were more successful than priests in continental Europe.

DE Renaissance historiography; Renaissance studies in Spain; Spanish

AB The article is devoted to the history of Renaissance studies in Spain. Its aim is to outline the main stages of the development of this branch of knowledge in Spanish historical science and to define their characteristic features. Various sources of information, including the works of Russian, European and American researchers, were used in the analysis of the problem. The evolution of the studies is traced from the first references to the phenomenon of Renaissance in Spain in general works of the XIX century to the latest research papers dedicated to the detailed analysis of the epoch in Spanish culture (including some interdisciplinary works on the issue). The first problem raised in the article is the beginning of Renaissance studies in Europe and its further development as it was interpreted by Russian and European historians. The author presents a brief historiographic analysis of works on the Middle Ages, as the era which chronologically includes the Renaissance epoch, and the principal spheres of interest in those investigations. The author also examines the research concerning directly the phenomenon of Renaissance in Spanish culture and distinguishes three main generations of historians, in accordance with the recent Spanish studies. Special attention is paid to the fact that the first two generations of Spanish Renaissance historians generally focused on artistic aspects of Renaissance studies and mostly ignored the influence of the phenomenon on social, political and economical development of the country whereas in the latest studies there is a clear link between culture and historical evolution of the nation. Therefore though there is the abundance of works on the Renaissance art in general, just few research concern the historical aspect of the phenomenon. The author concludes that the phenomenon of Spanish Renaissance is an ambiguous and controversial issue in contemporary historical science and needs more detailed and thorough investigation.

DT Article
DE Source; World War I; source readers; historiography; archaeography;
   iconography
AB The article focuses on studying the main stages of the integration of archive documents on World War I (an event that determined the destiny of mankind in XX century) into current scholarship. Although arbitrary and somewhat perfunctory in the assessment of the causes of the war, its economic and political pre-conditions and outcomes, the role of foreign policy factors, Soviet historiography of World War I history retains its value. Unique papers on various issues connected with World War I were published as early as 1920s and 1930s. These studies continued in later decades. However, we have to concede that for some reasons archaeography of the last war led by the Russian Empire - i.e. the studies dealing with the principles of publication archive documents on the subject - remained for a long time overlooked by researchers. Contributions of the scientific magazine "Historical archive" are much appreciated. Editorial staff selecting documents (especially for anniversary issues) made an effort to introduce topics unprovided with sources. The author intends to present documents on the operations on fronts and situation in the rear, on the fates of commanders and privates, on internal and foreign policy of Tsarist, Temporary and Soviet governments. The publication and overview of the sources was not meant to create a stir, and yet many of the papers printed for the first time in "Historical archive" revealed unknown facts in biographies of military and state leaders and expanded the knowledge of the heroic and tragic events of World War I.

AB The author, using existing international legal base of the UN, carries out the analysis of a conceptual framework in the field of counteraction to terrorism. The author investigates the generic concept "political violence" in relation to the concept "International Terrorism" in article. It is noted that it belongs to the difficult political and legal phenomena which don't have the standard definition and universally coordinated set of system signs.
   There are no in-depth studies of this term in science of international law. Generally politological aspects were exposed to the analysis.
   Peculiar feature of category of political violence is the special structure of subjects of commission of violent acts: individuals (group of individuals). The international law doesn't recognize the state behavior as violence expression. According to international legal representations the states possess a monopoly on implementation of lawful violence within implementation of the powers of authority. The limited right to violence realization also admits universal scale behind the states.
   The analysis of international legal base in the sphere of fight against terrorism allows to allocate two standardly fixed signs of political violence: action against individuals and illegal nature of behavior.
   The circle of people which can suffer in connection with violence application is unreasonably limited in the international conventions. The international law classifies them only individuals left out of the legal regulation of other entities.
   The theory of political and legal science offered to allocate peculiar features of political violence, including a sign "efficiency". This sign doesn't possess constructive value for studied category as the result received as a result of violent behavior, as a rule, differs from the desirable. Efficiency has relative character.
   Motives and the purpose of violent behavior didn't fixing in international law. Recognizing that they don't play an important role at phenomenon identification as illegitimate violence, we will note that their character influences exact qualification of act in group of violent offenses. Identification of motive and the purpose of the violent act have essential value for definition of all circumstances of illegal violent behavior. It is possible to consider as the general target sign of all versions of political violence that all of them are hostilely aggressive to the outside world, are focused on infliction of harm.
   It is necessary to add the list of the acts falling under definition of the concept "violence" of international legal documents by not physical forms of behavior ( mental violence, threat of application of violence).

AB Political culture is viewed as a phenomenon of social reality. Attitudes toward it (its meaning or significance) are historically conditioned. This research studies enduring presuppositions about (dispositions toward) society and the state, and how these are reflected in conscious stereotypes and cognitive structures among young people within the socio cultural mechanisms that form and modify the basic characteristics of political culture. We are presents a methodological basis of the pedagogical process: the pedagogical purpose, the results achieved in practice and show the direction of the decision to extend. To attract work involved representatives of educational institutions, administrators, members of the Legislative Assembly of the Perm region and the Council of the Federation, the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly - the parliament of the Russian Federation. Educational activity in this area may be interested in the humanities teachers and organizers of educational work. The empirical basis of this research was conducted in 2012-2013 among upper secondary and college students in Perm. Sample size = 1800 persons.

DE Mengjiang; Inner Mongolia; civil service; public authority; regulation;
   legal regulation
AB The article describes the Institute of Public Service of the State Mengjiang which in the 1930s and 1940s claimed to leadership in the world of Mongolian peoples. The article discloses institutional framework of public service, procedures for filling positions, the basic requirements, rights and obligations applicable to public servants, measures of rewards and punishments. The problems related to the legal regulation of the civil service, the role and place of the Japanese side in the organization of the civil service. Mengjiang was formed with the participation of the Kwantung Army Command and considered by Japan as a springboard for an attack on the USSR. The state apparatus was formed. It included the public authorities at the national level and the level of administrative and territorial units, which formed the basis of Mengjiang. This political establishment's phenomenon is poorly studied in the scientific literature. Nevertheless, the highest public office became the subject of separate research works, as opposed to the issues of civil service. This article fills in this gap. On the basis of published documents (regulations, statistical and accounting data, reports, memoirs of participants of events, as well as data obtained by modern researchers) it became possible to manage building a detailed picture of the appointment to public office and the implementation of their duties. On the question of the formation of the state apparatus as on the top-level and at the average positions, the occupying forces' approach was careful. Despite the lack of a single legal act regulating this field of public relations, local acts that were taken at different times in the form of regulations, decrees and other documents regulated most aspects in great detail. The status of civil servant gave a number of privileges and guarantees, but officials were not equal to it - the priority was given to the Japan natives. Sectoral regulation of certain issues was actively practiced, including the requirements for the candidate, the promotion etc. In August 1945, the majority of public servants have lost their jobs and privileges, some have been prosecuted for their cooperation with the Japanese invaders, and the state apparatus, as does Mengjiang, was eliminated.

   synergetrics; controlled chaos; legal entropy; legal negentropy; world
   order
AB The relevance of the topic is determined by the necessity in realizing current changes in legal science. The essence of the changes is explained by the fact that our perception of reality is based on different scientific paradigms. The world is represented as a place full of contradictions and disorder, and we are looking for a framework that will fill it with sense. Many researchers are widely using concepts and methods of synergetrics, which is usually referred to as the theory of chaos in American scientific literature. Synergetrics helps to study a certain aspect, connection of a legal phenomenon. Therefore, this approach can be applied not in any research, but only in those requiring studying certain aspects and features of a phenomenon. The synergetic paradigm allows revealing such new characteristics of legal systems as: openness, self-organization, nonlinearity in the development of social and legal phenomena. At the time when the harmonization of the Russian and international legal systems is a priority, the transformations in the sphere of international relations are being taken into account. The knowledge of legal entropy will give a chance not only to explain many features of self-organization, disorganization and self-government of legal systems, but to develop the approaches, techniques allowing influencing the choice of the alternative ways of their development. Laws of the chaos theory can help while studying the dynamics of the modern civilization processes. At the same time, the complexity of the environment means a number of factors, influencing the work of various social organisms. This complexity also includes variability of these factors. Nowadays, hardly any country does not depend on the global informational, financial, economic, technological systems. A similar situation influences economy, political decisions and the system of legal regulation. At the same time there is an issue with the legitimacy of applying characteristics disorder, uncertainty, disorganization to the law, which, as a tool, provides the balance in social relations, adding essential certainty. This question is quite legitimate since there is no current solution in the modern legal science.

AB In 1930-31 in the USSR turned the case of the all-Union military officer counterrevolutionary organization "Spring" directed against former officers in the Red army. Despite a number of publications, this case remains practically unexplored. The materials are stored in Departmental archives of the security service of Ukraine. There were many bright individuals arrested as part of the "Spring". Protocols of their interrogations contain valuable materials on military-political history of our country. An article on the basis of the archival data is introducing for the first time into scientific circulation the investigation materials of the outstanding Russian military scientist and theorist, A. A. Svechin, arrested on the case of "Spring" in 1931-1932. All the evidences by Svechin are fully published for the first time. They concern the events of the Russian Civil war, history of Russian army, the life of former officers in the Soviet Russia and the USSR, the relations in the circle of former General Staff officers. The logic of the investigation and tactics of the detainee is analyzed and the conclusions on the peculiarities of political repressions of that period from the Svechin case are made. Publication of the materials of Svechin case gives an opportunity to fill a gap in the biography of an outstanding Russian military leader, his testimony contains interesting data about the relationship in the circle of former officers remaining in the USSR. The investigation materials are quite typical and similar in the other cases of former officers. The file is opened by an objective evidence relating to the epoch of the revolution and the Civil war and the 1920s and to the relationship of the "former". Then they are followed by self-incriminating testimonies, where Svechin repents of belonging to an organized counter-revolutionary underground. Further, it contains testimonies on his comrades, who were accused of the same offences. But there is no documentary evidence of counter-revolutionary manifestations. The materials of the case "Spring" testify to one of the stages of "crackdown" by the Soviet leadership, committed to the establishment of large industrial power and eliminating any manifestations of dissent.

AB The research into the problems of development of the youth as a specific social group that has special needs in socio-cultural terms attracts researchers' attention in different branches of science (psychology, pedagogy, economy, sociology, etc.). This interest is caused by the fact that the youth stage (especially early youth) involves formation of special world perception, understanding of socio-legal, political, and cultural events in the state, which becomes a basis for the development of a full-scale picture of the world at the later stages of maturation. Understanding the mechanisms to initiate young people to socio-cultural values is an important aspect of the strategic plans elaboration in order to develop the country and the region.
   The article is devoted to the study of social and cultural characteristics of young generation in the foreign and domestic science. It shows that each stage of the youth problems study was characterized by different research methods and tools. The image of the youth in modern Russia also has a number of features, presented in the article.
   The socio-cultural values of young people in the senior school age are identified in the "pilot" survey with the elements of formal interviews conducted among children attending the Research-and-Educational Center at ISEDT RAS. The article discloses further prospects of this research.

DT Article
DE Soviet Union; regional policy; political struggle; non-black earth;
   virgin soil; mental geography
AB Having put forward in the first half of the 1970s the initiative to support Non-Black Earth, former Virgin Soil activists L. Brezhnev and M. Solomentsev tried not to stress controversy between the two regional and economic strategies. Yet before perestroika Russian creative intelligentsia began to express its discontent with the treatment of Central Russia as the second Virgin Soil, demonstrating the archetypal perception of the center and periphery of the country. The Non-Black Earth program failed to compete with all-union and industrial programs, including those implemented on the Russian territory. The system however didn't exclude direct contacts between regional leaders and the "first person" in the state. Supervising agriculture since the end of the 1970s, M. Gorbachev as a representative of the Russian South didn't initially understand the significance of Non-Black Earth. At the beginning of the 1980s Brezhnev declared, that it was high time for national republics to help Russia. In the second half of the 1980s Non-Black Earth received resources previously assigned for the turn of northern rivers a project with anti-Russian reputation. Under the conditions of economic crisis works in the Non-Black Earth region were stopped. After the collapse of the USSR the discussion on alternatives of regional development during the Soviet period assumed a special acuteness. New memoirs and archival materials enabled better understanding of the decision-making in post-war Soviet Union. The author traces the way from the local reforms' experience to macro-regional programs and setting tasks in all-union scale. A difficult choice of regional priorities intertwined with the struggle for power and determining the model of development, competition between union republics and various Russian regions, inter-agency rivalry, opposition between bureaucracy and public opinion with the influence of certain public moods on the officials. A choice between investments into the Russian Non-Black Earth or Virgin Soil regions was discussed during the entire post-war period. Emphasizing the priority importance of Virgin Soil's plowing, Khrushchev by no means ignored the agricultural problems of Non-Black Earth: he kept in mind the order of priorities with limited resources. The resistance to the strategy of raising Virgin Soil was firmly linked to the activity of the so-called anti-party group. This stereotype didn't lose its topicality after Khrushchev's dismissal.

On the basis of the analysis of statistical data and normative acts of the Government and Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, the key global and national trends in higher education are identified: increasing demand for higher education, resulted in its considerable offer (the growth of quantitative indicators is not always accompanied by improvement of higher education quality); reduction in the total number of students due to the demographic situation worsening; transition to a multi-level system of higher education under the Bologna process; change in specialties patterns and directions of training specialists with higher professional education due to the economy structural reforms and labor market needs; aggravation of competition. The tendencies lead to the emergence of demographic, political and economic risks. To reduce negative impact of the external risks to the universities' activity it is necessary to develop corresponding state educational policy in the sphere of higher education and risk management in universities.

DE region; trust; institutional trust; distrust culture; modernization
AB The purpose of this article is to analyze theoretical approaches to the concept of social trust, to assess the level of confidence, to show its role in the modernization and development of the region. According to the author, trust is a set of socially responsible and socially confirmed expectations of individuals in relation to other individuals, organizations, institutions, rules and regulations that constitute the fundamental content of life and support sustainability and cohesion of society. Based on the popular typology of trust proposed by Anthony Giddens, the author analyzes the state of institutional trust in the Vologda Oblast. Using the data of the public opinion monitoring carried out by ISEDT RAS, the article analyzes the Vologda Oblast residents' trust in major political institutions. The author identifies factors that generate trust, studies the composition of the groups of people according to trust, and shows the effects of a low level of institutional trust. They are manifested in the lower level of social activity and in the fact that the people are not ready to unite and interact with each other. Besides, the author points out that civil society is atomized. The article also raises the problem of low efficiency of the structures of civil society, despite the fact that there is a significant amount of NCOs in the region, according to the statistics. Based on the data of ISEDT RAS polls, the article points out an extremely low assessment of performance of NCOs, a low involvement of citizens in their activities and a low level of awareness concerning the existence and activities of these organizations. The author notes that the development of the region, and implementation of effective modernization on its territory require not only assessment of available social resources and, first of all, social capital, the main indicator of which is the trust, but also the development of targeted policy to increase the level of trust in the regional community, to overcome the factors that generate and support a culture of distrust.

LA Russian

DE throne; patronal place; enthronement; golden throne; golden tent; center

AB The author of this article seeks to identify the historical origins of particular patronal place characteristic for the ulus of Jochi and later Turko-Tatar States established on its territory in the 15th-16th centuries. This patronal place was known as the "golden throne" and has been recorded by the Turko-Tatar (epics, chronicles, historical works) and some Russian sources. An overview of historical sources reveals that according to the Turko-Tatar traditions of the 16th-18th centuries, the "golden throne" was a place, where the ruler (Khan, king) was sitting in the Golden Horde and at the post-Horde political space. The author of this article emphasizes the important fact: in historical sources the "golden throne" was always associated with the place of enthronement of the Tatar ruler. As a result of detailed analysis of the available historical material, the author found that the often mentioned "golden throne" existed not only in the ulus of Jochi, but throughout the Mongol Empire. Moreover, further analysis of the available historical material (including a comparison with information contained in the parallel Persian, Chinese, and Latin sources) showed that the "golden throne" was connected to another symbol of power, common in all Chinggisid States and recorded by a number of historical sources, that is, with special tent (yurt) known as the "Great Golden horde". This tent together with the throne seat symbolized the focus of the khan authority in the Mongol Empire and the subsequent Chinggisid States.

DT Article
DE Source; parish schools; popular education; pupils; teaching staff;
   priests; the Upper Volga region
AB The paper focuses on the development of popular education in the late 19th century. Upper Volga region, namely, on the rise and peculiarities of parish school activities. The term the Upper Volga region includes the territories of the Tver, Yaroslavl, Kostroma and Vladimir provinces. In the late 1870s, due to the reinforcement of the "Narodnaya Volya" terrorism as well as the aggravation of Russia social-political situation, the authorities decided to turn to the Russian Orthodox Church for help in organizing elementary educational institutions of a new type. In 1884 the name "parish schools" was allotted to these establishments. A special role in the process of organizing such schools belongs to K.P. Pobedonostsev, Ober-procurator of the Most Sanctified Synod. Negative attitude to parish schools on the part of some local governments, liberal-minded Zemstvos (People's Assemblies) in particular, is noted. A great number of People's Assemblies' members looked upon parish schools as obstacles on the way of progressive society development. Between 1881-1894 the number of parish schools rose to become 31835 with 981076 learners on the whole. Traditionally, such schools were opened by the parish priest's initiative and by parishers, they were financed with budget money, more than 20% of the temple takings, etc. The teaching staff included the parish priest and a specially hired teacher, male or female, who had a professional education. Lessons were conducted in the priest's house as few schools had their own class-rooms. The school year lasted from November through May and made one year (one-class schools) or two years (two-class schools). Having analysed the arrays of statements concerning the condition of the Upper Volga region parish schools, which are stored in state archives of the territories in question and their branches, the author has built a model of the average statistical parish school of the late 19th century Upper Volga region: a rural school organized by a local priest who, together with his wife, is engaged in teaching 20-30 peasant children from the nearby settlements, with boys being the majority of pupils.

DE Roman law; Christianity; West European legal consciousness; civilization
   identity
AB In this article the Author studies the fundamental components of the European legal y social consciousness, which formed the European identity and civilization in the Middle Ages. The object of the research is the legal sphere of the social consciousness from the point of view of legal psychology, history of law, theory of law and from the point of view of the social sciences and humanities. Therefore, the Author applies some interdisciplinary methods. The studied components of the legal consciousness in the research are the law and religion.
   In this article the Author investigates the concept legal consciousness in connection with the concepts of the "mentality", "identity" and "culture". The legal consciousness is defined by the Author as a legal concept of surrounding reality, determination of one's place in the structure of the world, perceived through the standard as the space of due and eventual behavior, the aggregate of legal stereotypes and myths about the good, evil and justice as well as about the state, the law, through the "try-on" all of these standards, restrictions and rules and consent or non-agreement to exist in the appropriate boundaries.
   In the Author's view, certain social myth reflecting the dogma of law must inevitably act as the core of public legal consciousness. This fact makes it difficult to study the phenomenon of legal consciousness since the myth is hard to fit into the system of scientific knowledge. The Author considers that the legal consciousness is a process as well as the result. It is a legal picture of the world which is not an objective reflection of the legal reality, but rather its perception on the basis of the fundamental social myth, which lies in its basis.

AB Education is a result of previous epoch experience but challenges of XXI century demand new approaches. The new epoch of civilization life connects with modernization. The new technical and technology era changes as social as soon as private life of human being. German sociologist Ulrich Beck called contemporary society Risk society. The existence of it determine by the possibility of answer to different challengers: political, economy, ecology, social et cetera. New technologies demand new and new areas of knowledge. The situation with knowledge is transforming very fast. For example, 90 % of scientists are our contemporaries and they produced 90 % of science information in the World. Rapid grow of science information lead to situation when necessary information for effective action can be neither obtained, understood no used especially in crisis circumstances. We call this condition as cognitive barrier or cognitive limit. So we need new education technology to change the situation.

LA Russian
DT Editorial Material
DE science; infrastructure; science funds; scientific ranking; scientific
   journals; peer review; open access
AB Today philosophy is not particularly concerned with philosophical problems but with ones of its social existence. Is this a sign of our times? Apparently it is, for "the eternal question" whether the philosophy is science has been decisively solved today. Philosophy is the complete science taken as a social institution, no more an amateurish enterprise; in its current social status it does not differ from general linguistics, theoretical sociology, civil history, pure mathematics. Philosophy has to justify its topicality, theoretical relevance, necessity for certain theoretical innovations in the context of modern scientific problems. At the same time philosophy has to establish its practical relevance, i.e., the applicability to meet the socio-political, economic, cultural and information needs. Its ability for this is doubtful for officials and laymen, but is important for philosophy as ever. It appears that it is here to look for specifics of modern philosophy: it is located within the common destiny with modern science, culture as a whole.
   The ongoing science reform has set the philosophers (and other scientists) to the new realities, and they develop the necessary mechanisms of adaptation. There is nothing wrong with improving the Russian Science Index (RINZ) to the international level, in creating new systems of indexing and the inclusion of at least parts of them in a global database. The same is for establishing new science foundations and other sources to support science. The promoting of Russian scientific journals will be also a step in the right direction. But it should not be forgotten: the scientific infrastructure must grow slowly, in communication with scientists and not be born like Athena from the head of Zeus. For this to work, one needs not just to subordinate a recalcitrant population Universe of knowledge to one's political will. The involving in infrastructure transformation must be a social program for living people with their passion for scientific research authors, grantees, future leaders of ratings, motivated scientists. Otherwise, there will only a bureaucratic infrastructure dropped from the top without any human agent.

Recorded in the historical past, this testimony is interpreted by Santner as a "signifying stress", as a challenge that forces us to make a decision on the new forms of social existence.

DT Article
DE "Thaw period"; Marxism-Leninism; students; social science; nonconformity
AB The article is devoted to the teaching of Marxism-Leninism in higher educational institutions of the Soviet Union during the Khrushchev decade. Since this discipline was extremely politicized, Stalin's death and the changes in soviet leadership immediately affected its content. The article analyzes the changes in the teaching of the so-called "Social sciences" and their correlation with the political events in the USSR and in the world. A separate part of the article talks about how historical facts were used by teachers to explain current events that needed to be justified (for example, the exclusions of G. M. Malenkov, L. M. Kaganovich and V. M. Molotov, the use of troops in suppressing protests in Hungary, the removal of Khrushchev from all leadership positions, etc.). The article also pays attention to the place of Marxism-Leninism in the curriculum, students' academic workloads, and the ratio of academic hours allocated to "social sciences" and profile subjects. Students' attitudes toward the subject are also important. The article analyses the situation in the Arts and Humanities Schools, where Marxism-Leninism was perhaps the main subject, and Faculties of Sciences, where it was an extra but mandatory load. The author provides various manifestations of student protest against the "social sciences", identifies its causes and considers the measures that the KPSS, Komsomol, and university leadership took to deal with it. The article is based on regulatory documents, methodological recommendations for teachers, and transcripts of party and Komsomol discussions about this problem.

AB In article relationship of Russian Orthodox Church and Catholic in 1980 - the 1990th years is considered. Dialogue development between them had not only internal political, but also foreign policy value. One of the most painful questions in relationship of Russian Orthodox Church and the question of the uniatsky church earlier existing in the territory of Ukraine and Belarus and restored in the second half of the 1980th years was Catholic. Divergences in a number of theological questions remained. In particular, it belonged to the doctrine confirmed with the Second Vatican Cathedral about Papal infallibility and a primacy of the Roman High priest. Peacekeeping activity was that sphere where the Russian Orthodox and Catholic churches most successfully cooperated though rivalry was present and here.

AB Approaching anniversary of the World War I activates research interest to it's history. Actual scientific objectives are detailing of participation in hostilities of individual military units, an objective assessment of the impact of war on the ordinary life of the country, a reflection of the individual's role in the military-political events. Special importance in this situation is the problem of detecting and using documents at the disposal of the federal and regional archives. Perspective direction of research is the localization of military history. The impact of events of the World War I to the fate of residents of a particular region is quite possible to trace with the involvement of archival documents. Kursk province from July 1914 was included in the organizational-mobilization events and socio-economic realities of war, because it was typical agricultural region of central Russia with a predominance of manufacturing industry. History of Kursk province in beginning of 20th century is reflected in dissertations, monographs and scientific publications of local historians L.A. Kuznetsova, I.V. Sahnevich, E.S. Kravtsova, F.A. Gavrikova and others. But the socio-economic development of the province during the World War I until present time did not become the subject of special study. The purpose of our research is the analysis of the composition and content of the source base, reflecting the characteristics of the socio-economic life of Kursk province in 1914-1918. Methodological basis of the research amounted source-based and comparative-historical methods, which revealed the information capabilities of various historical sources and analyze their content. As a result, found that main bulk of documents with specified issues is contained in more than 25 funds of state archive of Kursk region. Information about the participation of the population of the province in strengthening of the army may be substantially supplemented by dint of the data of the Russian State Military Historical Archive. Documents detected in the funds these archives reflect the multifaceted activities of the central and local authorities, as well as the population of Kursk province to ensure the country's defense and solving everyday economic problems during the war. Study of the content archival funds points to new opportunities by historical research, because this content has not been used previously, and sets the direction to further develop of theme about participation in the events 1914-1918 years of population of the Russian regions.

AB Ukraine is now in deep crisis - on the verge of default, not having enough internal resources for development. Based on analysis of reform history for more than 20 years the author emphasizes the main causes of current situation: inherited structural disbalances in the national economy, absence of clear reform strategy and serious drawbacks in economic policy, superficial reforms by IMF recipes on the initial stage - the priority of financial stabilization at any price to the prejudice of real sector, sharp re-orientation of external economic relations, overestimation of economic advantages of European integration path, reduction of cooperation ties with Russia by political reasons. These have led to degradation of basic industries, conservation of technological backwardness, deficit of internal resources for modernization, chronic external indebtedness and high dependence on imports, - all this make national economy very vulnerable to external shocks in the times of global crises.

AB A significant cultural shift in the global community is reflected in a dramatic form in the cultural processes for over the last 30 years. This paper will analyze the focus of modern fascism (neo-fascism) on the atomization of national cultures, disintegration of international community, legitimacy of racial nationalism and other aspects which significantly actualize further studies of the given phenomena. We consider the problem through the prism of "cultural images" of fascism and the principles of its formation, applying the scientific set of tools used in the philosophy of culture, political science and philology. It will bring us ever closer to being able to regard fascism as a destructive phenomenon of the present times.

DT Article
DE diversity management; primary school; discrimination; morals; social
   order; cohesion
AB This study analyzes the contexts employed in the category "people" (narod) in Soviet and post-Soviet primary school textbooks. The empirical base of the research was three textbooks from the 1970-80's and 12 textbooks from 2001-2006. This allowed an analysis of how often the concept "people" was used in a variety of contexts and meanings. In Soviet textbooks, ideas such as "working people" and "co-citizenship" were dominant,, whereas the Post-Soviet textbooks focused on the "ethno-cultural community". Ethnic groups' are mentioned in the Soviet textbooks only within the context of natural-climatic zones, with an emphasis on economic specialization as the "traditional" type of production. In the post-Soviet textbooks, "ethnic groups" are mentioned within civil and historical contexts. This includes the possibility and necessity of definite ethnic identification at the level of the individual. The criteria for this are language, folklore, anthropological characteristics and mental outlook. Confirmation of the homogeneity of the group based on these criteria leads to the approval of the homogeneity of the nation. The nation as a political community is conceived in modern textbooks as a developed, evolved form of the ethnic community. Such contexts are fixed through the approval of morality of the social order, which leads to the strengthening of social hierarchy and to the spread of discriminatory practices against minorities.

AB The article attempts to reconstruct the life journey of one of the most prominent functionaries of the "Union of Soviet Atheists" M.V. Galkin (1885-1948). He was the author of the working draft of the decree on the separation of church and state and school, published in December 1917 within the pages of the party semi-official newspaper 'Pravda'. Being employed as a full-time "expert" of VIII "Church") department of the People's Commissariat of Justice, Galkin (member of the Bolshevik Party since 1919) took a distinct position of militant atheism. He was among the most active participants in the campaign of the opening of graves with the remains of Orthodox Saints (1919-1920s) and of the confiscation of church values from churches and monasteries (1921-1922s). The State Political Directorate engaged Galkin in the preparation and organization of the split in the Orthodox Church. The authorities made extensive use of pre-revolutionary publishing experience of Galkin when editing antireligious periodicals: magazines 'Revolyutsiya I Tserkov' ("Revolution and the Church"), 'Nauka I Religiya' ("Science and Religion"), 'Bezbozhnik' ("Atheist"). Until 1926 Galkin was a member of management of the so-called "atheistic" movement. But after the conflict with Em. Yaroslavsky he lost all his administrative posts (at the national level) and all his political clout (in the governing party and government circles). Under these conditions, Galkin decided to shift his permanent residence for Ukraine. His residency away from the capital seems to be so invisibly that Moscow and Leningrad.ntireligionists wrongly believed that the life of the former priest passed away, aged 45. In 1930 he supposedly went to Ukraine to give a set of atheistic lectures and disappeared there under mysterious circumstances without a trace.

AB The article deals with the historian A. V. Florovsky's (1884-1968) scientific reserch, the analisys of his autographs that are in custody in the RAS Archive. Many of the scientist's articles and monographs written in emigration are not familiar to the russian scientists. National libraries did not receive any of his works from 1922 to 1945. Nowdays there are a number of his authograps preserved at the scientist's personal fund at the Archive of RAS, that has never been a subject of the scientific research before. The objectivies of the article is the study of the evolutional changes in the scientist's bibliographic and thematic approaches to the study that took place during his life abroad as well as the evaluation of his autographs. In 1920s A. V. Florovsky studied the history of Ancient Russia and Catherine's Legislative Commission. His research were based on the materials that he brought with him from Russia. He explores specific historical subjects and makes large-scale scientific conclusions. More than half of these studies are published in the foreign journals. Since the second half of the 1920s to the 1940s the focus of Florovsky were political and cultural issues of the Russian-Czech relations. Florovsky's researches were based on extensive archival sources. Least known Florovsky's research about the religious component of the Czech-Russian contacts. Most Florovsky's articles, fragments and drafts on this topic never been published and so their publication is the most important task. In the late 1940s he began to study Russian-Austrian relations. Florovsky retained professional contacts with Soviet scientific institutes and libraries, and that is why he was able to maintain a high scientific level of their research. Several articles have been published in the USSR. Florovsky created several historiographical reviews and articles, written in the genre of historical portrait. All works written in emigration, present in Russia in a small number of copies. Today the Florovsky's works on religious themes is the most important for research and publication in Russia.

AB Foreign policy uses a wide range of soft power policy instruments and models. It is thus useful to identify the best practices, key tools and approaches that ensure the sustainability and coherence of policy, as well as the connecting elements that allow a country to coordinate its foreign policy actions.
   This article analyzes the experience of China, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and the European Union in five areas: the promotion of language and culture; cooperation in the fields of education, science and technology; business relations; public diplomacy; and official development cooperation.
   The article is based on the expert survey conducted by National Research University Higher School of Economics in December 2013. The sample includes experts of the international relations engaged in Russian foreign affairs, as well as development cooperation. The results of the expert survey allowed to identify the tools ensuring the most impact and best application of soft power in various socioeconomic and political conditions.
   The identified tools are structured into a system of interconnected organizational forms with five areas or clusters of influence. Key institutions acting in the five areas constitute the centres of sustainability of the respective clusters.

AB Turning to the analysis of the "democracy" notion, the author notes that the widely spread understanding of the democratic arrangement presuming such elements of a political system as periodical change of political leadership by means of free elections and securing broadest individual rights as well as minorities' rights within a national state, is far from always corresponding to the substantial meaning of the said notion. In the context of such an approach it is the concepts of electiveness, suffrage, nation-state etc., that become the subject of the author's attention. The objective of the article is to initiate a discussion of the problematic zones and of the "tension points" of democracy, often to be found at the periphery of the political science discourse.

   in terms of loyalty; deprofessionalisation of lawmaking
AB The article is an attempt to analyze the transformations in the relations between the state and society in modern Russia. It analyzes public reaction to five high-profile changes in Russian legislation between 2012-2013, toughened sanctions for the involvement in public events, introduction of the concept of noncommercial organization a foreign agent, freedom of discussion limitation, in mass media and the Internet, a wider interpretation of the concept of banned political activity. The amendments to the legislation have become the response to an extremely high public activity since the 2011-2012 winter. Each of the laws in question was the subject matter of heated criticism in society and its application got actually blocked. Public examination confirmed common disadvantages relating to both the content of law (substitution of its subject matter with legislative objectives) and the procedure of its discussion affected by the violation of laws and principles of legislative process. The laws were adopted for a special purpose, i.e. ad hoc. This circumstance makes all the five acts dubious in terms of constitution and causing violations against the constitutional rights of citizens. Besides, they contradict international obligations taken by Russia. The acts in question are typical of legal uncertainty (ambiguity in presenting normative content). Finally, all the acts analyzed violate the consistency in Russian legislation. The public response to this irrelevant regulation was intentional public disobedience. In this regard, the analysis of the causes in the situation is of special importance which is embedded in the process of election and counting votes. Negative selection is applied when making up the body of the parliament, people included in it as the representatives in parliament depends on the degree of loyalty of their majority to President and the executive power. This is the cause of deprofessionalisation of lawmaking in the Russian Parliament and a lower level in its competency and thus a similar attitude to its activity by society.

DT Article
AB The article bridges the traditional differentiation between "overseas" and "contiguous" (landmass) empires by focusing on the typical "continental" imperial policies of the English and then British government toward the Highland region of Scotland. The author argues that many "overseas" British imperial practices were developed in the late seventeenth century through the first half of the eighteenth century in Scotland, under the direct influence of the continental political culture of Cameralism. Thus, an important instrument used toward solving the "Highland problem" (understood as the pacification and modernization of the region) was "political arithmetic": elementary population statistics, a precursor to political economy. The author characterizes the entanglement of academic practices with pragmatics of imperial governance and colonization as conscious social engineering. This early instance of social engineering helps in understanding many aspects of British imperial policies and latter-day attempts at social engineering as part of overseas colonialism.

DT Article
DE Ancient Rus; Sergiy Radonezhsky; Battle of Kulikovo; monastery reform;
   Trinity cult
AB The article analyzes the ideological and religious originality of Sergiy Radonezhsky and the impact of his activity on social and political life of Russia at the end of the 14th century. Radonezhsky's involvement in monastery reform, as well as his role in the introduction of the cult of Trinity, a novelty cult for Russia, are scrutinized in detail. The paper shows that these measures were in fact carried out consciously by the Trinity father superior who had in mind the consolidation of the Russian nation in anticipation of the upcoming events to overthrow the foreign subjugation. The two main periods of Radonezhsky's church and public service are explored in the article: 1) Sergiy's participation in social and political life as a representative of the "national" church party and 2) his acceptance of spiritual leadership amidst the difficulties of the Church crisis caused by the struggle for the vacant chair of the primate after the death of Metropolitan Alexius. Also mentioned are the arguments that allow Sergiy to be hailed as the spiritual leader of the nation on the eve of the Battle of Kulikovo. It is concluded that Sergiy's contemporaries deservedly distinguished him as a significant figure of the epoch of change, and the skepticism present in some historiographical works lacks solid foundation. It was Sergiy Radonezhsky who most audibly expressed the aspirations of the Russian spirit, when destruction, savagery and shock caused by foreign enthrallment, were replaced by the gathering of forces, marching hand in hand with the processes of centralization.

DT Review
DE Golden Horde; A.N. Kurat; khans' yarlyks; Ottoman Empire; Ulugh
   Muhammad; Aksak Timur; Tokhtamysh-Khan
AB The article examines main works of the famous Turkish historian A.N. Kurat, his views and assessments of the Golden Horde history. It is known that A.N. Kurat introduced into scholarly circulation yarlyks-letters of the Golden Horde khans, which he found in the archives of the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. A number of his works and articles are devoted to the Golden Horde and its rulers. The article discusses the works of A.N. Kurat that are dedicated to the Golden Horde, as well as his main ideas, sources of the author. The works of A.N. Kurat still have not lost their significance. His works on the Golden Horde topics are mainly devoted to the source study, his reconstruction of events is based on primary sources of the Golden Horde origin. Kurat also noted the special importance of his own sources. In his works, he explored the following three Golden Horde documents: Bitik of Ulugh Muhammad Murad II, letter of Mahmud Khan bin Muhammad Khan bin Timur Khan to Fatih Sultan Mehmed, and letter of Ahmad Khan ibn Muhammad ibn Timur Khan to Fatih Sultan Mehmed. Kurat studied yarlyks and bitiks at a high scholarly level of source studies. They still are the basis for the study of the Golden Horde documents. Thanks to the good knowledge of the Ottoman, Russian, European sources, and historiography A.N. Kurat analyzed in detail the political situation in the Golden Horde; especially valuable are his works on the 15th century. His works on the period of Ulug Muhammad are still among the most important works devoted to this outstanding personage of the late Golden Horde. In his works Kurat asked himself: why the Golden Horde disintegrated? In search of answers to this question he put to the first place the confrontation between Tokhtamysh Khan and Timur Aksak. His conclusions about relationship between the Golden Horde and the Ottoman Empire are confirmed by the latest works on this topic.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE consolidation of society; social development; sociology; social
   perception; trust; social well-being
AB Transformation processes in the modern globalizing world cover all spheres of society, causing serious qualitative and quantitative changes in its structure. The role of society in the process of globalization is becoming increasingly important, that is why the consolidation of its members becomes the most important direction of social development.
   The authors consider the problem of consolidation of the Russian society, they substantiate the importance of the subjective factor in social development, which consists in the people's perception of key events in the political, economic, and social life.
   The analysis of official statistical data shows that there are certain positive trends in the dynamics of the most representative indicators of social health, which reflects the degree of psychological adaptation of the population to their living conditions. However, having calculated the latent level of some of them (suicide), the authors identify that there is inaccuracy in the records of these indicators, which proves that there are flaws in the state system of collection of statistical information. It highlights the relevance of sociological research for a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of current social processes and phenomena.
   The article presents the experience of sociological research carried out at ISEDT RAS. It serves as a tool to study the subjective factor of social development. The analysis of the sociological surveys' findings shows that the social mood of the citizens nationwide and in the Vologda Oblast is improving; this fact indicates that people are adapting to their living conditions that changed in the 2000s. At the same time, positive trends in social well-being in the Russian society are mainly associated with the satisfaction of personal and family interests. Throughout the 2000s and at present the issue of alienation of the Russian society from the government remains acute, which is indicated by the growth of the social fragmentation index and the low level of trust in the main governmental and public institutions. The authors conclude that the development of consolidation processes in Russia depends largely on the degree of interaction between the society and authorities. Domestic sociological science can play a crucial part in the solution of this problem.

Considerable degree of subjectivity in the description of the past created steady prejudice against them. On an example of documents from Archive of political documents of Administration of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic the author of article proves the thesis about the high information potential of these sources on condition of use of the offered new technique of the collective witness consisting in comparison of the maintenance of a large number of documents, belonging to participants and eyewitnesses of the concrete event which has become object of research. These sources play a special role in studying of those moments of the historical past which didn't find reflection in official documents.

AB The current era is a time of global transformation of the world order: the transit of territorial (geopolitical) format of Modernity urban culture and its main political form, the national state to geo-economic state: a dynamic modus operandi trans-boundary metapolis culture (geo-economics). Actual formula of current peace-building phase is a new regionalism, which is formed on the basis of existing economic ties within the geo-economic matrix of the new division of labor and socio-cultural gravity connecting complementary peoples in complex dynamic community, based on anthropological rather than territorial reading of post-modern political geography ("country is its people"). Key resource is the socio-cultural identity and active, productive viability manifested within the geo-economic and post-economic worldview. Folding the Russian identity is closely linked to territorial expansion in the north-east direction, which embraced both colonization and geo-cultural build vast expanses and targeted promotions to the ocean coast: wiring the Northern Sea Route, the laying of the Great Siberian tract, improvement of Maritime Province (Primorye) with access to the open spaces of the Pacific (Slavorossia - "Slavic Russia"), as well as the progressive development of Turkestan and Northeast China ("Yellow Russia") with the prospect of implementing the idea of Trans-Eurasian springboard. Primary means of expansion and improvement conceived transport arteries, mainly railway construction: Trans-Siberian, Chinese Eastern Railway, South Manchurian Railway, and other Trans-Caspian routes. Implementation of large-scale transport and infrastructure megaproject in Russian was completed at the beginning of the 20th century and was the basis for industrial, industrial takeoff.

AB This essay reflects on a particular manner in which modernisation have taken place in the Balkans in modern history, from the 1878 Berlin Congress onwards. The Balkan countries faced twofold difficulties in their development: they had to overcome their backwardness stemming from the centuries of the Ottoman yoke and catch up with modern Western Europe, and resolve their numerous mutual territorial and political disputes. The latter task was especially difficult due to the constant interference in Balkan affairs on the part of Great Powers. This interference further aggravated nationalistic tensions between the Balkan states. The peculiar mixture of modernisation efforts and nationalism remains to this day when the entire region strives to join the European Union.

DE legal regulation; volunteer activity; volunteer programs.
AB The study is devoted to the analysis of legal regulation of volunteer activity, and to the formulation of suggestions on the improvement of Russian legislation in the sphere of volunteer activity.
   Carrying out of the research is based on international, foreign and domestic sources of a normative and recommended character.
   The research was conducted on the basis of an integrated approach and the principle of methodological pluralism.
   The international level of legislation is represented in the study by the U.N.O., International Red Cross and International Association for Volunteer Effort documents.
   The analysis of foreign countries legislation on volunteer activity includes both special laws on volunteer activity (the laws of Portugal, Italy, Czechia, Poland, and others) and the laws on charitable activity (the laws of Lithuania, Great Britain, and others).
   The study of the Russian Federation legislation covers both the federal and the regional levels (legislation of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and others).
   The study gives the list of volunteer programs, most widely-spread in Russia and foreign countries.

   In conclusion of the study:
   1. the principles of volunteer activity are pointed out and its definition is formulated;
   2. the conclusion is drawn about the necessity of legislative differentiation of the volunteer and other forms of socially useful activity taking into account the different criteria;
   3. changes in Russian legislation concerning guarantees of volunteer activity (recovery of expenses of volunteers on voluntary insurance) are suggested.
   The results obtained in the course of research are applicable in the field of legal and political sciences, as well as in the spheres of state administration and education.

AB The article concerns the History Department of Moscow's Institute of Red Professors (1921-1930), whose graduates actively participated in the political and scholarly life of the country during the 1920s (A. N. Slepkov, I. I. Mints, A. M. Pankratova and others). It investigates the department's training program, the composition of its teaching staff and students, and its party and scholarly work. The author argues that the activity of the institute was determined by one of the primary tasks of the party - the struggle on the ideological front. Marxist views were considered to be the only scientifically-defendable ones during those years. Therefore the criticism of non-Marxist scholarly theories was prioritized and non-party instructors working on even the most arcane periods were placed under Communist control. The goal of preparing a "new type of scholar" ("the red professor") and politically-active personnel led the institute to admit only party members, for the most part. It also determined the specific character of the institute's work (specifically, the prioritizing of seminars and the absence of specialized courses) and the topics of study (social and economic development, class conflict, popular movements). Students were obliged to be engaged in professional pedagogical work (teaching courses in their specialty in higher educational institutions, workers' schools and the institutes' preparatory program), supplementing propagandist cadres. In the opinion the author, the Institute of Red Professors was simultaneously a center for training, scholarship and party ideology.

DT Article
DE the openness and closedness of the institutions; public openness of the

AB The topic of the article is a resumptive conceptualization of institutional and discursive innovations connected with updating and practical ensuring of a new quality of public openness of the state.
   The author's concern is the formation of the complete, internally differentiated subsystem of concepts of public openness which is integrated and develops a conceptual system of social studies. For this purpose, strangely enough, it is necessary to be exempted from the power of the commonly accepted modern political discourse. The explanation of a dialectic unity of the openness and closedness, as necessary parts of human existence, is an essential methodological basis.
   It allows to define more accurately the concept of "The Open State".
   Public openness of the state is simultaneously a factor of the social development and a social risk. The institutionalization of the open state is the answer to growing risks of the informative asymmetry in the conditions of postmodern existence of mankind in a global, IT coherent megalopolis. The open state is an institutionally determined measure of public openness. Four levels of the public openness are picked out: managerial openness, openness of the staff, civil openness and informational openness of the state. The conclusion, which determines the system of coordinates for the rationalizing and engineering of the social world, is that the public openness, which always is a source of chaos, acted as a factor of social development; it needs to be turned from the elements of human sociality into an institutional quality of the state.

AB Some results of a comparative study of modernization in two Islamic countries, Iran and Turkey, are presented in the article. A number of controversial issues are addressed. Firstly, among the factors impeding modernization the relationship between the role of culture and that of management is considered. In other words, was this the specificity of the Islamic civilization, or rather the quality of the reforms themselves that hindered modernization in a number of Islamic countries largely? Secondly, what was the role that sociocultural and political competencies of society played for successful modernization through radical economic reforms, the author questions.

AB D. Streltsov's monograph is devoted to the processes of Japan's political modernization in the Heisei epoch opened in 1991 with the accession of Akihito, today's Emperor, to the throne. The author analyzes the tasks Japan faces under the conditions of transition to the new paradigm of societal development, as well as the role of the institutional, socio-political, socio-economic and other factors in the country's political development in 1990-2010. Japan has now to be looking for answers to questions far from simple: is it advisable to go on following the postwar model of development, or are new methods to be worked out and applied - new methods of political, economic and social direction and regulation, better corresponding to the fundamental changes called forth by globalization of the world processes? The monograph is, in its way, the summary result of the many years of the author's work in the research of the political processes in Japan, of the system of the state government of the country.

TI Individual Labour Disputes: Fundamentals of Labour Law

DT Article
DE Legal theoretical definitions; terms; the concept of individual labour
   disputes; bodies to examine and settle; chapter 60 of the Russian
   Federation Labour Code; its further development
AB The paper examines the issues of the definitions of individual labour disputes, the bodies considering and settling them according to the Russian Federation Labour Code and the labour law doctrine. The study attempts to shape up new approaches to define the conception of individual labour disputes in Russian labour law. The science of Russian labour law lacks a properly developed conception of individual labour disputes, bodies to examine and settle them, which, obviously, conditions the problems of applying appropriate norms of labour legislation, other normative legal acts, containing the norms of labour law, collective agreements, agreements, local normative acts, labour agreements. The aain of the research is to keep developing the conception of individual labour disputes and the bodies to deal with them as well as to increase the efficiency of their legal regulation. To achieve this aim the following tasks should be solved: 1) show a brief history of the concept, 2) reveal the characteristics of individual labour disputes, 3) define individual labour disputes, 4) analyse as a system the bodies examining and settling such disputes; 5) introduce suggestions to develop chapter 60 of the Russian Federation Labour Code. The object of the research is the relations to examine and settle individual labour disputes, the subject-matter is the norms on individual labour disputes of the Russian Federation labour law, theoretical provisions of labour law academics on the research. The novelty of the research is that fundamental issues and problems to examine and solve individual labour disputes in current social and economic environment are studied on the basis of theories, the Russian Federation Constitution, UN International Pact on civil and political rights, legal position of the European Human Rights Court, the Russian Federation Labour Code. The formulated theoretical provisions and conclusions develop the conceptual model of examining and settling individual labour disputes, serve the basis for further research in this area and can be used to develop the Russian Federation Labour Code and other normative legal acts containing the norms of labour law.

AB In this second part of the article the author's attention is concentrated on political consultants and technologists as subjects of political regulation. The problem is posed of scientific identification of this new segment of the political class of modern democracies. Their activity most seriously influencing the political system's development, is not described by the existing political science categories. In Russia, because of its historical particularities, the role of political consultants and technologists, on the one hand, proved to be especially important, and, on the other, has almost no public elucidation. Meanwhile the dimensions of their involvement in the political process today to a great extent determine characteristics of the political regime of this or that country. In the author's opinion, the said personages' entry in nowadays politics and their accomplishment of meaningful administrative functions makes it allowable to speak of "regulable democracy" as of an especial variety of political regime, whose legitimacy is achieved by manipulating with public moods.

AB The new stage of the Russian statehood development in the direction of the stable democracy dictates the need for transition from the virtual political space to the real. The key element of this transition seems to be the formation not only of the positive image but also the reputation of the Russian power. There is a variety of approaches to the study of the image and reputation features of various political subjects in the scientific literature due to the multifaceted and complex character of these phenomena - an object of different sciences. However, the scientific research dictates the need for a precise and accurate interpretation of the notions of reputation and power with reference to the social reality. The author proposes a way to reveal key differences between the concepts 'image' and 'reputation' based on the analysis of a number of research approaches and the results of the sociological research of the regional power reputation in the Smolensk region. The articles systematizes the basic approaches to studying the image and reputation (in particular, of the power), specifies the empirical indicators of these concepts, indicates the author's interpretation of these concepts and their regional dimension ('reputation of the regional power') through the eyes of the main subject of its assessment - the population of the Smolensk region.

The analysis has been carried out taking into account the latest amendments in the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation, affecting the procedural status of the prosecutor at the initial stage of the criminal procedure, i.e. at the stage of criminal case initiation. The author examined three areas of prosecutor's supervision at this stage of investigation: prevention, detection and elimination of violations of the criminal procedure law committed by the subordinated law enforcement bodies when receiving, recording and reviewing information about the crime. The article sums up the conclusion that the position of legislators in determining the scope of prosecutor's supervisory competence at the initial stage of the criminal procedure is not fully formed. Therefore, the author has developed science-based proposals for improving legislative regulation of procedural powers of the prosecutor at the stage of criminal case initiation for each of the areas of prosecutor's supervision.

DE World War I; Kursk region; military espionage; Department of gendarmes;
   police; war prisoners
AB The article presents the activities of the public authorities on discovering and suppressing military espionage in the Kursk region during the World War I. The author analyzed the documents of the Kursk region archives, most of which were introduced into the scientific use for the first time. During World War I the Kursk province was not frontal, but it was a typical rear region of the European part of Russian. On its territory there were garrisons and rear units of the Russian army, houses of prisoners of war (POWs), hospitals, and important railway lines. Therefore, for the purposes of National Security, Police Department and its subordinate offices -Provincial Departments of Gendarmes (PDG), performed a great number of functions for Counterintelligence, such as: monitoring the foreigners, supervision for the POWs, control over the suspicious persons movement, tracking the spirits of the urban and rural residents and their contacts with the foreigners; besides they fulfilled the functions of the military censors, etc. In the Kursk province the special military censorship was created in order to overview correspondence. The special responsibility of the military censors was monitoring the printing houses, book trade, cinemas and theaters. Based on the large amount of the factual material the article analyzes the activities of the Kursk provincial Gendarme department on detecting espionage, political unreliability, and preventing anti-war propaganda in the region. In the Kursk province there was an enhanced surveillance for the German, Austrian and Hungarian subjects, as well as for the prisoners of war, who had come from the theatre of operations, because the police feared that among them there were revolutionaries, who had created a serious threat to the public order and the public tranquility. According to the documents of State Archive of the Kursk Region (SAKR), in order to prevent military espionage PDG also established a priori control over the observance of the passport and visa regulations, and in the first instance - over the passports of those arriving from abroad. In general, the article underlines the successful and productive contribution of the Kursk province counterintelligence offices into the defense of the national interests, compliance with the military secrets and espionage counteraction during World War I.

AB The article shows that the main factors constraining socio-cultural modernization are social inequality and low standard of living. A swift modernization development requires the presence of a favorable environment that gives an impetus to the society for modernization, as well as certain (modern) level of innovation, technological and socio-cultural development. In addition, the advantages and problems related to the assessment of modernization in the regions of the Federal District, based on the methodology developed at China Center for Modernization Research, the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Modernization is considered as a process that leads not only to technological and innovation progress, but mainly to favorable changes in society and to the improvement of human potential with the preservation of traditions and cultural heritage. The study has found out that the hampering of modernization in the Northwestern Federal District includes two aspects: economic and cognitive. For most of the territories the main reasons hindering the processes of modernization are lack of resources, low share of industries with high added value, low level of development of R&D sector. We also note that one of the most acute problems lies in extremely high level of regional differences. The level of life in the regions differs in several times, which also impedes modernization in all Russia's territory. Social inequality in the society is deepening due to the fact that many social institutions that are to serve as the means of social mobility do not work. Due to the above problems, modernization requires political will and effective public administration. The main task of the government that speaks about modernization is to conduct a forward-looking policy and institutional reforms aimed equally at the development of innovations, new technological structure, and the development of civil society, cultural values and standards that allow people to realize their potential to the fullest extent.

Respective interactions of the EU with the G20, the IMF and the Financial Stability Board are explored. The notion of transnational spaces is employed to study the emergence, beyond national frameworks, of new centers of decision-making and decision-taking, in which national governments and regulators still participate. The analysis of the European institutions enhancing their standing in the world affairs by implementing global-level financial decisions completes the picture.

AB The second half of the twentieth century was marked by a wave of the so- called "turns" "linguistic turn", "narrative turn", "biographical turn" and "visual turn", which have led to an obvious shift in research interests and methodological choices in humanities and social sciences. The researchers from various disciplinary fields have admitted that, to understand the logic of different forms of knowledge, we have to examine their "textual" (narrative, storytelling) nature; that any research in the social, political, psychological or cultural sphere turns out to be focused on linguistic issues; that social reality is inherently textual and that all social practices are constituted and structured by discourses and intense struggles of different discourses. Sociology did not stand to the side of such methodological changes: at least for two and a half decades the concepts "narrative" and "narrative analysis", "discourse" and "discourse analysis", "text", "context", "intertext", etc. have been extremely popular at the theoretical and empirical levels Nonetheless, we still have not received their precise definitions and they are interpreted quite arbitrarily, being based on the conceptual and methodological preferences of the researcher, as well as the goals and objectives of the particular applied or fundamental research project. The article identifies the key themes of the ongoing and, unfortunately, missing methodological discussions in the field of textual analysis that would be quite useful to clarify at least the criteria for the correct naming of different formats of analytical work with textual data.

AB The article presents an attempt to characterize parliamentary culture in the wake of the First Russian Revolution of 1905 through an analysis of debates in the first and second State Dumas. Three key aspects had shaped this culture and revealed themselves in the rhetoric of Duma speakers. First, the specific circumstances of establishing the Duma as the cornerstone of the modernizing political system; second, the revolution as the context of Duma activities that directly affected the behavior and stylistics of the Duma's speakers; third, the peculiarities of communication of the multiethnic and multiconfessional deputy corps of the imperial parliament. The rise of public politics in the Duma and the formation of a new type of politicians heavily drew on the traditional and even archaic institutions, social personae, and norms of behavior. This mixture of new and old elements was captured in the manner and rhetoric of Duma speakers and the culture of parliamentary polemics.

DE BRICS; gas industry; gas production; gas distribution; gas
   transportation; import-export of natural gas
AB This article presents the results of a comparative legal analysis of gas industry regulation in BRICS countries. In addition to the description of gas production in these states, the author provides a general overview of the sources of regulatory environment in the gas sector and discusses the co-relation issues between international and national laws. The nature of legal regulation of natural gas production, transportation, distribution and trade forms a significant part of this research. The author's conclusions derive from the description of legal constraints within natural gas export and import. Firstly, all BRICS countries need to develop their respective gas industries. Some BRICS countries, like Brazil, South Africa, and, to some extent, India) are radically reforming their legal systems, while others are trying to solve their problems by opening up to government and private investments within the existing regulatory system (China and Russia). Secondly, all BRICS countries currently have high level of monopolization in production, transportation, distribution and trading (to varying degrees). However, only in Russia monopoly is legally enshrined in the area of gas export. Thirdly, it appears that all BRICS governments understand the necessity to create a competitive market environment and are taking appropriate actions. Fourthly, all BRICS countries have corruption problems, as well as problems with government failures; therefore, the effect of the reforms in the short-run will depend greatly on the political will of each respective government and to a lesser degree on the quality of legal regulation.

AB The process of alignment of socio-economic development of countries and regions in the European Union (EU) - is an important aspect of European integration, which is ambiguous. Common Market Act, which is aimed at improving the economic efficiency of the entire EU, became the subject of many discussions of European researchers, which claimed that its viability on the political and socioeconomic levels depends on the ability to fairly distribute the resulting gains between countries and regions in the EU. As the result of these discussions there was a significant increase in funds allocated for the development of the regions of the EU Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and consolidation goals to equalize levels of development of the regions in the first section of the Single European Act. How effective are these efforts shows the presented analysis and assessment of regional convergence (by GDP per capita at purchasing power parity) during the economic boom of the EU (1995-2004) and in the period 2004-2011, when 12 countries in Central and Eastern Europe joined the EU at the same time.

In contrast to many other universities, oriented towards training political science lecturers or practical political consultants, MGIMO has formed its own unique, "complete cycle" political science school which is both academic and practical and is expected to teach political scientists starting from the zero level up to the highest level of proficiency as lecturers and researchers, as well as applied analysts, consultants and practicians. The originality of MGIMO political science school allows its organizational analogue, School of Political Affairs, to offer applicants to acquire wide range of requested professions and specializations, concurrently providing them deeper practical as well as theoretical training.

   sinapism; N.N. Samoilov; N.A. Samoilov; "Gorchishnik"; "Hooligan"
AB The article focuses on the history of the first Samara satirical weekly publication "Gorchishnik" (1906). There have been published 4 issues of the magazine that described social and political events in humorous poems, satires, caricatures. The weekly publication set the development vector for the following regional satirical periodical publications. Having analysed the documents, the authors have concluded that though the idea to create "Gorchishnik" has come to its publisher N.A. Samoilov during the period of active firght of state authorities with revolutionary spirit in the society, the first publication was challenging because of subjective reasons. According to the facts, the vice-governor postponed issuing the license to publish the magazine not because of political reservations but due to the bureaucracy. The official was concerned to take the decision about the publication with the name that was equal to the street ruffians' nickname that was spread in Samara in the end of 19th - beginning of 20th century. On the basis of archival documents, the authors have reconstructed the circumstances of starting and closing the magazine, and analysed invective function of its title. Having analysed the biography of the magazine founder N.A. Samoilov, the authors have found one onomastic detail that characterize the newspapers published in Samara in 1900s. That time a significant contribution in the development of local journalism was made by two people with the same name and surname. The publisher of the first satirical periodical publication, nobleman N.A. Samoilov and his namesake, writer, journalist of Samarskaya gazeta, bourgeois N.N. Samoilov were mixed sometimes even by contemporaries though they did not have anything in common. During a long time pre-revolutionary satirical publication did not relate to the interests of scientific research. However, due to the work of renowned ethnographer of Samara region G.M. Shereshevski, it became possible to understand an important role of "Gorchishnik" in the history of local press. For the first time, Shershevski's contribution to the learning of local periodical publications is being analysed in this article.

AB The article tests the wisdom of amending the OSCE rule of consensus against past experiences of introducing a "consensus minus one" procedure, establishing mandatory cooperative "mechanisms" which can be triggered by a qualified minority of states, or introducing autonomously operating institutions. It argues that amending the consensus rule does not per se lead to a stronger Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. While the participating states could benefit from more independent osce institutions, decisions leading in that direction would need time to mature, particularly in the current political environment marked by the very low level of mutual trust within the OSCE.

DE social communities; temporal characteristics
AB Considered one of the most actual in modern sociological science problems social community and its main features, among which the temporal characteristics play an important role. The purpose of the article is to analyze the role of social communities in everyday life and discovering of their temporal structures. For proof of this thesis are used in the unity of three main approaches communities, activities, and temporal. Basic methods of the research: the study of value orientations, attitudes, forms and types of activities, time spent on them (the method of time budget). Main results and conclusions are following. It is proved that the person in everyday life lives not primarily in the society, but in social groups or communities (family, work and study groups, groups of relatives and friends, associations and interest's groups, sports teams, territorial and ethnic communities, and so on). The author thinks that the social community is really exists, empirically fixed wholeness of people united by sociocultural, demographic, economic, ethnic, territorial, religious, political, professional and other foundations. Social communities are characterized by a number of their signs: relatively integrity, identification and self-identification, similar conditions of life and work and others. Temporal characteristics of the social community are very important among these signs. Social communities, their lifestyle and everyday practices are viewed through the prism of the time (temporal) characteristics of the basic kinds of activity. Focusing on such structural elements of social time, both working and non-working, learning and non-learning, free time, leisure. Lifestyle of social community is investigated as segmentation, differentiation in the way of activity, its temporal characteristics in separate elements (forms of activity and time spent on their realization) in the presence of deep inner connection between them. It is proved that the foundation of this way of life is the relationship of the main types of working and non-working activities, working, non-working and spare time. It is the objective necessity of providing conditions for the existence of social community, to meet the diverse needs of its members. Established that it is essential to the understanding of the practices of everyday life of the social community in the framework of the temporal characteristics of the main forms of activity and the fact that in Europe, called Work Life Balance (WLB), i.e., a balance between work and lifestyle. Formula WLB finds today great dissemination and is associated with satisfaction the wide and growing range of needs of everyday life.

DT Article
DE Ukraine; political technologies; psychological impact; power
AB In the paper, technologies of seizing power in Ukraine are analyzed that play a special role among other political technologies. This issue is relevant due to the growing uncontrollability of modern political processes in Ukraine, degradation of the lawful ways to hand over and to keep power. The technologies of the power seizure in Ukraine are considered in the context of the general level of society development, local political processes, development of political institutions, culture and traditions. The conditions required for applying the technologies of power seizure are discussed. The paper also focuses on the study of particular technologies of power seizure in Ukraine combining the mechanisms of political, economic and information pressing on the present powers. All the more, during the two decades of Ukraine's independence the technologies of power seizure have changed considerably. The spontaneous protest actions were replaced with well-planned and well-organized actions based on extensive financial support. In developing and conducting these actions the organizers used different areas of knowledge, many of which are interdisciplinary. This paper also highlights the psychological impact on population, application of manipulation technologies, gambling on the domestic, international, language and national issues. The author analyzes the role of the Maidan camp that is viewed by the opposition as alternative to the existing powers and is considered to be an exponent of the peoples' position. The factor of external influence on the political events in Ukraine that acquires the key role is discussed. The paper also analyzes the role of the financial, political and economic support from external forces, providing the opposition with a broad range of instruments for power seizure. The political events that occurred in Ukraine in 2014 and that ended in the coup detat urge to study further the power seizure technologies. This paper addresses the new technologies of power seizure used by opposition politicians. Differences between the technologies applied for power seizure in Ukraine in 2014 and the technologies applied in 2004 during presidential election campaign are analyzed.

AB The paper is dedicated to the development of research tools for modeling historical events and processes. The authors describe the software, theoretical approaches and techniques, as well as some heuristic difficulties and innovations arising from the adoption of new modeling tools in Social Sciences. Main attention is paid to the research of the Fractal Modeling Center of Tambov State University. The studies involve the use of methods of fractal geometry to simulate mental, demographic, historical and ecological processes, the dynamics of socio-political structures. According to the authors, fractal model can detect regularity and harmonious order in chaotic systems. The paper presents some information on fractal transition model created by the authors and on the concept of "turbulent modernization". The authors analyze the prospects of using the theory of self-organized criticality in the study of social phenomena and processes and demonstrate the possibility of integration of mathematical methods and synergetic views into the studies in Social Sciences and the Humanities by using simulation models as a kind of "heuristic machine" to formulate hypotheses and to identify potential and development alternatives.

   problem of shaping the identity of its inhabitants
SO ADEPTUS

DT Article
DE Kaliningrad; migrations; identity; nationality; religiosity
AB In the last two decades, the Kaliningrad Oblast has been subject to changes of a manifold nature, not only political but also societal and cultural. As a result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the region has become a semi-enclave which has led to the consequences of the former occupation being even greater. As a result, the Oblast differs from other parts of Russia. Experts involved with the Kaliningrad Oblast, both from Russia and abroad, agree that it constitutes a unique part of the historic, cultural and societal mosaic of Russia. It comes as no surprise that geopolitical processes have left a significant mark on the Kaliningrad Oblast identity. Nowadays the semi-exclave is often described as the most European among the Russian regions. Yet the question of the contemporary identity of the Kaliningrad Oblast's inhabitants cannot be properly addressed and examined without research into the very first years of the regions' existence (from 1945 to the end of the 1950s).
   This paper aims at briefly summing up changes that took place in the northern part of former East Prussia in four areas after the Second World War. This will include: the taking over of control by the Soviet administration of the newly conquered territory; settling the region with a new population and the deportation of Germans still remaining there; replacing German names of towns and villages with Soviet (Russian) ones; the attitude of central and local authorities towards religious communities and attempts to spontaneously organise religious life in the region.
   All of the above-mentioned elements of post-war life in the Kaliningrad Oblast contributed to the creation of a new politico-social reality which encompassed a total denial of the region's past. Together with further changes, these elements laid the foundations of the identity of its inhabitants after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In this sense, they can be considered as a starting point for further research which is my main objective as a PhD student at the Institute of Slavic Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

TI PHILOSOPHY, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES SYNERGY IN CULTURE
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

DT Article
DE culture; synergy; interaction; cultural base; theosis
AB Based on previously produced studies, the article suggests the following definition of synergy. Synergy is a combined action, the interaction of different potencies or energies that are directed to the ideal, and to producing the synergetic effect. Various approaches of understanding culture are analyzed in order to answer the questions of if it is possible to talk about synergy in culture, and what conditions are necessary for the existence of synergy in culture. In this context culture is defined as the transformation of the individual and the society in the implementation of cultural and creative activity on the basis of spiritual and moral religious views. Recognising synergy as a form of dialectics and considering the connection of dialectics and culture, the article makes an assumption, according to which it is possible to speak of synergetic development as of a form of dialectical development of culture. Since synergy is a process, the article outlines the necessary conditions for the implementation of this process. According to the definition of synergy, one of its features is the interaction of the opposites. In culture one can consider internal and external interactions. The ideal types of interaction of cultures are: dialogue, synnecrosis, assimilation, unilateral influence, transformation, concurrency, and mutual isolation, etc. But the article only deals with synergetic interaction characterized by a joint, cooperative, coordinated interaction of different potencies or energies. Therefore, the first condition of synergetic interaction in culture is the dialogic, cooperative interaction of different, even contradictory, activities and ideals. The analysis of culture in terms of the nuclear spherical concept allowed defining the "hard core" and the "protective belt" in culture. The core of culture ensures its stability, hardiness, conservatism. The Hesychast tradition recognizes the divine nature and divine energies inseparable from it as a "hard core". The second condition of synergy in culture is the presence of a "hard core" connected with the ideal of deification, which means the possibility of a person to become the God by the grace under synergy. A person joins Divine Energies in the process of synergy, and begins to change the world like God. Therefore, the third condition of synergy in culture is the synergetic effect. Synergetic effect shows in human creativity. In such a manner, in this article the terms of synergy in culture are determined, namely, the dialogic interaction of different types of activities and different ideals of cultural orientation to the higher absolute ideal, transformation of people and the world.

DE methodology; the foundations of a scientific theory; the Unifi theory
AB Under the great unification in physics was understood a theory that uniformly describes the four known types of interactions: gravitation, electromagnetic force, strong and weak interactions. The problem of a Unify theory rooted in an inconsistent understanding of the ontological foundations of different physical theories. The relevance of Unify theory is due to both the philosophical and ontological assumptions and conceptual difficulties of the theoretical physics, as well as applications of physics in cosmology. Despite the severity and the high relevance of the problem, it is still are not resolved. The analysis shows the incompatibility of the philosophical foundations of scientific theories, and allows us to consider the problem from the perspective of contradictory between theoretical views on the basic ontological categories. It's impossible to find of Unified theory without the philosophical reflection of theoretical foundations. Solving the problem of compatibility of conceptual foundations could be solved by some common language in which the interpretation of the concepts could be given so as to be shared with the language of any physical theory. It is necessary to deeply conceptual review of the concepts of space, time, matter, and causality by both scientists and philosophers.

DE reference; meaning; semantics; context
AB There is an idea in modem philosophy of language that some types of linguistic expressions are directly referential, i.e. refer to their objects independently of any descriptive or conceptual background of understanding what the expression mean. Some such expressions (names) are supposed to have stable reference while another change their reference depending on the context of use (demonstratives and indexicals). One theory firmly associated with the idea of direct reference is the theory of automatic reference. It presupposes that an expression referring to its object does so independently of the communicative intention of the user, which otherwise would determine what the utterance of this expression means in the given case. But I think that the kind of automaticity some expressions actually demonstrate under certain ways of use hardly supports the very idea of direct reference, and the automaticity presumed by the theory under consideration is more like a legend than reality. In other words, an expression may be automatically tied to certain object or class by circumstances of context, including conventions shared by the agent, or even rules determining changes of meaning due to the contexts. And communicative intentions may be not directly involved in these sorts of meaning. But they contribute indirectly. E.g. what exactly context provides for the utterance depends on how much it is itself constituted by relevant beliefs of communicators. The dependence of the reference solely on the object of this reference is a pretty obscure notion, and that was shown in the paper by several examples: the ordinary use of "I", for instance, can tie it firmly to the agent of the context, but not to any definite person, since which person it is, is determined commonly by certain kind of knowledge or concept, or belief, i.e. something convertible into the intention of utterance. In general, any term may be used in a way which makes it automatically referring to something, but this does not make any such use automatically fulfilled in any relevant context by picking up some certain object, and only it, just because there are no types of objects out there ready for such picking up.

DE ontological argument; possible worlds; God; rationality; metalogic
AB The present paper deals with the modal version of St. Anselm's ontological argument (the so-called "modal argument", or MA, developed by N. Malcolm and A. Plantinga) and the logic used therein. The authors focus on the problem of conceptual connection between the logic of this argument and some implicit ontological and epistemological assumptions inherent in it. Since this argument is constructed, in general, as a reductio ad absurdum, one of its most important prerequisites is the assumption about the logical consistency of the concept of God. This means, in effect, that God is obliged to obey the laws of classical logic (at least, the law of non-contradiction). However it is not clear how the thesis of God's rationality is consistent with the divine omnipotence. The most effective solution to this problem, in our opinion, is to apply N.A. Vasiliev's idea of the division of logic to the "empirical" ("human") and metalogic ("divine"). In the light of this division it is natural to assume that God is subject to the metalogical law of non-selfcontadiction, but He doesn't have to follow the "empirical" law of non-contradiction. And since in MA the concept of God is essentially the modal one, it is important to find out what kind of modal logic could adequately describe the nature of the divine necessity. It is unlikely that this role can play such a strong system as S5, which is the basis of MA. Rather we should call "divine" the minimal modal logic T. But then the modal argument causes the following fundamental questions: (1) How does as the existence of worlds which are subject to some "imaginary" logic affect the validity of the argument? (2) What is more important: to preserve the traditional concept of God while losing the chance to prove His existence in worlds with other "empirical" logic, or to prove the existence of God in all possible worlds, which can be thought of, but at the same time reject the classical concept of Him?

AB This article examines the concept of "ontology of consciousness" Kazimir Twardowski (1866-1938) - Polish thinker, a brilliant representative of the "scientific philosophy" of the twentieth century, the founder of the Lvov-Warsaw School.In the teaching of being Twardowski can see it as psychological interpretation, and logical. In psychological period of his life Twardowski all existential manifestation makes dependent on consciousness, developing thus a subjective ontology of being. In the so-called period of creativity antipsihologichesky Twardowski this phenomenological view gives way, relatively speaking, a moderate phenomenalism. In ontological issues this resulted in the creation of Tvardovsky its formal ontology.
   Based on the analysis of the work of Kazimir Twardowski "the doctrine of the content and scope of the presentations. Psychological research", the following highlights "ontology of consciousness" of the thinker:
   First, all the phenomena of consciousness Twardowski divided into physical and mental;
   Second, as the basis of psychic phenomena Twardowski considered view;
   Third, Twardowski defended the idea of the existence of "non-objective representations", i. e, views that do not correspond to any object;
   Fourth, based on Brentano's understanding of mental acts as intentional mental phenomena, Twardowski distinguishes in the act and the subject of the representation. Novation Twardowski in the theory of mental acts is that he, along with the subject of the act also introduced the content of the act and found that intentional attitudes directed to the content.
   Overall, based on the analysis theory of being K. Twardowski, one can see that the psychological and logical interpretation of the ontological perspective Twardowski are combining their beginning, which is a linguistic accent, as developed in the framework of the "theory of judgment." The central concept here is the notion of "judgment," which connects Twardowski mental act.

AB Understanding stable tension of social systems in General and the personnel of the enterprise in particular, is impossible without general knowledge. Abstracting from system-specific common ground system stability, at various stages of its development, allow you to clearly understand dialectical unity of opposites - stability and variability. However, the "struggle" of these opposite sides as self-contradiction "joint action" generates energy. Energy joint ventures not only supports - provides activities in time, but is the basis for development of joint activities. On the other side, each system exists and develops in the environment. As a system, it is at the same time and the other, the wider system. This enhanced system, on the one hand, leads to sustainability of the system (as a member), on the other hand, in the process of interaction with her you must require its variability, thus - external conflict of "working together".

DE globalization; global community; global net society; net; net structures
AB The paper presents interpretation of globalization concerned the net community formation, which exploits a normatively attractive alternative to existing concepts of globalization. It is argued here that development of contemporary world community manifests the implementation of a form of global net community.In most recent theoretical debates depending on the character of the process of globalization (homogeneous or fragmentary), two trends of investigation of this process arise: (i) globalization on the basis of the idea of progress which leads to a homogeneous world and maintains hierarchical structures (universalism), (ii) globalization on the basis of the representation of the world real diversity which supports net community formation (multiculturalism). As for universalistic discussions, the tendency to assume opposite values - on the segment comprising corporative version of globalization and elite version of globalization - arises. Multicultural concepts of globalization, based on the recognition of the world diversity, are popular because of their non-repressive, tolerant and net form. Appraisals of multiculturalism as an intellectual trend, which could be evaluated as the of recent multi-globalization process, are controversial (for example as in the works by J. Searle, R. Rorty C. Taylor, etc). The theorists of globalization stress the fact that modern globalization process include many instances of globalization. Paper mainly concentrated on several trends of interpretation of globalization: historical, social, legal, informational and net globalization. It is argued here that informational nets change the actual production, consumption, power, experience and culture in a great scale. Global net organizations represent a new type of net structure based of political institutions and international, national, local institution of decision making. Individualization and decentralization are the opposite with respect to the socialization work, vertical integration and big production - which characterize industrial society forms of organization and interaction. Modern net organization guarantee the flexibility of firms, individual, countries in conditions of globalization.

DE human existence; existentialism; philosophical anthropology
AB This article analyzes the principal work of Heidegger. The author tried to lay out the basic features of Heidegger's understanding of the human being in comparison with the philosophical anthropology. The text is the overall exposure of Heidegger's understanding of the world in its relation to man. We consider both the historical and philosophical origins of Heidegger's ideas and especially his own position. Heidegger often mentions the ideas of Kant, Aristotle, Hegel, Husserl, Scheler and Kierkegaard. The essence of Heidegger's ontology of world order that the correlation of the "subject" and "object" is set initially. And in this correlation privileged or establish, a leading component is Dasein. Heidegger says about the original individual, describing the general categories of "humanity" or "species" of both formal and empty. He calls the philosophy of life and philosophical anthropology "ontology of life", setting it lower in comparison with his "ontology of presence". All the arguments of Heidegger represent the "circular reasoning" and he admits it. Indeed, "being" is only "human." Being non-humans do not. He then introduces the idea of "existence" and in line with it explains all of human existence or the world. This is the norm for the "philosophy of consciousness" where consciousness is extended to his emotional characteristics. So, the very human being is a full circle and it is necessary to get inside.Key chapters of the treatise devoted to human self-understanding. This is the analysis of the consciousness of mortality, guilt, conscience and determination. Heidegger's existential analysis has given impressive results in terms of understanding the fate of potentially personal principle in man. This is a profound teaching necessary for understanding the deep motivation and internal events that take place in human hearts. Especially it comes to the minds of those who are constantly transcend human limits.

AB The article is dedicated to function of ability of imagination in Kant's ontology. This function by the most detailed and exhaustive way is presented to M. Heidegger's interpretations, stated in his early lecture courses "Phanomenologische Interpretation von Kants Kritik der reinen Vemunft" and "Kant and das Problem der Metaphusik". The unique, author's interpretation is first presented in article, poorly known to the Russian-speaking reader; arguments "in advantage" fundamental nature of ability of imagination are secondly catalogued; thirdly, is carried out border between "authentic" and "modernizing" reading of "Critique", between the reading corresponding "to a letter and spirit" the original, and development of own ontology by M. Heidegger on the basis of interpretation Kant's works . In article three fragments from "Critique of Pure Reason" where it is a question of ability of imagination are analysed: it & sect;10 - 6 paragraphs dividing the table of judgments and the table of categories; the section about schemes of pure rational concepts; also the section about apprehension synthesis, reproduction synthesis, recognition synthesis. In article on the example of interpretation & sect;10 " Critique" it is shown that idea of fundamental nature of ability of imagination is completely authentic and corresponding to the "Critique" text, and also that Kant's author's editing in the second "Critique" edition, generates only coherent contradictions in the specified fragment and the text as a whole. On a material of interpretation of the section about schemes the correctness of Heidegger's interpretation of transcen-dental power of imagination as the ability defining time and being a source of the content of pure rational concepts is shown. On a material of interpretation of three synthesis the "mixed" nature of Heidegger's interpretation concerning synthesis of an apprehension and synthesis of a reproduction, and obviously modernizing nature of interpretation concerning synthesis of a recognition is shown. It is shown that interpreting recognition synthesis as "directed on the future", M. Heidegger:
   1) actually ignores the Kant's doctrine about ability of imagination as ability by means of which it is possible "to represent the past and the future";
   2) modernizes Kant's idea of subjectivity as having temporary structure that there doesn't correspond to Kant's judgment about our knowledge concerning "the transcendental subject".
   In article it is indicated also dual nature of the Heidegger's interpretation which is guided both by a canon of "a historical hermeneutics", and a canon of "a philosophical hermeneutics" that partly darkens actually "historical" value of interpretation of ability of imagination as fundamental ability.

DE deflationism; metaphysics; truth; meaning; reference; fact; value
AB Deflationism is a broad, diverse and very interesting trend in contemporary analytic philosophy. Deflationism pre-supposes and naturally "generate" your answer to metaphysical questions. Of course, if you take into account the nature and basic intuitions behind deflationism, the resulting metaphysical explanation seems more likely explanation for the question of correlation of language and the world, through which the number of explanations for the basic concepts is "refracted". This is, first of all, the concept of truth, reference, meaning, value and fact. Deflationary theory of truth is such a theory of truth, according to which the concept of truth is understood as metaphysically thin concept, performing the language-specific logical and linguistic functions (generalization, indirect speech, "semantic ascent"), fully explainable by the equivalence scheme. Thus, in the deflationary theories of truth it is stated that the truth has no metaphysical character and is not a property (at least, in the usual sense of the word). The common point of deflationary definition of truth and deflationary definition of reference is that the notions of truth and reference are special logical tools that greatly extends the expressive capabilities of a language. This approach leads to the construction of a theory of meaning as use, which states that meanings are not representative or relational. The meanings have the following characteristics: they are substantively and naturalistic, they are reducible to the properties of non-semantic nature, namely to the use. Deflationism can serve as an argument in favor of non-cognitivism in considering the Frege-Geach problem. Deflationism allows you to "construct" the truth conditions. This suggests that we have no criterion for distinguishing real and deflational ("fictional") facts, and facts are not really exist, but they are the case only by the adoption of such a point of view that they (and objects participating in these facts) are the case. In this case, they "exist" in accordance with the principles of a given language game. Obviously, deflationism is the opposite of realism. However, although the opposite of realism is anti-realism, there's a methodological similarity between realism and anti-realism - both realist's and anti-realist's notions of truth are epistemic concepts. According to realism and to anti-realism truth has a certain metaphysical nature, deflationism denies that the truth has underlying meta-physical nature, so deflationism is opposed to both realism and anti-realism. Thus, deflationism is not purely anti-metaphysical conception, metaphysics is only reduced, "trimmed" to a certain minimum amount.

DE reductionism; synergetics; transdisciplinary; interdisciplinary studies
AB This article covers the role of the concepts of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity in the new stage of development of science associated with the development of nonlinear natural science after the cognitive revolution, and with new discoveries such as the programs of unitary gauge theories, the general scientific research program, the introduction of the concept of post-non-classical science with such characteristics as changing nature of scientific reality due to computerization, and considering the object of science as a complex, self-sustaining system. One of the essential characteristics of the post-non-classical science is interdisciplinarity. At present the problem of interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity draws the attention of scientific communities and schools, but the use of these concepts, especially transdisciplinarity, has not been clarified yet, which is why the article analyzes the existing perspectives and approaches to these concepts and presents the author's approach. Interdisciplinarity is the interaction between the systems of disciplinary knowledge, which manifests itself as the transfer of the principles of one science to another. Often this transfer, also metaphorically called "paradigmatic vaccination", results in the use of the language and categorical instrument of one science to interpret the facts of another. The so-called "paradigmatic vaccination" can call forth criticism, and the creation of interdisciplinary design projects, when the disciplinary science becomes a "problem-oriented". Transdisciplinarity, as a new type of production and integration of scientific knowledge, is characterized by common research programs, cognitive schemes which work in the new system of new objects of cognition and activity. Transdisciplinarity, along with the physical, chemical, biological, psychological, technical components, also includes the social, liveral components of transdisciplinary integration. The development of transdisciplinarity entails the need for a transdisciplinary conceptual tool of integration where the classical language of description, based on the concepts of mass, energy, spatial relationships, has to be supplemented with the language of socio-humanistic descriptions, based on the concepts of needs, goals, ideals, interest, responsibility, duty, etc. Transdisciplinarity thus involves the study and implementation of a problem on several levels, for example, the physical and the mental, the global and the local.

DE ontology; semantics; primitive concepts; Hilbert; axioms; definitions
AB One of the important questions the foundations of mathematics, dating from the late 19th century, was the question of ontological status of primitive terms. Frege in his clarifying the conceptual apparatus of mathematical thinking was opposing and the new interpretation of the axiomatic method by Hilbert. The part of this controversies was the question about the status of the primitive concepts in mathematics. The cause of polemics at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries became the status of geometry. Frege, disputing Kant's thesis on synthetic nature of the truths of arithmetic, has left the status of synthetic a priori for the truths of geometry. The publishing of Hilbert's "Foundations of geometry" marked a whole era not only in mathematics, but also in its philosophy. Hilbert's axiomatic method was the subject of discussion between him and Frege concerning the question, can we consider the axioms as a definition of concepts. When trying to determine the objects of geometry as it is presented in an axiomatic form by Hilbert, we stumble on the implicit definitions of "point", "straight" and so on. These definitions are implicit in the sense that they do not talk directly, what is the point or what is line, but rather are the specifications of the "point" is related to "line". In other words, these concepts are irrelevant to our intuition or perception of space, and all that is required is that the terms fulfill the axioms. This is a new way to address the role of axioms as hidden or implicit definitions. The ontology of mathematical systems, such as points, lines or natural numbers can be introduced in two different ways. On the one hand, for each object, a precise definition is required. On this way insist Frege and Dedekind. On the other hand, ontology is entered through the implicit definitions which characterize the entire system. This is the point of view of Hilbert. As has already been stated, from a traditional perspective, it is difficult to see how cumbersome can define ontology axioms at all. In fact, Hilbert's axioms define the ontology of course, but in a slightly different way. Frege had demonstrated that these axioms define the concepts of higher orders. There are two positions about the sufficiency of axioms for description of mathematical field. Firstly, our use of mathematical terms are captured by axioms incompletely, so we need further explanation. But it is precisely this kind of explanation has not been accepted by Hilbert, believing that the axioms themselves. The motive for this decision is the inaccuracy of the explanations. Indeed, Frege had rendered the explanations as belonging to the "background" of science, i.e., what is not included in proper science.
   Hilbert believed that mathematics is self-sufficient in what she said, without further explanation. But this means that primitive terms are not fixed in advance. In other words, the primitive Hilbert's terms lacks the substantiality. They are simple schemes that must be filled with content in the application of mathematics to the outside world. In this case, however, is not quite clear how we understand the mathematical assertion. The theoretical difficulty is following:If there is a primitive simple diagrams, they are variables, but what semantics can be assigned to variables? Hilbert did not accept explanations of the primitive terms. One of the most plausible conjecture is that he was strongly influenced by the philosophy of Kant, and the idea of organizing the material experience by mind was very close to him. In this regard, the experience of having a scheme perfectly fit the role that Hilbert had put the science.

AB On the basis of the J.L. Austin's theory of performatives utterances and its comparison with the Hart's theory of the primary and secondary rules it's made the conclusion about genetic and theoretical succession of understanding the action in the analytic philosophy of law due to the theory of speech acts. Hart's analytic philosophy is full of the ideas L. Witgenstein's last works and Austin's theory of speech acts. "Concept of Law" is founded on understanding the system of law as a system of primary and secondary rules and deduces from certain point of Austin's understanding doing action. It's necessary: a) to reconstruct the Hart's the way of thinking on the point of his understanding the law as mobile unity of primary and secondary rules; b) due to the idea of relevance of Austin's theory of performative utterances and Hart's theory of primary and secondary rules, we have to study the categorical accordance and problems that follows from the it's theoretical succession. Let's make a question about the way of connection of the "Concept of Law" with Austin's theory of performatives utterances. It's necessary to pay attention to Austin's doctrine of the Infelicities that is devoted to necessary conditions of successful or unsuccessful communication. The subjects of Austin's analysis are becoming the conditions that make the communication difficult. It's obvious that the genesis of concept of action repeats the structure of Austin's the meaning of action as performative is given by Hart's distinction in his theory of ascription and has important and fundamental meaning to the creating the system of law as the system of primary and secondary rules. It shows the common theoretical and methodological field of performative utterances and Hart's analytic philosophy of law and inner unity Hart's philosophy at all.

TI THE OWNERSHIP OF ALTAI AND NERCHINSK PLANTS WITHIN THE CABINET HOUSEHOLD
   (1747-1861): IS THE DISCUSSION WORTH CONTINUING?
SO SIBERIAN HISTORICAL RESEARCH-SIBIRSKIE ISTORICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Editorial Material
DE Cabinet; Cabinet household in Siberia; power; property; poll tax
AB Since the late 1950s the research into the issue of Cabinet household ownership was accompanied by a discussion which is still ongoing. Concepts based on assumptions, the patrimonial theory of Russian statehood, and the unsupported statements on the absence of Cabinet household's legal status not only contributed to the continuation of the discussion, they laid the foundation for the search for new research niches, for finding new ways to define the owner of the Cabinet household since 1747.
   The common denominator for all these concepts was the neglect of the clauses of the Decrees of May 1 and May 12, 1747, which gave an unambiguous answer to the questions about the terms of confiscating plants and determining their new owner. Despite the unquestionable competence of all the scholars engaged in the solution of the most debatable issue over the nature of Cabinet household, it turns out that no one went beyond speculations on the wording of the titles of the Decrees of May 1 and May 12, 1747, such as "taking in favour of the treasury" and "ordered to take upon Ourselves". Nobody paid attention to the clause on those living near the Kolyvano - Voskressensk plants who were obliged to to carry out work for those plants. They began to pay poll tax to the owner of the plants and to the state budget separately. This fact is still being disregarded. Obviously, that clause turned out to be sufficient to decide on the owner of the plants since 1747 as all the subsequent legislation further confirmed the aforementioned decrees. It is possible that this way of solving the ownership problem after having confiscated the plants from A. Demidov's heirs reflected the disguised appropriation by Elizaveta Petrovna of the territory of West Siberia rich in ore, forests and farmland.
   New ways proposed to solve the problem of Cabinet household ownership through referring to the materials of state revisions in Altai or through the interdisciplinary approach can hardly bring results. The reliance on the contemporary achievements of history as well as those of political science, economics, theory of state and law and other latest theoretical concepts do not promise positive results for the ongoing discussion.
   Reading carefully the Decrees of May 1 and May 12, 1747, which are not easy - to perceive by contemporary scholars, allows drawing a convincing and very simple, at first sight, conclusion that the tax reform of Peter I which replaced the household tax of the state peasantry with the 70-copeck poll tax became the basis for the definition of the plants' ownership since 1747. Apart from that, as was the case with the landlord peasantry, they were to pay the 40-copeck "landlord taxes" to the state budget.
   Apparently, the emergence and decades-long continuation of the debate which can last for years to come has become an inevitable outcome of neglecting the Decrees of 1747. It resulted in the scholars' hesitations in search for the owner of the Cabinet household.
   The entrenched since the 1980s idea that the state was the supreme owner of land and manufacturing facilities in Siberia where no landlord estate emerged is not consistent with the reality. Such estate did emerge and develop until the reform of 1861 providing its owner with the status of Russia's major landlord. All the economic resources of this estate were oriented to mining.
   The conditions of owning the Cabinet plants and lands and the reception of income from them satisfied all the successors of Elizaveta Petrovna up to Nicholay II. After the reform of 1861, Emperors being landlords received 4.5 rubles out of the six-ruble rent paid by peasants while the remaining 1.5 rubles went to the state treasury in accordance with the order legalized yet in 1747.

AB The paper is devoted to the sociological turn in law studies in Russia. The sociology of law is a new concept for the Russian sociology and is not widely recognized as a discipline with own developed theoretical background and research methods. One of the recent developments that gave rise to the new sociology of law in Russia was the creation in 2009 of the Institute for the Rule of Law (IRL) in the European University at Saint Petersburg. The mission of the Institute is to facilitate judicial and law enforcement reforms and to uphold the principle of the rule of law in Russia. This goal is pursued by means of academic and policy-oriented study conducted within the research tradition known as Law and Society, which is way beyond pure sociology of law and takes advantage of related disciplines, such as economic sociology, new institutional economics, law and economics, political science and others. In the brief overview, the author addresses four most interesting areas of studies. First, it refers to extra-legal influences on court decisions that can result in regularities implicit in the decision making process in arbitration and civic courts in Russia. Second, it provides sociological views on judges as a professional community. Third, it proposes an institutional analysis of the judicial decisions that are overwhelmingly biased towards prosecution. Fourth, it discusses issues of copyright law and its implications, especially under faster development of the Internet technologies. Reviewing the fourth research areas, the author demonstrates how sociologists challenge this autonomy of law and study external social influences. Thus, they shows "law in action" in a real society.

TI DIAGNOSTICS OF SOCIAL POTENTIAL REALISATION OF THE RUSSIAN ARCTIC

AB At the post- industrial stage of development of particular significance is the realization of social potential as part of the national (regional) wealth and human potential. At the same time the existing institutional structure (educational system, health authorities, social security, public services, etc.) determine not only the quality of the political system, but also the level of the society development, the life quality of the population as a whole. Given the fact that the main factor is the social potential of the population, as well as the institutions that create conditions for its implementation, the content of social potential is seen as a set of options available to the territorial entity of sustainable development in order to ensure a high quality of life. The unique geo- political and geo-economic potential of the Russian Arctic territory allows positioning it as an area of the social responsibility of the state. Due to the fact that the development of the Arctic regions, Russia as a whole, in the 21st century will be determined predominantly by the level of the social potential, specific tools are required to perform assessment of its size and dynamics. Their application will help to clarify the priorities of social policy, as well as the formation of the complex measures for their implementation, depending on the features of regional development. With the development of tools evaluating implementation of the elements of regional capacity, including social ones, the following provisions were adopted as fundamental: - consideration of a balanced development as one of the imperatives of sustainable development; - adoption of a balanced level of all the subsystems of the region, as a criterion and the magnitude of the regional capacity; - use as the characteristics of the social potential of performance indicators that reflect the impact on the regional development of the quality of education, health status, living standards, etc. This paper presents methodological tools for assessing the implementation of the elements of regional potential, based on the use of principal-factor method, which is part of an integrated multi-factor analysis of the variability of structures allowing to investigate the influence of the analyzed factors on the total variance. The authors propose an approach that, in contrast to the classical interpretation of the principalfactor method results, takes into account the impact on the development of a complex dynamic system, which is the region, in the first place, all the major components, and, second, each factor separately. The results of the approbation of these tools on information files of the Russian Federation regions subjects for 2000-2010 in the section of the social potential testify to a lower, than the whole across Russia, level of its realization in the regions of the Russian Arctic.

DE parties; social-democracy; ideology; institutionalization; opposition
AB The author of this article analyzes and characterizes the main tendencies of the development of social democracy in Europe and modern Russia, as well as the peculiarities of the party institutionalization. The perspective of the development of the social-democracy is analyzed. The EU countries have significant differences in political systems, socio-economic development, national and cultural characteristics. In the former Socialist countries of Europe social democratic parties were formed on the basis of the Communist parties. The main current political task for these countries is their integration into European structures and NATO. The social-democratic parties, organizations and movements today claim to be the main actors in the process of creation of a progressive post-capitalist society. The author claims that there is a demand for Social Democracy in Russia, given the social situation in the country and the social expectations of the population. After the change in the legislation about party activities, the quantity of social democratic parties in Russia increased. The institutionalization of these parties with further transition to the status of parliamentary ones could lead to the formation of a full-fledged social democratic trend in Russia. Such a development will contribute to the formation of a multiparty democracy, pluralism and polyarchy of interests. In general, the social-democratic parties today claim to be the main actors in the construction of post-capitalist society. It becomes evident that the balance of political forces shifted to the left, but the question of the ability of global social democracy to rebuild the political system, both in Russia and in Europe, is still open.

AB The political project of a conservative writer of political essays of the second half of the XIX c. R. A. Fadeev (1824-1883), in which a key part is assigned to the attraction of the Cossacks of Southern Russia to solving the pressing foreign policy issues, is analyzed. A conclusion that the Cossacks could be used as a militant vanguard, i.e. military force (infantry, cavalry, reconnaissance) and an effective tool of the colonization of the suburbs of the Russian Empire - is drawn. The conditions under which R. A. Fadeev could implement his plans are revealed. The key condition is the preservation of the identity of the Cossacks as a class and as a sub-ethnos. The historical assessment of the R. A. Fadeev's plans is given.
   According to the plans R. A. Fadeev, revived after the reforms of its military power, Russia should not only play a key role in international relations, but also strive for a first impact and then rule on its neighboring Asian and European territories. And in the perspective he saw the new world order, in which there would be two dominating superpowers, Russia and the United States. The Cossacks were assigned an important role in the implementation of these plans by the publicist. This geopolitical project, no matter how attractive it was not for the Russians at first glance, was a utopia. The publicist obviously overestimated the military and economic capabilities of contemporary Imperial Russia, the ability of the autocracy to the socio-economic and political renewal of the country corresponding to the demands of the times. Consequently, the Cossacks were not destined to play the role which was assigned to them by R. A. Fadeev. Althoughhe anticipated accurately the individual elements of the future world order established for several decades in the XX century.

AB Vladimir A. Kitaev was born 1941. He was the first dean of the Faculty of History and the first head of the Department of History of the USSR (now the Department of History of Russia) of Volgograd State University, reputable scientist, recognized expert in the history of the Russian social thought. The article shows the role of V.A. Kitaev in the formation and development of the faculty and the department. A characteristic of V.A. Kitaev' sresearch and teaching activities is given. Kitaev's featuresas a scholar and teacher such as great erudition, science scrupulosity, exactingness to himself andto his disciples, are marked.
   V.A. Kitaev worked at Volgograd State University for 16 years. All the while, he headed the Department andwas the dean for the first four years. The main thing is what he wanted in those positions - along with their colleagues was to lay and develop the traditions of the classical university, university atmosphere of the faculty and the university. The major scientific issues that are developed by V.A. Kitaev were: the history of liberalism and the fate of liberal reforms (modernization) in Russia, the history of the Russian conservative thought, the problem of revolutionary violence as an inevitable result of the practical realization of socialist ideas. As an advocate of "establishing full-fledged liberal order", V.A. Kitaev had, in essence, to ascertain: in Russia XIX - early XX century did not yet develop the historical conditions for the triumph of liberal ideas. The weakness and indecision of Russian liberals and their fear of the revolutionary movement, the constant fluctuation between the reform and reaction did not allow them to become independent of the political force that would determine the fate of the country in the end.

AB In the paper a short review of the basic problems in studying the regional science and higher education system in their connection with the main all-Russian historical tendencies is presented. Here we consider the role of the Siberian science and higher education (system of preparation of highly-skilled personnel) in the economic development of Siberia (broader - the so-called ''internal colonisation''), in sociocultural region development, and in general for the country modernisation processes. Besides, for the deeper analysis of internal logic of the research object evolution the concept ''centre-peripheral'' relations in the science organisation system is involved. The most significant stages in respect of new knowledge reception as priority directions of the further methodological and concrete historical scientific search are designated. The authors' conclusions emphasise the specific place and role of Siberia in the critical epoch connected with forced renewal of interrupted modernisation of the first half of the 20th century. The analysis of the major factors and features of state modernisation accompanied by the ongoing colonisation of the vast region allowed to reveal the second important subject - scientific, technical and teaching personnel. We make an attempt to verbalise the socio-political and socio-cultural roles played by the local scientific and pedagogical community in these processes. The description presented on the basis of the system analysis of the basic pluses and minuses of the system of science and higher education in Siberia, its main achievements, revealing the reasons of its failures allow to draw a basic conclusion that the development of the regional scientific-educational complex, first of all, was caused by the objective problems that both the state and the region (if to consider it as a certain geosocial whole) faced. Thus, the main contradiction slowing further development and application of the scientific-educational potential accumulated by the region was the lack of mechanisms of independent self-control, statement and solution of perspective tasks, transregional integration caused by hypercentralisation of management and redistribution of economic and personnel resources, characteristic for the science and higher education management system that had been formed by the end of the stated period.

DE political socialization; historical memory; national identity; identity
   crisis; political images; political symbols
AB The article deals with the role of historical memory in the process of national identification. The analysis is based on the idea of national identity as at the same time of social and cultural phenomenon and a product of deliberate design. The article states the presence in Russia of an unsurmounted until today identity crisis, which affected first of all the young generation of Russians.
   The identity crisis, which took place in Russia in the 90-s destroyed the system of values and symbols dominating in the society without giving anything to replace this system. The crisis destroyed not only the structure of rational values and standards dominating the society, but also the system of traditional cultural symbols and stereotypes laid down in it. In search of the new identities one looks into history, which becomes the existential space, where persons and groups try to find their own identities, the new meaning of life, the new base for identification with the society. Mythologized historical events serve as symbols of the historical myths, which become at the same time the base for forming and the mode of existence of new cultural, social and political communities.
   The investigation shows that the process of national identification as a significant part of political socialization should not be accepted as spontaneous. If any social or political institutions did not propose the young generation positive symbols which could help them to identify themselves as citizens of the state and accept the adequate system of political values, in these circumstances they spontaneously find a lot of negative ones. These negative symbols born in mass consciousness are taken by some political actors, publicized by mass media and thus become means for the manipulation of political orientations and mass political behavior.
   In conclusion the author declares the need for state historical policy whose images and symbols could contribute to the process of self-identification of the young Russian citizen.

DE image of the municipal authority; websites of the municipal
   administrations; verbal and visual channels forming the image of power
AB Municipal authorities are a relatively new institution in the Russian system of power relations, separate from traditional government institutions and designed to solve local problems. The significance of the formation of the image of the municipal authority, sufficient in terms of modern legal provisions, is actualized due to the fact that in the minds of citizens, this institution is associated with the state authority. This idea was formed thanks to Soviet organization of the political system and remains strong among both citizens and municipal employees. Today, the image of power is generated by the media and means of mass communication through verbal and visual channels. Another increasingly important medium in shaping the image of power is the Internet, which provides opportunities for interactive intersubjectivity communications. Local Authorities are also included in this process: many municipal administrations have launched official websites, which are designed to inform the public about its activities, to provide certain services and establish two-way communication between the authorities and the population.
   In order to determine the effectiveness with which official municipal websites in Bashkortostan represented local authorities, in January 2012 the Research Center at the Bashkir Academy of Public Administration and Management under the President of the Republic of Bashkortostan examined the content and navigation of municipal sites. The main parameters of the analysis followed the verbal (i.e. site content) and visual channels for generating the image of power.
   The study identified and analyzed the two major information and communication technologies used on a site: the "flow" of power (general information on the activities of municipal authorities), and selected "shapes" from the background (information about the municipal manager - head of administration). The results of the analysis showed a predominance of the informational component over the communicative, which reduces the level of interest in the site. They also revealed a formal approach to the design of news blocks, such that for most municipalities, site content does not reflect the real needs and expectations of the local population. There was a clear lack of information on the socio-economic decisions of the authorities and the local community. Thus, the channel forming the image of the municipal government fails to satisfy both the demands of the population and those of municipal employees and their managers. The most popular forms of communication between power and citizens remain largely the same, especially in rural areas: personal contacts and on-paper communication. This significantly reduces the opportunities for the authorities to present their image through the Internet. It seems this channel will be needed in the future, when the majority of the population will prefer social networking to "classic media" - television, radio, newspaper.

DE Siberian regionalism; ideology; identity; traditionalism
AB This publication is set affiliation regionalism in political ideologies. It is known that ideology serves complex social-political phenomenon that connects the spiritual and practical production. In essence, ideology always focused on the bottom line. It should be noted that even the leaders of the movement have repeatedly noted oblastnicheskogo practical orientation of their ideologi calviews.
   Drawing attention to the pressing problems of the Siberian region (abolition of political exile, the construction of roads, development of education, the extermination of the indigenous population of the region, and many others), GN Potanin, NM Yadrintsev determined that the essence of all problems lies in establishing a "proper" relationship between the center and the periphery. This cements the idea of playing a certain ideological core of regionalism. Moreover, this central tenet of ideology Siberian patriots lined up in a theoretical construct only of the practical and the observed needs of the region. In a meaningful context oblastnicheskaya ideology was precisely designed to develop local self-consciousness, without which national and regional identity. Another inherent characteristic in determining regionalism as an ideology is to develop some understanding of the social and political reality, inherent in all belief systems, qualifying as an ideology. Looks more convincing than the ideal image (understanding) of reality, the ideology is recognized more slender. In regionalism, by the way, in this respect, it was a "local issue" and local patriotism. Common understanding of reality possible only through the prism of known principles "to the center of the province," "from the particular to the whole," "from the concrete to the abstract." In general, the paper shows that the nature of the teaching of the classics deologicheskaya democratic regionalism expressed in the practical orientation of this conceptual scheme. This ideology is aimed at introducing into the mass consciousness of certain evaluation criteria of the past, present and future, as a solid basis of group identity. Implication of regionalism to ideologies illustrates the style of thinking promoted by the ideology of regionalism, which excludes any manifestations of nationalism and cosmopolitanism. Symbolic aspect, expressed in the concept of Free Siberia gives regionalism as an ideology and the continued relevance of the demand these days.

DE image of power; perception of power; subjects of power;
   ethno-territorial factor; electoral preferences
AB Understanding the basics of choosing a particular leader, a political force is traditionally an important research field of political psychology. National studies on the subject are focused on the correlation between the preferences of citizens and certain characteristics, such as age, social status, belonging to particular religious or ethnic groups. The significance of this problem is associated not only with understanding of the electoral structure of society and its relation to ethno-territorial map of Russia, but also with the ability to resolve ethnic conflicts by identifying shared basic political values of different ethnic and regional groups. Thus, the general discontent with policies can simultaneously indicate reckless political decisions in the country, as well as shared values, which may be the beginning of integration of a multi-ethnic society.
   Recent studies focus on perception of politicians and political parties in such ethnic groups as Russians, Tatars, Bashkirs, Ossetians. It turned out that, of course, some differences among different ethnic groups are present, which can be explained by the different types of political culture and mentality. However, what's more important at the time of the political choice are socio-economic factors, particularities of local political institutions and their effectiveness. The cause of psychological problems, which is the result of technical development of regions, is the cognitive basis of political preferences.
   Support of individual leaders and political parties in each ethnic group corresponds to those in other groups. At the same time, Russian respondents have not been separated in their responses, in general, their opinion coincides with the Tatars', Bashkirs' and Ossetians'. The opinion of close ethnic groups of Tatars and Bashkirs, in some cases, out of tune in the selection of priority values. This means that our society, despite of the ethnic conflict, is not a conflict structure, consisting of two poles: "Russians" and "non-Russians". The same preferences of Russians and other ethnic groups, and different preferences among Tatars, Bashkirs and Ossetians suggest that under the new election cycle we see the split "Russian - not Russian.

DE political psychology; political perception; images of political
   institutions; parliament
AB Since Ch. Montesquieu described the concept of separation of powers it became unconditional value for political science theory and determined the appreciation of stable functioning legislative branch as a basic instrument and condition of democracy process. If political experts regard this concept as a norm of political science then Russian citizens' attitude to legislative powers in general and its institutions particularly isn't clear. Russian sociologists researches indicate that about half of citizens don't trust State Duma actions and about third part of them are sure that the parliament as institution is not necessary for political system.
   The current image of Russian parliament is determined by contextual, communicative and psychological factors such as: in Russian political culture there are no reference representations of separation of powers; legislative actions changed the configuration of political system; negative image in media as dependent institution with predictable actions and others.
   In the research of sociology and psychology of politics branch of political science department of Lomonosov Moscow State University we received the next results. On the rational level citizens do not mention legislative institutions spontaneously in political power system description. In focused questions about place and functions of legislative powers in political system we noticed that in public opinion there is mixed knowledge and understanding of roles of State Duma, its' reference and really executed functions. On the unconscious level - in the projective test "Drawing" - the legislative institutions appear in drawings describing power as system and structure with objects and connections. The typical image of parliament institutions - they are placed below the president and executive power institutions, near but without connections (or with connections through other institutions).
   These data from researches of power perception and political mentality shows that topic demands additional research with focused methodology.

AB Many researchers claim that during last several months the political situation in the country has changed. Political apathy and reluctance to participation in politics have been replaced by political and street activity, demonstrated even by people who have traditionally been far from politics (young people, people with the above average income level). And at the same time we should notice that actually no explicit changes (decline) of the situation happened. People going out to the meetings at prospect Saharova, Bolotnaya square in Moscow demonstrated unwillingness to bear with the situation, first of all its political side (We should notice that people didn't express any economical demands contrary to Greece for example). And the old claim heard from V. Tsoi in 90-s "We are waiting for changes" has again become actual for many citizens of our country. People's attitude towards political power has changed, and results of the research confirm it. In the project Political mentality, the power unit was analyzed.
   Compared to the power evaluation during Putin's period negative evaluations of the modern power increased significantly: 54% of the respondents expressed their negative opinion and only 10% were positive
   Many researchers of public opinion say that currently data of the quantitative polls do not quite reflect the real picture because the ratings of Putin and Medvedev are quite stable. As the results of our research show the evaluations of the regime are not that favorable, it is accused of not being able to solve the problems that the society is facing at the moment, corruption, irresponsibility (not fulfillment of the promises), being detached from the people. This excessive criticism is a quite dangerous trend. People are not ready to go out to the rally/ protest but they are interested in situation to change.

   Modern political parties refused from the produce real values. The content of the party's ideology is built in accordance with the need to solve the immediate problem of obtaining and retaining power. Analyzing the current state of the party's ideology in Russia, researchers use the term "manipulative ideologies", focusing on their technological functions.
   In the minds of the most Russians the image of the party forms in general, rather than its political program. Political psychologists' study show that the images of Russian political parties are vague and uncertain.
   For the study of political values in the structure of the party's ideology is necessary to distinguish them from such cognitive constructs as political views and ideas.

DE political psychology; state image; transformation
AB The study of characteristics of formation of state image in mass political consciousness is one of the most topical trend of research in Russian politic-psychology. Such interest is fully appropriate because a state is the fundamental of society which is controlling and regulating all basic spheres of human life.
   Creation of this image presumes that an individual gets different signals from external environment and then cognitively processes the received information. We point out several important factors which play the key role in formation of state image in mass political consciousness of Russian citizens.
   First of all we are interested in the new Russian state formation as an object of perception in post soviet period. The process of transformation is combined with multiple changes both in political, social and economical spheres and in people's minds. Such processes as changing of political course, system of values, foreign-policy priorities became a part of citizen's everyday life. This created a situational context for perception of the state image. People's civil reaction to those events, acceptance or rejection of reforms and their attitude to the new state power, which was personified with the new state, can be explained with political culture which emerged in Russia for centuries. Therefore political culture and situational context create another factor of forming of state image - the political context.
   Over the past 20 years the mass media increased its influence on public opinion. Now it is not a source of information only, but a powerful political-psychological mechanism which can seriously transform the political consciousness of citizens. For this reason the mass media is one of the most important parts of another communication factor that influences the formation of state image.

DE Political ratings; political leaders; Russia; Vladimir Putin; Dmitry
   Medvedev
AB The principle of complementarity of information obtained in the course of mass polls and focus groups provides reliable data about the attitude of people to political leaders, and permits to avoid typical drawbacks of these methods and limitations. The practice of using political ratings for public opinion manipulation, especially during election campaigns, is widely known. Political ratings as evaluation of political actors, institutions or events, obtained through focus group polls at a particular time and expressed in percentages or scores, provides important information about political preferences of different social groups. Not only individual evaluation may be presented as a rating (for example, 65% of respondents positively rated activity of politicians), but the list of objects of political evaluation, expressed in scores, places and percentages (for example, the rating of references to politicians in mass media). Technology of ratings based on public opinion polls is the use of direct questions to obtain information on preference of a political actor or an institution. With different question formulation in respect of the same politician there are different results.
   According to the data of "Political Petersburg" - the project of The Center for Empirical Political Studies of The Faculty of Political Science, St. Petersburg State University, in 2011 estimates, made by Petersburgers on a 5-point scale, of activities of Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev are almost identical: 55% of respondents rated both politicians at "4" and "5" to. In 2012 activity of Putin was rated at "4" and "5" by 53.4%, "1" and "2" - 16%, "3" - 23.3%. Dmitry Medvedev for his work was given "4" and "5" by 44.5% of the respondents, "3" - 29.9%, "1" and "2" - 20%.
   Results of a series of focus groups (study in Leningrad Region, July-August 2011, more than 20 focus groups in 8 districts of Leningrad Region, both in regional cities, small towns and rural areas; the criterion for participants was their age (up to 45 years, older than 45 years); all social groups were represented in the sample) showed that attitude to Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin differentiated from the extreme degree of acceptance to absolutely fierce criticism, which was connected with the overall evaluation of affairs in the country, the sources of political information used by respondents, the level of personal social well-being. The most important criterion of attitude to federal executive power, personified in the images of the president and the prime minister, is a subjective evaluation of presence or lack of the authorities' efforts to improve life quality of citizens of the Russian Federation. Some respondents believe that motivation of the head of the state and the prime minister is aimed not only at solving their personal financial problems, but has open anti-state character. In the minds of ordinary respondents the "president - prime minister" tandem is united and has common purposes, unity of ideas on the development of Russia, and therefore the attitude to D. Medvedev is transferred to V. Putin and vice versa. Respondents did not separate functions of the executive power of federal and regional levels. They have extremely negative attitude to a principle of "manual management" of the country, because this style of activity demonstrates inefficiency of the management system of the state in general. Respondents do not see any alternative to V. Putin and D. Medvedev since "the field of politics" is cleansed.

AB In this article there is analyzed the problem of making political decisions in the context of psychological realistic criteria, that are of instrumental character and are being an open system of binary oppositions. When a politician acquires such psycological tools, he also gets reflexive forms of training and an ability of making different political decisions, Realistic criteria serve as subjective standard by which a politician judges to what extent he is willing to make sensible decisions. Criteria proposed by the author give us a reflective example of the process of psychological regulation. Sustainable learning and efficient use of the assimilation system of binary oppositions contribute to the increasing of the reflexive capacity and the level of politician's subjectivity. Purposeful formation of all mentioned characteristics through the described concept is possible to be considered as an important task of proper psychological training for decision-makers.

DE political mentality; the peoples of the North Caucasus; factors forming
   the mentality
AB At the present time The North Caucasus is concentrated by the attention of Russia and the whole world. This region is a unique phenomenon where more than a hundred indigenous ethnic groups are located. This region is characterized by the intertwining of national and global trends with regional specifics. To understand this region is through the study of the political mentality of the peoples living here. Because politics and the institute of power are the objects on which directed the attention of the people.
   As we concerned It should be make a definition of the political mentality, as in the Humanities there are many approaches to understanding of the essence of political mentality. Each of the approaches interprets a certain aspect of the mentality of the peoples.
   Taking into account that the political mentality is part of the mentality as a whole, but pertaining to the political sphere, we offer to make the following definition: the political mentality - it is part of the General mentality of the individual, the team, the company, which is a system-forming basis, the determinant of the political culture; it is part of the General mentality, which contains the common views, attitudes, and values in the political sphere; it is a value the picture of the world, perceived through the prism of the policy; this is a subjective image of the political reality and peculiar form of his awareness.
   Contrasting to the political culture, political mentality is the internal political world of the people, due to its geographical location, customs, traditions, religion, in a while political culture is the external manifestation of the internal feelings of a particular social group about the political reality.
   To understand the mentality of one or another social group we should consider what factors influence its formation. In the case of the North Caucasus we look at a few basic factors:
   - socio-economic factors;
   - demographic factor- the religious factor;
   - traditions and customs;
   - the territorial-geographical (relief).
   Under the influence of such factors in Caucasians formed a special mentality with peculiar socio-cultural, moral and political components. Its main features are in the clan system, isolation, mutual agreement, the power of traditional authorities, the priority of national, religious customs before the laws of the state.

AB The paper presents the findings of a study of socio-professional status and professionalization of Russian homeopaths. Homeopaths are considered as a professional group, which since the late 1980s follows the path of the institutionalization within Russian healthcare system, alongside with other methods of alternative medicine. Despite the official recognition of the homeopathic method and the development of the homeopathic market, homeopaths position in medical community remains ambiguous. As a methodological framework for the study of social and professional status of homoeopaths were used resource approach and the concepts developed in studies of occupational groups. We analyzed four types of resources - economic, powerful, cultural and social. In so doing, special attention was paid to the professional autonomy as an indicator of power resource group.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Development of modem political science demands the appeal to the analysis of microlevel of policy. For development of this direction there were the philosophical and gnoseological preconditions, allowing to describe a concept of a political world view.
   The author allocated some directions of conceptualization of a political world view. The first direction is connected with the analysis of the vital world and the philosophical bases of essence of the political. The author refers philosophical and gnoseological interpretations of a world view to the second direction. The third direction - judgment of a world view in separate social and the humanities.
   Basic for creation of a theoretical concept of a political world view of steel political H.Arendt's communicative and activity treatment, phenomenology A. Schutz and E. Husserl, theories of "a sensual and semantic kernel" M.Merlo-Ponti.
   The political world view is defined as mobile system of images and ideas of the power and policy, its structure, mechanisms and a configuration in the surrounding reality, reflecting the political world. The political world view grows out of an interiorization of the political world as parts of the vital world in individual and collective consciousness. The structure of a political world view is made by the visual and cognitive images organized in multilevel system in system of coordinates of space and time: ontologic level (kernel of a political world view) contains symbolical images of the power and the state (Homeland); basic level - images of elements of the political world and idea of ways of communication between them; the tool includes ideas of possible models for the subject of political behavior.
   Problems of conceptualization of a political world view are allocated.

AB The article deals with the unique possibilities of university cities external positioning. The study has been conducted in the context of the predictable reduction of cities in quantity, both in Europe and in Russia, and the survival struggle when city brand becomes the most important resource. Speaking of a university city, the successful area brand promotion is supposed to take into account the most important components such as image marketing, sightseeing marketing, and personality marketing. The author reveals the role of past, present, and future in the effective positioning and the socialization of the students coming to the university city. Special attention is paid to the visual policy as it precedes direct contact, shapes reality perception, and evokes the atmosphere of city and citizen unity. University city visual policy doesn't come to the perception of the past as a museum exhibit; memory is an active catalyst of the present mastering and the future planning.

AB This paper contains the results of a pilot study of presidential candidates' perception after 2012 campaign. Their images went through transformation in half a year that passed after elections. Thus electoral campaign permitted to clarify political views of the Presidential candidates/ All of them except G.Zjuganov managed to improve their perception. The winner of the race V.V. Putin reached his historical maximum of this parameter in November 2012.
   One should mention that on a rational level of Putin's perception dynamics in comparison with a pre-electoral period of all three components of his image, i.e. strength, attractiveness and activeity is positive. At the same time a number of negative elements that were absent before, appeared in his image. The swings in unconscious level of Putin's perception are also rather salient. After election his leader's status became more visible. The feature of aggressiveness the are perceived quite positively by our citizens became also very important.
   Thus electoral victory on one hand strengthen Putin's formal status, clarified his views to public, made his image more attractive as a politician but on the other hand for the first time it for the first time produced doubts in solidness of his positions. It is not probable that in nearest future his tendencies in his perception can shake his power, but it is evident that such state of the society will necessitate him and his team a lot of attempts to fulfill his electoral promises and react on the peoples' demand for more just and integral politics.

DE image of the political leader; political perception; factors
AB The political situation in the late 2011 - early 2012, accompanied by increased political activity of the masses, the unfolding debate about changing of the institution of parliamentary elections and the formation of governors in Russia, suggest the possibility of significant changes within political perceptions of the citizens.
   While preparing this report, we have used research's results of Presidential images in election of 2012. This research was conducted at the Department of Sociology and Political Psychology and in a qualitative nature. In addition, data of its own research image of the ideal political leader was included.
   The results of research support the hypothesis that every political leader has his own core around which is built by one thing - it's ideological and political components, for another - moral, ethical and subjective principles, for the third - his personal and psychological quality, the last one are becoming more and more powerful. Research of this image on a rational level that indicates that shows that there is no universal answer to the question of what the ideal leader should be. On the one hand, respondents want to see determination and the ability to go beyond the rules (lines proactive style), on the other hand, they actively support such features as conservatism - loyalty to the cause, the ability to foresee the circumstances, endurance, flexibility. Image of the ideal leader of the research at unconscious level suggests the presence in minds of the Russians desire to increase popular participation in the political process. There are concerns of the problem of corruption in the Russian style of leadership, his or her inactivity, archaic, shady character, isolation from people.
   The results indicate that the images of political leader at the moment are under constant changes, due to the intensity of the impact of individual factors. For the review of the Russian presidential race in 2012 among them are such factors as: personal characteristics and actions of the politician and his or her rivals, particularly the role of the President, the political culture, the event context, the state of mass consciousness and communicative aspects of the election campaign.

AB Before and after the 2012 presidential election, journalists and experts continue active discussions about longevity of the Putin-Medvedev tandem, pre-election change of the highest posts in the country, and contradictory forecasts as to how close their cooperation is going to be within the framework of the current configuration of power. The unwavering focus on the relations between Putin and Medvedev is quite clear as the effectiveness of the nation's governance depends on who is in the tandem - partners or rivals. Although the leaders are not always unanimous in their views on domestic and international politics, which is quite natural, they, however, tend to shun confrontation.
   In my research I employ the methods of psychobiography, case studies, and content analysis of spontaneous speeches and abstract from mass media materials and forecasts of political analysts, which allows me to make impartial judgements about leadership features of Putin and Medvedev and consider the impact of their personalities on the political activity within the tandem.
   The research has shown that each of the politicians has a complex I-concept that lets him respond to challenging and intricate situations with discretion, for the common good, for the national interest. Although Putin and Medvedev belong to two consecutive generations, their personal and political socialization ran in different situations. They were affected by similar agents and institutions of socialization but in different combinations and to different degrees. With strategically similar goals certain differences in their operational code reveal differences in their tactics. Medvedev sides with international economic integration and diplomatic manoeuvres, while Putin strives to step up the might of the Russian defence and political-military consolidation with allies. Differences in their motivation profiles and the absence of power dominant let them view the effectiveness of their activity in their own way and build up their teams to their own liking, - governmental and presidential, respectively. However, neither of them would fight for supremacy, believing that his status in the public mind is the result of his hard work.
   The research thus shows that the alliance of Putin and Medvedev is based on their personal compatibility, closeness of values, and readiness to share political responsibility. This is why their tandem-bound cooperation may well be viable and promising.

DE political psychology; civic identity; political consciousness; political
   representation
AB Under the circumstances of urgent need for acquiring new political principles that integrate heterogeneous Russian society in a unified concept of the nation and the state, interest in the problem of Russian identity is determined by serious challenges of everyday life, including the preservation of the integrity of the state, the localization of its political and cultural influence. Particularly topical becomes the study of identity in a multicultural environment, characterized by a multilevel and multi-political consciousness of citizens.
   The process of self-identification of the North Caucasus people is significantly affected by the factors of everyday events, that causes distortion of the whole system of notions. The study of psychological mechanisms of civil identification, definition of the place and role of the key components of political consciousness - notions about the country, state and country of residence, images of "us" and "others" through which comes the identificational choice of the average Caucasian, is the challenge of the modern period.
   In this context, of course, comes the suggestion that the specificity of identification construction (localization of notions, ethnicization, narrowing the social space to "our" region) is a fertile ground for updating the system of differences in the mechanisms of formation and sometimes for the crisis deformation of identities of Southern Russia residents.
   Research of the components of political consciousness, perception of "Russia" and "Country of Residence" by the citizens of the national-territorial entities in Russia is carried out by the staff of Department of Sociology and Political Psychology of the Faculty of Politology of the MSU under the project "Russian nation-state identity" in years 2006-2012.
   Thereby the formation of their political identity can be examined in logic from the point of three alternatives. The first alternative - the loyal all-Russian civil identity that in case of crisis becomes a starting point of frustration processes in the minds of inhabitants of the North Caucasus in the modern period. The second alternative - the negative civil identity replaced by regional identity. The second oneconsists of a set of ideas of the Russian state created in twothousandyears within denial of the Russian identity based onactualizing of some symbolical components of local and ethnic identityagainst the background of feeling of "offensiveness" and "forlornness" of the small people. The third alternative - synthesis of ideas of the Russian state, the country, patriotism and citizenshipand the realization of being united with a number of the traditional representations, popular local and ethnic identity.

DE political perception; authority; image of authority
AB Today the political process, on the one hand, is very predictable that become a reason of low level of political participation, and, on the other hand, it's unpredictable that is reason of two processes - strengthening the legitimacy of government and rising discontent and protests. It's interesting to know whether the "authority-obedience" relation in the modem political process.
   When we know how people perceive the power, we can define the main subjects of authority and the boundaries of authority; we can imagine the picture of "authority". Obedience is one of the mechanisms of knowledge of the authority. If the political development of the state is higher, then the possibility to use mechanisms of violence and compulsion is lower.
   The low level of political participation and the high level of legitimacy cause modem political perception which based on cognitive dissonance in politics. Today the political perception in Russia bases on rational knowledge of political process, but mass consciousness saves characteristics of political patemalism in socio-psychological and economic spheres.
   These findings show the high level of recognition of authority by Russian citizens. The citizens recognize the authority as necessary aspect of life. This Tendency is based on mental features (peculiarities) and political culture, as a result of feeling distrustful of authority citizens recognize the prevailing position of political power and all its positive and negative capabilities.
   We can conclude that Russian citizens perceive the authority such as united, strong state machine, which should be at a consensus with society and laws like a guarantor this consensus. The laws define the new behavioral practices and it establishes equality; the recognition the judicial system of state enshrines in it the legitimacy of power.

DE internet; internet-communication; political views; social networks
AB The problem of studying the Internet as a new form of modern political communication is relevant to contemporary political science. Currently, the influence of the Internet on the mass consciousness of the people is carried out by forming a new political reality in which induces the production of a type of political views, rather than those which are available for people who do not have access to modern internet communications.
   In the course of the study the author possible to draw some conclusions:
   First, the emergence of the Internet as a means of mass communication has changed the nature of perception and processing of incoming information to a citizen of the world;
   Second, the process of transformation occurring features of mass communication with the advent of the Internet have greatly expanded resources group bringing people together in various community and contributed to the creation of such a thing as social media - media that combines specific groups that are most subject to the concept of specialized audience. within these core audience, creating their own virtual reality;
   Third, we can say that it is not the reality shows in our minds and creates various forms of social and political activity of citizens, as prevailing in the social network is largely simulyakraticheskie political views dictate the ability of the political behavior of the citizens, putting them at the mercy of the virtual reality prevailing in today's Internet communication;
   Fourthly, it is possible to state that the political views generated by modern technologies of Internet communications, radically different from the political views of citizens who are not involved in political communication through new forms. Create an online communication reality is beginning to dominate the minds of Internet users and can even determine the coordinates, which are formed in the virtual reality, are an important catalytic force for them;
   Fifth, online communication helps build community. Of the community updated certain national sentiments are aired by the Network. The result is the exit to the street people and their willingness to hold demonstrations against the government.
   Sixth, there are two main blog representing oppositional content and content that comes from the government. According to opposition website content is more effective. This is confirmed by the number of people who went to street rallies on Bolotnaya Square, Sakharov Avenue and other meetings.

AB Today the problem of transformation of modern mass consciousness of Russian citizens is actual and is discussed in scientific community. The author in article analyzes the processes of change occurring in public moods of citizens of contemporary Russia in last years, which updated the protest moods in the mass consciousness of the Russian society in 2012.
   The article dealt specific transformation of political representation of citizens which in 1990th were characterized by a sharp polarization in the different generational groups of estimations of activity of the Russian power, which determined the existence of "split" type of the Russian mass consciousness and identify features of the dynamics of contemporary social attitudes of Russian citizens, contribute to the manifestation of protest forms of political activity in 2012.
   As part of the article analyzes the political and psychological portrait of the mood of protest groups of citizens, which motivate the participation not consent with a present political policy of the Russian power in a proceeding wide wave of meetings, as well as the reasons for the protest activity of the masses. It is noted that the specificity of the political socialization of people in contemporary Russia is characterized by that there is a stratification of three opposition is socializing waves connected with the events of a present protest wave, protest Perestroika and protest "Children of the Arbat" and if the average nurtures parents generation has 20 years, it is not accidental it turns out that the peaks of the protest rallies activity in our country are repeated at intervals of about 20 years: 1960th - years of "thaw", perestroika 1980th - early 1990th and present has begun 10th of XXI century. Based on this premise, the conclusion about not casual character of present protest activity of the masses and that the protest will be a significant trend in the mass consciousness of citizens of Russia for some time.
   Conducted as part of this article, the analysis showed that for the initial post-Soviet mass consciousness was characterized by a mosaic type of consciousness of a mixture of communist and neoliberal and nationalist-patriotic views of society for the future development of the country, which is largely stratified by generational split, the younger generation is oriented more to the Western neoliberal values of personal freedom and civil rights, the older generation has seen a return to a stable existence in his address to the Soviet experience of the communist past, and the average generation forked to those who were able to adapt to the post-Soviet Russian life, sharing their most Western values, contribute to improving the their lives and those who adapt, could not, and increasingly turned to the national-patriotic views, now segmentation of the mass consciousness of Russians is not by generation, but because "for" or "against" you're an existing political power, no matter to what social group they belong to.

DE institutions; ratings; comparative analysis; panel regression
AB Ratings that assess the quality of institutions is widely used in the scientific literature. Among them there are those who were perfected for decades. All these ratings are used to peer review ranking countries. The authors believe that these estimates are fundamentally incompatible and therefore not applicable for the comparative analysis in a single time point of observation. A group of variables, which are used in assessment of "political" institutions only for the presence or absence of a particular phenomenon is offered. Such a kit is suitable for the variable cross-sectional analysis. A rating based on a combination of the proposed variables is considered. The use of panel regression can alleviate the problem of poor compatibility expert estimates.

DE Tomsk region; parliamentarism; Duma
AB After the Soviet system was abolished a necessity to form new power institutions in the subjects of the federation appeared. These new bodies were supposed to be built on principles of federalism and parliamentarism. Only general framework of regional electoral campaign and basic principles of functioning of parliamentary institutions was established on the federal level so the creation of rules regulating that field in different regions was very active. Parliamentary regulations in the subjects of the Russian Federation were similar to each other in their general concepts but had some regional features. The State Duma of Tomsk Region consisted of 21 deputies elected in single-member districts under majority system. By the elections of December 21, 1997 electoral districts became binomial. Political organizations, representatives of industry, science and education participated in the election to the first and the second Dumas of Tomsk Region (March 27, 1994 and December 21, 1997). Political parties were relatively passive and their performance was not very successful. It seems that one of the reasons political organizations had rather poor results at regional election is that electorate tends to be not ideologically but pragmatically oriented voting for regional power bodies. As a consequence the major part of elected deputies were representatives of industrial organizations and executive power institutions. There were a lot of positive results of the Duma's activity (1994-2001): it was able to create basic laws in different fields of economic, political and social life, which was a big achievement considering that deputies started their work in an almost complete legal vacuum. The basic directions of further work were developed; the deputies managed to pass The Statute of Tomsk Region on July 26, 1995. The turnout at the election of 1997 was higher than in 1994 which showed the increase of the Duma's political influence. However, some negative trends could be displayed as well. Creation of the law was still behind the real life demands, some very important legal rules (for example, in economic field) were not created; most of the acts passed by the Duma were initiated by region executive institutions; participation of the representatives of economic and political elite in the electoral campaign made it more difficult for less wealthy candidates to get into the Duma; voters rarely participated in discussions of bills. Nevertheless, the important thing is that regional parliament was formed, it was able to create and pass laws that were essential for the whole region and the Duma became an important part of regional political system.

ID CONSTANTINE PORPHYROGENITUS; CROATS
AB The article discusses the passage from the 291 chapter of the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus'. treatise De administrando imperio (c. 950) Where is reported of how archontes, that are those who had hereditary: power status, replaced so-called zupanoi-elders. who previously headed early Slavic societies in the Balkans. It was this information that was often considered a key evidence in favor of presumed stadiality of the development of Slavic social organization transformed from originally acephalous society (the zupanoi period) to a politically organized society in which there existed a princely power (the archontes period). The author raises a question to what extent the interpretation of this passagc from the perspective of social evolution was determined by the information of the source itself, and by the theoretical context of current ideas about the nature of early Slavic society. Having exainined the passage in the context of Constantine Porphyrogenitus' perception of the early history of the Serbs and Croats, the author concludes that the passage on zupanoi and arhontes is not only ideologically motivated constmction. In the case of this passage we deal with one of the first theoretical explanations of social evolution in barbarian society. The explanation proposed by the emperor looks so plausible and logical that harmonizes with current theories of acephalous society and secondary: state formation. Meanwhile, the author argues, the real social development of early Slavic society was much more complex.

DE City; "The other"; linearity; nonlinearity
AB At the beginning of the XX century the science entered the term "nonlinearity" into philosophical language, borrowing it from the theory of the nonlinear differential equations. Formation of scientific ideas of nonlinearity of the world represents difficult process. Nonlinearity recognition in a modem scientific picture of the world allowed to carry out revolutionary change of a way of thinking, outlook, methodology of a modem science. Nonlinearity as concept, becomes the synergetic basis which concept was formulated in scientific works I. Prigozhina Increasing every year scientific by the importance of nonlinear processes, affected development of philosophical thought, leading to emergence of new philosophy of a science. In the concept of new philosophy the City as the phenomenon, embodies a picture of the world and its contradiction. Till New time the City was perceived as the finished, artificially created linear system. The come-out assumption is confirmed by the cities - the projects reflecting linearity of space in geometry of buildings, streets, park ensembles. Linearity of life of the City was supported by the law which was not allowing chaos and a disorder. However the linear thinking can work only in limited space. Thus only in nonlinear system the City could develop, show dynamically resistance to external threat, suppress multiactivity of the intracity system consisting of Town council, Guilds, Church, University. Therefore, the City phenomenon which has arisen as linear system eventually without losing linearity, is perceived as nonlinear system, creating stability of a phenomenon of the City which is at the same time combining elements of nonlinear and linear systems. Defining a place of "the other" by consideration of a phenomenon of the City we address to the term "deconstruction". The deconstruction defines movement of experience which appears waiting "the other" and is given to expectation of "the other". "The other" irrespective of linear or nonlinear space of the City, expresses an essence of "new experience", modem vision of the world lying in a design. Finding a known duality peculiar to metaphysical thinking, "the other" reconstructs the concepts "subjekt Ya". By means of "Another", comprehension of "other ego" is carried out. The city megalopolis generates experiences of fear of death. Voluntary acceptance "loneliness with " the other" becomes rescue. Depersonalized "the other" is necessary to the City and its inhabitants not to lose "new experience" which it is possible to transfer, without entering corporal contact. Virtual, depersonalized "the other" deprived of a corporality being interwoven into a web of city lines, fills emptiness of space, creating deceptive illusion of human communication.

The authors aim to strengthen two beginnings in the students: 1) structurally ordered thinking; 2) ego-oriented attitude of the student to the own Master thesis, i.e. perception of the thesis on an intersection of scientific cognition tradition and attempt of the student self-realization. The methods have "provocative" character: the aim of such management is decided under pretext of undergraduates adaptation to the standards of a professional behavior. For development structurally ordered thinking of the student the authors recommend the trained a plane of the report by results of researches and structure of Master thesis. It stimulates the student to reflex above the contents and methods of its researches. Similarly, the authors explain to the student genre features and structures of scientific judgment which is carried out on a defense in Master thesis. Besides the authors have developed 18 creative (problem) tasks appropriate to three cycles of seminars: 1) "Master thesis as a cultural sample"; 2) "Master thesis as fruits of my creative labor and a subject of selfcriticism"; 3) "Master thesis as a driver of my withdrawal from a condition of ignorantia juvenilis". These tasks force the student to analyze a sense and level of own researches outcomes, looking on them through a prism of submissions about regularities of creativity and prognosises of natural sciences the next 20-50 years.

AB In the article the problem of a specific character and value humanitarian components of knowledge management in modem conditions is considered. The importance of this topic is caused by globalization and its influence on economic, political, social and cultural changes firstly, and dehumanitarization i.e. decrease of humanities value in modern Russian higher school, secondly. The subject of analysis is the higher education (content and the principles) and technologies of knowledge management in the globalization conditions. First of all, the necessity of cultural studies of the globalization is pointed. Thus, in the humanities area of attention there are new strategy of the person behaviour and activity, new levels of management and forecasting, new type of the person. "The person of the globalization epoch" is characterized by skill to adapt for variations of social, cultural and the information environment, capacity to form relations on principles of respect, openness and tolerance, readiness for constant self-development. New humanitarian paradigm, integrating results of various disciplines in comprehension of the global world realities and called up to define the person's world-view in the XXI century, is able to form such qualities.
   Among the most important ideological components of this paradigm innovation strategy of continuous education takes especial place. Realization of this educational strategy, as a way of the mankind problems decision and as the basis of social and cultural progress, requires the development of new knowledge management technologies. Knowledge management should stimulate cognitive activity of the person and develop his professional and personal competences. The key position in this process belongs to humanitarian education which tasks include not only "transfer" of knowledge, but formation of new type person. Tomsk State University eexperience shows, that creation and actualization of special humanitarian (in particular, cultural) educational programs, helps graduates to be success in professional sphere and a public life. So, for instance, the program "Forming of professional, personal and general cultural competences by means of cultural science - Student of XXI century" directed on the development of tolerance, creativity, communicative competence for students, can be an example of efficient knowledge management in the higher school.

AB The subject of scientific expertise as form of cognitive management is multilevel. As an expert science acts on three levels - personality of the scientist; scientific society, research groups, scientific and expertise organizations (state and non-state); non-commercial non-state public organizations of scientists. Scientific expertise has a number of functions in the mechanism of political decision making, with legitimization, consulting, advisory, analytical, informative, communicative, intermediary and lobbying functions among them. For this purpose special expertise bodies are established, with scientists as obligatory members. These bodies can be of four types: state, non-state commercial, public non-commercial, i.e. elements of civic society, and mixed type. Scientific expertise organizations special created in the sphere of scientific expertise government are called "think tanks". Moreover, classical academic, scientific and educational (institutes and universities) institutions can also function as such centers. There are three models of organization of expert scientific support of the authorities: North American, European and Asian. The three models can be considered as historic socio-cultural and socio-political types. The Asian model specifics are characterized strong centralized state, party and ideological monopoly, which predetermines the existence of one client ordering expertise. In general, it is worth differentiating two main models - western and non-western, with each having its own subtypes. Thus, European and North American models are subtypes of the western model. Then it will be logical to single out transitive and hybrid variants. Modern Russia, for instance, demonstrates a transition from the non-western model to the western one. There can be singled out different types of scientific expertise based on different classification criteria. Scientific expertise can be conducted, first, on different levels of authoritative power (federal, regional, local); in different governmental branches (legislative and executive); second, in different spheres (education, health care, economy, atomic energy, foreign policy, environment, etc.); third, permanently or now and then; fourth, in a complex or one-sided way, systematically or structurally; fifth, independently or by order; sixth, secretly or openly, seventh, officially or unofficially.

AB The article presents an attempt to relate differences in approaches to epistemology to the major differences between the existing management theories. The topicality of establishing this relation arises from the fact that the origination of a modern management theory called Knowledge Management, which is grounded on the idea that knowledge is the main strategic resource of any organization, resulted from the development of different views on management. Therefore understanding this relation would bring it to light how managers' views on knowledge were formed and would allow interconnections and discrepancies between different papers on Knowledge Management to be seen more clearly.

DE knowledge management; cognitive manager; science
AB Cognitive management system has two levels. The first includes the subjects of knowledge management. The second level is the processes, mechanisms by which knowledge management occurs. The people who run their own knowledge, are cognitive managers. Considering the process of knowledge management at the university, we mean students in the capacity of "cognitive managers". They are direct participants in the educational process. A modern student no more gains knowledge according to the plan "professor - knowledge - student". A contemporary professor became an assistant in obtaining knowledge. A student formulates without assistance his own cognitive program. Becomes a manager of knowledge. A student as cognitive manager has two features. Firstly, the cognitive manager has his own "means of production": intelligence, memory, knowledge, initiative, personal experience, belonging to him. Secondly, the cognitive manager can work effectively only in a team. In fact, students studying at the university, have always managed his own knowledge, received, accumulated, systematized, used. But it is especially important nowadays, since the society has moved into the information phase, the knowledge economy has begun to develop. A huge competition in the labor market made a student to become a cognitive manager. Due to the fact that people are the sources and carriers of knowledge, all the organizational knowledge management systems are based on the interaction of people. The culture of knowledge spread and exchange is very important at the University. This culture involves the creation of formal and informal associations of all participants in the educational process for the joint management of knowledge. The necessity of action in such associations demands certain abilities from a cognitive manager: the possession of a high level of communication skills, mobility, and competence in matters of organization. Knowledge management demands the actions in different directions from the student : to find and connect with people who possess the necessary information, to join in the information flows, a search and structuring of information, verification of the results of its activities, the ability to present information. The transformation of the student in cognitive manager requires him to expand his circle of competence and continuing work on the management of his own knowledge.

DE ethics; Christianity; the Middle Ages; lie; truth; communication
AB Analyzing an ontological doctrine of the truth shaped by the church intellectuals both of the West and the East the author demonstrates that the elite culture of the Middle Ages created a deep and multidimensional perception of the truth. In the light of that Christian culture the truth was understood as correspondence binding a mode of existence of a thing with God's eternal design of the latter. In particular a person is as much true in that sense as one embodies the divine idea, or logos, in one's own life. The logos includes a human nature designed by God and a mode of existence proper to it. According to medieval thinkers' views, lie had been brought in the world by the devil - the first being who willfully perverted his mode of existence having rebelled against God and consequently against his own nature as a nature of every thing is based in God. Being a key kind of the evil lie shares with it a common feature - existentional vacuum: it is what is absent in the existence. Therefore a principal incompatibility towards the truth and lie was stated. A "good" lie is a fiction because there are not such good aims in fact to which a lie could direct. This thesis explains reasons of ethical maximalism preached by the medieval Church. The latter postulated a radical refusal of lie demending from its members to be perfectly true. Studying attempts to work out a typology of lie the author considers appropriate conceptions and draws of the St. Augustine, St. Isidore of Seville, St. Dorotheus of Gaza. It is also argued the presented doctrine of lie was not an idle intellectual play, but a sort of diagnosis of illness that has been making humankind suffer since the transgression. Understanding of the illness put a problem of its therapy before the thinkers. Its methods are analyzed in the work as well.

DE epistemology; semiotics; philosophical text; meaning; sense
AB Modem philosophy, which is not a tradition of bringing the wisdom now, but an orderly systematic discourse, which is incarnated thanks to a special literary art, can be considered as a specific communicative environment. In this perspective every philosophical text appears before us as a material embodiment of a special philosophical language, which is the updating of some "the second order" logic. This logic works every time through the system for cause-and-effect relations in the sphere of improving the conditions of the possibility of any kind "linear" reflection. In our opinion, an area in which the language is actually itself is an epistemology. The content of the events of the formation of philosophical language is a double "abduction" of natural language. As the first "abduction" is the introduction of a ban on the use of nearby natural meanings of the words. The second "abduction" is detection for "reverse" the meanings of the incident sense, which appears out of their direct logic. In fact, philosophical sense is the body of the events of the second "abduction" of natural language, which marks a "theft" of any meanings at all after the "theft" of the closest meanings. The place of this kind of "abduction" is a philosophical text. In line with all of the above, there is a possibility to consider epistemology (the epistemological method of "abduction" of natural language through the philosophy) as a general theory of assigning a meaning, as far as it being is the correlation of the intellectual order in its structural and architectonic integrity with the procedure of the world. In the framework of the Westem epistemology, we distinguished three historical varieties of the theory of assigning a meaning: the metaphysics of meaning, the phenomenology of meaning and psychoanalysis of meaning.

DE Kant; Heidegger; contemplation; thinking; imagination; autonomy
AB The article provides a cataloging direct and indirect arguments in favor of autonomy M.Heidegger ability of contemplation in the Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason". The analysis is based on the early lectures M.Heidegger "Kant and das Problem der Metaphusik" and "Phanomenologische Interpretation von Kants Kritik der reinen Vemunft", as well as the text of the famous "Davos debate between E.Kassirer and M.Heidegger." All of Heidegger's arguments regarding the autonomous nature of contemplation in Kant divided into 2 groups: Arguments regarding the contemplation of itself without regard to its relationship with other powers; Arguments concerning the interaction of contemplation with the imagination and thinking. These direct argument added an indirect, arising from the understanding of being, recorded in the early work of Kant "The only possible basis for proving the existence of God," and in the "Critique of Pure Reason," refutes the ontological proof of God's existence. The four arguments regarding the contemplation of itself: 1) distinguish the phenomenon and the "thing in it self" as intuitio originarius and intuitio derivativus (key to Kant's distinction in the world of phenomena and the world of noumena is possible only on the basis of intuition); 2) non-discursive character of representations of space and time, a demonstration of an incorrect interpretation of space and time as categories, that is, general, not singular representations; 3) the comprehensibility of a movement based on the idea of time; paradoxes as a consequence of attempts to interpret the movement horizon of thinking; 4) specific a priori intuition. There are three arguments concerning the interaction with other faculties of contemplation: 1) the inability of the analytical content of the concepts of origin (contemplation as the only source of content concepts); 2) the scheme as a priori definition of time (schemes as product of imagination can not work if there is defined, that is, time as a stand-alone instance); 3) the need to distinguish between the form of contemplation and formal contemplation (this argument is directed against the attempt to interpret the Marburg school space and time as a category). Additionally the argument stemming from Kant's thesis about the existence and the refutation of the ontological proof of God's existence.

AB Relevance of a subject of article is defined by need of ensuring adoption of competent administrative decisions the higher education institution connected with preparation of experts demanded in the region. Object of research of article is the analysis of interrelation of the maintenance of FGOS and requirements of regional labor markets. Detection of discrepancy between planned number of graduates of higher education institutions of certain directions and specialties and real requirements of regional labor markets (in this case the Altai territory) became an object of research. For a basis of methodology of research the author took the activity approach defining the contents and specifics of professions, methods of the historical, concrete historical, comparative analysis. As a result of the conducted research the following provisions and conclusions locate in article: - until recently regional higher education institutions didn't own effective technologies of interaction with a labor market, poorly interacted with employers and business; - for the last 15 years higher education institutions from external technologies mastered only advertizing activity, and that only generally information character; - among the most scarce professions in the region following the results of the second quarter 2012 in the Altai territory steel: doctors, insurance agents, forwarding agents on transportation of goods, marketing managers and to production sale, doctors-pediatory, pharmacists, quality engineers, druggists, laboratory doctor. Thus, orientation to requirements of the regional markets of professions demands a certain adjustment in plans of preparation of graduates of higher education institutions, independence of higher education institution in acceptance of a number of administrative decisions.

DE corporation; corporate culture; knowledge society
AB This article is about the current models of knowledge creation in organizations (corporations), and that people who create knowledge (creative class). It emphasizes the role of corporate culture in the creation of institutional conditions for proceeding in a continued process of knowledge creation. Corporate culture of any modern organization is based on the intellectual component in the continuous production and processing of knowledge. This is due to increasing of the intellectual component percentage in any product, producing of any modern corporation. And the trend is that this component continues to grow. To serve the new economy with intellectual product at the core, a powerful new social stratum has been called: intellectual class or "creative class". Knowledge workers who are able to apply knowledge to the benefit, now are so successful than the capitalists, who can profitably invest. So corporations seek and hire on permanent and temporary (which is very common) creative work those people who are able consistently produce innovative knowledge, i.e. knowledge that in the future will able to provide a competitive advantage, and (or) profit. In the modern society,that is often named as knowledge society qualitatively different knowledge is demanded than previous socioeconomic systems demanded. The knowledge that continuously produced by any corporation for the survival and successful development, now is more flexible, short-term, liquid, applicable "here and now" and not meant to be fundamental. But this knowledge is not the same that information, but in contrast, is the product of processing more and more layers of information. Why knowledge has become such a qualitatively different? This was due to such characteristics of the new social reality as instability, the intensity of information flows, volatility, and fluidity. Models of knowledge creation differ. But whatever the particular model of knowledge creation in corporation, corporate culture is required to perform the specified function, and thus create the conditions to ensure continuously flowing process of developing innovative knowledge.

DE truth emancipation; morality; dialectical materialism; "is" and "ought
   to be"
AB This article presents the main points of Oleg Drobnicki's moral philosophy, including the view how the philosophy of dialectical materialism can be supplemented by Kantian views. The question of the relationship of elimination of private property, while the "true emancipation" - that is, maintains one's moral duty and morality in complex. Article determines what was particularly specific for Soviet ethics and how it was born amid heavy pressure of the Leninist-Stalinist mechanical determinism. What als ob (sort of) was missed in the Soviet form of Marxism in its quest for the liberation of man, and why was the categorical imperative again to enter the arena of philosophical discourse in soviet philosophy? Why, in the end, Marx sought by his philosophical doctrines? His life's work can be summed up in the expression: "Human Emancipation". Philosophical, political and economic development of Marx's thought is moving under the sign of the difference between the actual (but not sufficient) bourgeois liberation and true human liberation, which has yet to be realized. The next move of the official Soviet philosophy or dialectical materialism was "planting" the morality, or rather its introduction to the masses, especially to those masses who "misunderstood", or they suffered from some aberration (deviation) of the "correct" behaviour, which was destined als ob historically. The individual did not understand his "benefits" and "good" when it is not acting on the basis of the principles of social and economic relations of the proletariat class. In our view it would be desirable to raise the question: is it possible to replace the philosophical ethics by historical materialism? "Dialectical materialism did not take into account a more accurate interpretation of Marxism that the emancipation of man can not be fully realized only with the abolition of class distinctions, but only through the complex as a complete destruction of private property, as well as moral and spiritual liberation, in which there is a place for spiritual renewal. Even those based on the experience of the Soviet Union, we can say that the abolition of private property does not guarantee freedom to a person and human alienation from the products of its production. Unfortunately, Communist Parties dictate of "proper moral instruction" has led to enslavement of man, and there existed kind of moral code of rules. The same thing could be said about "Liberal" and "Democratic" Western society, which always has double standards and in fact proclaimed democracy, that can only be camouflaged doctrine of consumer society.
   Our philosopher tried to solve the problem and proper things in the perspective of Marxist philosophy, he tried to construct the bridge between what "is" and what "ought to be", that was usual in soviet philosophy. According to Hume's tradition: from the descriptive expressions can not necessarily lead to prescriptive provisions - in morals, our soviet philosopher solves the problem by usage of the concept of morality, emanating from some of the genesis of the history of philosophy. In summarizing Drobnicki's thoughts, we can say that an understanding of the relationship of history and creation of prerequisites for the development in accordance with them is the highest duty.

It is asserted that until naturalistic theory investigates facts of objective world of the nature it stays on the position of scientific realism. Scientific realism asserts existence of objective reality and a possibility of knowledge of it. But since naturalistic researches begin consideration of cognitive processes of the human being as a knowledge subject they represent anti-realistic position. In the framework of the position naturalistic researches formulate skeptic theses on cognitive capacities of the human being.

TI THE PROBLEM OF GLOBALIZATION: MULTIDISCOURSE FORMATION
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE globalization; discourse; civilization; universalism; multiculturalism
AB The problem of globalization discourse is discussed. The main trends of issues on globalization are researched. This paper mainly focuses on one dimension of globalization: globalization as discourse. In the first part of the paper some of the key debates and themes that exist within the discourse of globalization are investigated. In the second part multi-discourse of globalization is presented. The main author's deductions and prospects of development of globalization issues are outlined in the conclusion. The pinnacle concerning discourse of globalization is registered in the 1990s. Globalization enters the agenda of writers, politicians, social leaders, representatives of corporate organizations and academic sciences. Theoretical debates in the period have different appraisals: from a negative definition of globalization as a global babble to a wide spread fascination of globalization. In spite of innumerable debates and boom of the literature, the theorizing of this problem is only partially developed. Economics, international relations, political sciences, sociology, etc. are all concerned with the analysis of the phenomenon of globalization, though globalization remains a pretty marginal topic for other disciplines. In the most recent theoretical debates, depending on the character of the process of globalization (homogeneous or fragmentary), two trends of investigation of this process arise: (i) globalization on the basis of the idea of progress which leads to a homogeneous world (universalism); (ii) globalization on the basis of the representation of the world's real diversity (multiculturalism). Multicultural concepts of globalization, based on the recognition of the world diversity, are popular because of their non- repressive and tolerant form. Theorists of globalization stress the fact that modern globalization process includes many instances of globalization. From my own point of view, various interpretations of globalization can be fit (to a certain extent) into a conceptual frame which includes the following main concepts: historical, geopolitical, economic, social, political, legal, and informational globalization. Historically the process of globalization is connected with the evolution of the global world community. This consideration brings us to the global Enlightenment problem, which excels the narrow context of the Enlightenment of the 18th c., which was mainly inspired by national and historical narratives. Interpretation of globalization as a stage in the development of the world community, which comes after modernization, is a topic of wide discussion. In social analysis one finds three theoretical positions about the interpretation of globalization: radical globalism, moderate globalism, anti-globalism. Political theorists have been busy addressing the normative implication of globalization; they also discuss the change of nature of contemporary power. In contemporary legal theoretical debates discussions are centered on the interpretation of globalization from an isolated individual through a national state to a global state. Some theorists investigate globalization as a process of global network formation. So, discourse of the problem of globalization has a multi-disciplinary character.

DE target set; education; effective management
AB The target set in higher educational institutions represents the elaborate process which participants are customers of education, performers and being trained. The organization of a target set is included into area of interests of managers of higher educational institutions and managers of public authorities and local government. In the field of this interaction there is a number of the unresolved problems connected with preparation of curricula, comparison of interests and vectors of development of branches and HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS and much other. Effective management of a target set, is urged to solve a number of questions, annually arising at the organization of a competitive set and further training of future experts.
   Management of a target set at a development stage represents bilateral cooperation. The educational institution for its part develops educational plans, and the public institutions long-term and medium-term plans of work including a set of employees on certain workplaces, according to developed programs of development. Comparison of curricula and development plans of establishment is made at a stage of the decision on quantity of target places for certain directions. Competences which the graduate has to possess, have to master the requirements shown by the employer. And it is necessary to put in advance in competence curricula, perspective after 4-6 summer terms. It mentions areas of strategic planning in which management represents decision-making in not set, and only predicted conditions. Dynamics of development of modern society, puts in the forefront the functions of the management connected with forecasting and a choice of a way of development on the basis of built forecasts. Management within the set static conditions, the initial management of the current processes otherly than management within changing conditions. In relation to education institute, specifics of decision-making by management structure, dictates need for the organization of work of the research groups working in the field of forecasting. This requirement is expressed in assignment to higher educational institutions of the status "scientifically research" within the walls of which science and education merge is carried out. Management of educational structure, in relation to the state order for target training, has to coordinate results of the activity on development of training programs, being included in the market relations with other social institutes, thus without receding from the general mission of university which Jose Ortega-i-Gasset formulated as: "teaching of the main cultural and significant disciplines".

DE analytic philosophy; philosophy of language; philosophy of logical
   analysis; linguistic philosophy; theory and methodology
AB In the article possibilities of analytic philosophy (philosophy of the logical analysis and linguistic philosophy) in formation of general theory of language are considered. It's shown that though the methodology of analytic philosophy of language is rather productive in language analysis, nevertheless, its potentialities in formation of a general, complete theory of language necessity of which is dictated by development of systems of intellectual management, are limited. Limitation of potentialities of methods of logical and linguistic analysis of language can be seen in an isolationism of corresponding to these methods representations about language, which means consider language separately from its essential characteristics and components. If philosophy of logical analysis ignores subject-realization of language, then the linguistic philosophy ignores role of internal mental processes in speech activity of the subject, and both these directions of analytic philosophy ignore a figurative, figurative-sensual component of language. Thus certain paradox in existence of analytic philosophy of language can be seen, when having the methodological instruments of the language analysis, it doesn't offer a relevant conceptual-theoretical explanation of language. Nevertheless analytic philosophy of language has internal potential for overcoming of an isolationism of its views on language. Not in the last place existence of such potential is caused by change of analytic philosophy of language methodological positions concerning in particular critique of metaphysics and critique of general judgments use. View change on metaphysics allows also view change on general judgments, on generalizations and makes potentially possible formation of general analytic theory of language. But concept-methodological synthesis (when methods of the logical and linguistic analysis (ordinary language analysis), semiotics, information-cybernetic, evolution-genetic methods are united), which is necessary in such formation leads language investigations out of limits of actual analytic philosophy of language therefore problem of self-identification of analytic philosophy as philosophy of language becomes rather important.

DE rule-following; Kripkenstein's paradox; skepticism; true order;
   replication
AB This article is devoted to thirtieth anniversary of the first publication in 1982 Saul Kripke's book "Wittgenstein on rules and private language". Radical skeptical interpretation of the work 'late' Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed by Saul Kripke in this book is considered one of the most famous "puzzle" of modern philosophy of language, which has become a source of much debate and discussion on the nature of the linguistic sign and its meaning. This article examines some of the consequences of a radical version of skeptical 'rule-following' paradox by Saul Kripke, which remain in force and effect for finite functions and limited linguistic registers 'Ad finitum'. Thereby questioned the widely held view among analytic philosophers that the skeptical core for Saul Kripke's 'rule-following' paradox is argument 'Ad infinitum' (an inherent source of skepticism for our intention to follow the rule is concluded in itself situation of mastering for us endless function on the limited set of examples), and thus any direct or even moderate solutions of this paradox would be focused to its elimination. Thus proved that including for the field of finite functions and languages described theirs the skeptical force of 'rule-following' paradox itself completely saves. Moreover, undertaken in this article analysis detects a very quaint phenomenon to the field of language registers 'Ad finitum' - the effect of 'replication' (in the using of a linguistic phrase is always a n-th set of empirically equivalent but logically incompatible and even non-identical languages which it belongs). Study of the phenomenon of replication leads to a number of important remarks on many critics of Saul Kripke's skeptical paradox, in particular the famous Oxford philosopher Gordon Baker and Peter Hacker. Thus the concept of 'community speakers' has been called by Saul Kripke for skeptical solution to paradox of him own cannot be eliminated by the concept of 'share' and 'shareable' languages proposed for this aim by Gordon Baker and Peter Hacker. Despite the criticism the skeptical paradox 'rule-following' by Saul Kripke is still the center of attention and remains influential in modern philosophy of language and the theory of value.

DE social system; development; forecast; management; Knowledge Society
AB Peculiarities of forecasting of social systems' development is analyzed in the article. It is shown that conditions of emerging Knowledge Society determine perfectly new peculiarities of social forecasts. The possibility of social forecasting with reasonable accuracy has been a subject of a lengthy discussion for many years. Changes dynamics, impact on the environment, management complexity and the importance of forecasting have been increasing during the period of transformation of the pre-industrial society to the industrial one, and then to the post-industrial society. Under that circumstances information becomes the main resource, and the forecasting of social systems' development becomes crucial. The macro environment uncertainty exacerbates management complexity caused by the nonlinearity of social processes. Besides, a potential multiplicity of directions of social systems' development determines not only the wide range of possible trajectories, but also complexity of emerging problems. The transformation of modern society to society in which knowledge becomes the key resource deserves special attention nowadays. Knowledge makes significant changes not only in the behavior models of social systems, but also in their environment. High dynamics and uncertainty of the environment has long been one of the most significant consequences of the global information space' formation. Sharing of information and communication technologies created conditions for essential changes in the ways of social interaction and adaptation. On the one hand, the globalization created new opportunities for social systems' development. On the other hand, it made their environment extremely dynamic and uncertain. At the same time, the absence of strict predetermination for social systems' development creates preconditions for the emergence of perfectly new social structures. The structures are characterized by high level of adaptability which implies ability to searching and making effective decisions. To our opinion, it expands the boundaries of the social forecasting and managing significantly.

DE systems theory; meta-knowledge; competence; value
AB By differentiating obvious and hidden knowledge the article defines the concept of meta-knowledge.
   Meta-knowledge is a key factor of cognitive management, it defines the priority management goals in learning institutions. Meta-knowledge formation is the fact that distinguishes learning organizations from the teaching ones. The question of how higher education schools can transform into learning institutions is the key one in the modern conditions of new educational standards introduction. Two tasks are given, whose solution will provide effective cognitive management launch in a teaching organization. The first task is to start the process of generation of diverse interpretations of knowledge. This task is congenial to self-discovery of knowledge management principles in a certain institution: cognitive management, if positioned correctly, will promote the formation of flexible and dynamic meta-knowledge. The second task is the formation of values. In cognitive management values should be considered in the context of competences and the topical problem of analytical presentation of education results in competence specification. The author's observation of specifications shows an excessive amount of description of what the student is to know. As a result, the idea of the scope of knowledge is lost, which leads to the reduction of meta-knowledge content. In terms of values the attention must shift to the roles and positions of education participants. Social-psychological roles in education acquire value and sense when the aspect 'role in respect of the other' (e.g., the role of a teacher a student can play) becomes the aspect 'role in respect of oneself'. Mastering one role in two aspects forms a position - a unity of values and senses. Position directly influences the quality of interaction. Competences are realized when each participant is able to hold four aspects of teamwork on task solving: 1) something to do for oneself; 2) something to do oneself; 3) something to do for the others; 4) something to do together with the others. Meta-knowledge in this case is described by the formula "I know that you know I know". Knowledge of one's actions for oneself creates confidence (in oneself and the others), knowledge of actions for everyone to take creates trust, knowledge of actions one will take for the others creates gratitude, knowledge of actions to take together creates enthusiasm. Confidence, trust, gratitude and enthusiasm must be the priority goals in cognitive management. If they are not achieved, cognitive management will be reduced to inefficient formalization.

DE knowledge management; training institution; benchmarking traps
AB Nowadays the world is on the threshold of the sixth scientific and technical revolution. The task of the priority development of science and the dynamic implementation of its achievements is brought to the forefront. The appearance of the new subject - "knowledge management" - became one of the responses to the challenges of modern times. The core of the knowledge management issues is the formation of training institutions. The emphasis in the field of knowledge has been shifted: if the researchers' attention earlier was focused primarily on the subject areas chosen by them, then nowadays it is studied how knowledge is produced, used and reproduced inside an organization. Henceforth a firm is a "sanctuary" where the society produces new knowledge, and a manager is a "priest" who contributes to the mining of it. The key component of institution's knowledge is latent, implicit knowledge which has by the way about 90 % share of all institution's knowledge. Latent knowledge is institution's "practical reason", it is impossible to set it out on any storage medium or even to pronounce it. Knowledge received and developed through experience is "sticky", it sticks to institutions and certain people that is why it is impossible to sell and buy it in the free market. The emphasis in the field of benchmarking has been shifted as well in connection with this. The traditional replication of products, processes and procedures of other institutions guarantees only downfall to the level of these institutions. The creation of self-developing organization on the basis of efficient use of creative abilities of all employees became the goal of benchmarking tools. Heads of organizations who do not realize the necessity of interactive managerial changes can not add dynamism to innovation-based development. The main competitive advantage nowadays is the ability to cognize faster than one's competitors.

DE Postmodern; trans-humanism; Youth non-conformist Association; a marginal
   status of the person
AB By the end of the twentieth century, man has been saturated and overloaded qualities do not determine it, as an persona. Modern man finds the details of its in image, the properties, connection, structure, but not himself. Man, according to N.A.. Berdyaev, "falls into the surrounding of the objective world". Man dissolves in the world of mobile technology, the privet property and social exclusion. The society also operates man, calculates its statistically, distributed in organizations and subcultures that use it for different purposes. This depersonalization ("Me" is the "hole of nothingness into being", J.P. Sartre) switches to "destruction" and spraying of person in dehumanization reality, which is manifested, in particular, in science and contemporary art. In this sense, illustrative transition of public attention and popular science in the end of XX - the beginning of XXI century to transpersonal psychology, spiritual practices in the spirit of Castaneda, Aurobindo's integral yoga, etc. The General trend was the output of the individual for the scope of the spatio-temporal and causal borders. If to the twentieth century for philosophy, anthropology, education, psychology and sociology was axiom: "person - Person - Work - Subject - Freedom", at the end of the twentieth century the realization that the main thing is not the struggle for freedom and not even achieve freedom, but the experience of freedom (the ability of the soul to have freedom for himself). It may turn out like the freedom of the will and equally as the will to captivity. The freedom can turn like the direct arbitrariness, violence over the nature of society and new man. But can open the harmony of the world, the extent and depth of responsibility for it. At the first stage of a man of many faces no longer try to be a man of the public (as all others) - this is the main philosophy and social-psychological basis of this conduct. Youth informal movements was demonstrating the non-conformism of the human personality, for which the marginality is a struggle for their own "Me", and the socialization is perceived as forced and violence against the person. Homo acquires the features of the individual, which is not in need of personality structures of self. Like any Individual, life unit, independent of and in morphological and physiological aspects is not have needed in the subject of the socio-cultural life, the beginning of the individual, in the contexts of social relations and communication.
   Today any characteristics of a "Me" begin with the presentation of himself, as the external image for identification through clothing, signs (including, body, in the body, to the body) and a set of gadgets -, i.e., through the communication capacity of special objects and machines, designed to maintain links on the communication channels in the social space. Modern man evolves through three main types of catastrophic changes: 1) a civilization catastrophe - the collapse of basic social institutions (economic, legal, political, etc.). It is a crisis of the entire social "corporeality" of the human race; 2) cultural catastrophe - the destruction of the fundamental normative values began to spiritual, religious, moral character. The crisis of the qualities which gave man the hostel humanistic border; 3) anthropological catastrophe - negative mutations in the type of the human person. Crisis deforming the psyche, the mind. The crisis of General degradation. This article describes the modern trends, associated with the emergence and expansion in the social philosophy of transpersonal and trans-humanism directions, which will changing not only the views on the individual and society, but also will change the shape of future social Sciences.

DE communicative reality; university; knowledge management; cognitive
   management
AB There is a need to find a new model of university knowledge management in communicative reality of our time, where a new picture of the world can not be represented with the knowledge, detached from the knower and his subjective realities, raised in the article. Synergetic understanding of the man as a complex self-organizing system indicates that old methods of development, in which a person forced on the existing knowledge does not work well in the new environment. The openness of such a complex self-organizing systems as a man reveals through interaction with the environment where the information exchange is a cognitive activity. There is a need to appeal not just to the experience of knowledge management that already exists in the business, but to the development of knowledge management model based on the communicative paradigm of modem philosophy in the system of university education. A shift from the individual method of accumulation and the development of new knowledge and collective poly-discursive model inherent in communicative social reality and defining knowledge as a result of intelligence exchange focuses primarily on cognitive practices. There is need for a new approach to knowledge management, which differs from the conveyor model of creation and dissemination of knowledge, which characterizes most modern universities, the approach that uses the principles of network logic. As such a model of university knowledge management the author considers cognitive management, seeing it not only as knowledge management, but also as philosophy of modern university education.

DE information society; cognitive management; competence-oriented
   education; cognitive self-management of the student
AB Information, that is different from the knowledge with its aloof nature, exists in virtual, chaotic flow. Do the universities keep pace with changes in society? Are they are able to train specialists who can act and function in the socio-cultural and professional uncertainty? Russia's joining the Bologna process and the transition to the educational standards of 3rd generation is the answer to the challenges and requirements of the information society: higher education (bachelor degree) becomes popular and common, forms competence of self-education and provides the basis for a lifetime of "flexible "education. Thus, the system of cognitive management becomes actual. The student should be able to construct individual path and be flexible by selecting courses and programs, to become his own c manager and the teacher becomes a tutor. Foresight technologies contribute to the development of subjective position of the student. The form of cognitive self-management is a student's portfolio, which is not only effective form of evaluation and self-assessment, but also a solution of important tutorial problems. A possible support is provided by a training course "The content and organization of educational activities of students during the development of competence-oriented basic educational program in accordance with Federal educational standards". This course is optimized for four years of study and is held twice - at the beginning of the school year and at the end. Basic educational technology - designing of individual competence-oriented education programs by students, monitoring, diagnostics, and self-presentation of each academic year. Essentially, it is a course "tutor" accompanies students throughout their undergraduate training.

DE good society; norm; values; meaning; cognition
AB The article attempts to raise a question of the cognitive study of normative aspects of the "good society." The conundrum of coexistence in one living space of individuals with opposite values is being described. The author analyzes the process of the formation of the theory of the "good society" taking into consideration neo-liberal and communitarian debate. The most remarkable is the point of view of communitarians, who believe that civil society is not enough, since it does not solve the problems of common values. Idea is that the theory of a modem society should be a theory of a "good society." Such theory will prove the variety of values of a decent life. Thus, it is possible identify cognitive study of the normative aspects of the "good society". Basing on the works of Edmund Husserl, the authors comes to the following conclusions: First, the normative judgments can be formulated as a result of the theoretical concepts and as "the must". Second, conventional reasoning are related with the scope of meanings and values of everyday life. Third, conventional reasoning are about the empirical experience of people or their subjective assessment (what is considered valuable). Thus, the difficulty of defining "good society" and the statement "society must be good" is that a "good" acts as the maximum score of all possible predicates, and therefore, is the most multi-valued characteristic. The author concludes that the word "good" requires knowledge of certain rules, but the complexity is that "good" is a basic standard itself. In the article there are two types of normative aspects: moral norm, which has value for members of a certain community only, and the norm, which indicates the basic value, according to which, it must be rated. The vision of the "good society" includes both methods of forming normative aspects. But cognitive reasoning of the normative aspects of the "good society" has not been done yet. Undoubtedly, the concept of a "good society" will become clear after it is worked out in theory. This issue is poorly understood and requires further research.

DE Systems; cause-and-effect; types of natural interactions
AB In search of natural regularities, efforts often are directed at revealing of cause-and-effect connections between the two entities. Cause and effect are tied by the necessary and sufficient relation: if the cause has happened, then the effect must happen obligatory; if the effect happened, then the cause has been happened before. There is no need in the presence of third entities for these events. However, due to the general law of universal interconnections and interdependences in Nature, the other entities are always interfering into interaction between any two entities. Hence, the actual relation between couple of objects is always different from the cause-and-effect one. The character of intervention of third entities into action between the two parties considered, may be of great variety, and this can roughly be presented by its classification in accordance with indications of necessity and sufficiency. The necessary and sufficient connexion is called a cause-and-effect one. It is a scientific abstraction (called "law of nature") digressed from a presence and influence of third entities. The necessary, but not sufficient connexion is characterized by terms "system-forming factor", "producer - product". The sufficient, but not necessary connexion is called "a directed tie". The not necessary and not sufficient, but essential connexion is called "associative", or "probabilistic", or "stochastic" one. Examples of the four types of pair-wise ties are given. It is emphasized that different ties need be treated differently in human practice, and that an error in identification of the type of a tie leads to failures in practice.

AB The culture as an equivalent of the country's national value is losing its lead role. The modern educational society is a base for the change of a mono-cultural to a multicultural principle, where the national signs disappear or fall into the shade while universality and flexibility of the educational system play the main role. Therefore a new university model should be transparent, mobile and ready for the transformation of the present structures. The modern society is developing in the context of the market economy dictating its conditions including the change of the elitism to the liberal principle of the higher education system. The liberal conception of education where the individualism has priority meaning plays a special role in the solving the problem of the education of elite specialists in the modern university. In response to commercialization the higher education is becoming an article of the knowledge production recognized on the global level. The main aim of the university in this context is the developing of a new educational model, which helps to create a new higher educational content for the purpose of accumulation a new knowledge accepted as "intellectual capital". The knowledge itself and its production are changing in the context of the commercialization of higher education, in addition "the production of science" (conditions of the knowledge production created by the industry) is developing. To sum up, the process of globalization developing the cultural paradigm of higher education forms the conditions for the change of the classical university considered to be a center of social culture aimed at the education of elite specialists to the communication-based flexible university responding to the all changes in education environment on the global level with taken into account the economic frameworks of society development.

AB Virtually all forms of social activity are seen as the project activity, when the project regarding the increase in acts of a fragment of the network, resulting in a maintenance and further development of social networks. This concept is fully consistent with the technological platform of modern society, helps a lot to clarify the processes of economic, financial, informational, and other globalizations. The contemporary society appears as a network design and society. In this situation radically changed channels and mechanisms of transmission and acquisition of knowledge. Product, the result of knowledge management as the management of such network processes is not just information or knowledge, and certain social and human capital. Social capital becomes a clearly defined information and communicative nature. The quality of human capital in this situation is changing as well. It first of all - the ability to be flexible in terms of production problems, searches for relevant information, decision-making, involving partners, building relationships with them. Network relationships generate additional rent, the use of which gives rise to the temptation to use someone else's human capital. Thus, the modern knowledge management is a major challenge, both in terms of organizational performance, and its legal and moral conditions and factors. All this means a serious challenge to modern education.

In this context, as a rough draft a principle of polydeterminism is grounded. In short it sums up the knowledge of complex structure of determination of science that has been obtain during a long time, and converts it into a certain cognitive attitude - an approach to analyzing the nature of science from a position of multiplicity of its determination. A principle of polydeterminism is also heuristic producing a backward effect - determination of society, culture, and history by science. Vectors of this determination are multidirectional, and aftereffects cannot be predicted.

DE householder; household finance; financial planning; forecasting
AB The householder life from the financier point of view is obtaining the income and implementation of expenses in foreseeable prospect. The household is a combination of a base asset and a property complex. Finance of a household has the certain structure which elements are administration, income, expenses, reserves, debts, investments, insurance protection. Dynamics of a household is outwardly expressed in change of their types. Internal development of a household can be studied by the concept of the household life way. In the economic plan the household is a set of the administered capitals, most important of them: human, economic, the capital of health. These capitals turn "person" into a base asset. The household exists in the conditions of uncertainty, its future vaguely and isn't learned, as a considerable part of information concerning this future doesn't exist yet. Stereotypes and the conventions defining human decisions can't be calculated exactly. The scientific base for forecasting of the household lifeline is absent, though in practice this process is used in a mass order. Self-management is the possibility of successful life in the conditions of uncertainty and the base for its forecasting. The basis and the purpose of self-management is to come to "a longevity route". According to H.S.Friedman and L.R.Martin's concept, longevity is based on "the wellness", reached through a four-componental way of life: a) traditional physical and mental health; 6) successful career, in) safe marriage, g) social contacts. Financial planning is an integral part of a household management, relies on forecasting of dynamics of a household development and requires a positive forecast. Differently planning is not meaningful. The purpose of financial planning is formation of sufficient amount of money for achievement of the household purposes within available sources and uniform distribution of consumption during life. Thus, despite impossibility of creation of reasonable and authentic forecasts of a household development, household life forecasting is necessary for households and is carried out in practice.

TI ARTIFICIAL LIFE AS SUBVERSION OF FLESH: STRATEGIES FOR HYBRIDIZATION
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE artificial life; hybridization; science art
AB The paper is devoted to ontological issues of artificial life as modification of the flesh. The author assumes that artificial life becomes possible through subversion of the biological life to the level of manipulations with raw material and creation of the hybrid forms. As a methodological foundation the author uses an original approach and applies science art (contemporary art based on scientific research and new technologies) claiming it to be a philosophical method that helps us to combine material aspects of science and technology with cultural and political meanings. The idea of hybridity is also considered as both an ontological combination of individual objects and a useful cultural metaphor for this kind of possible combinations. The author claims to prove that contemporary understanding of hybridity is rooted in the modernist world view as it is scientific transformation. Its radical version is well known to be a foundation of the Bolshevik ideology. In the paragraph ''Advent of the Hybrid'' there are two early and exemplary modernist scientific experiments of subversing the flesh described. One is made by transplantology surgeon Serge Voronov with sex glands and the other is experiments with crossbreeding humans and monkeys by zoologist Ilya Ivanov (both were seeking for effects of life longevity and rejuvenation). The analysis of these works allows the author to formulate major principles of hybridization. In the paragraph ''Artists-Bolsheviks: strategies for hybridization'' these principles are applied to the works of science artists and their ontological implications. In the project ''Ear on arm'' of Australian artist Stelarc the subversion of the flesh of the artist himself becomes a de-individualization of the human as a biological entity and moves to the search for alternative anatomic architecture of the human body. In the project ''MEART. The semi-living artist'' by science-art group Symbiotica we face the possibility of artificial life in the form of new kind of creature and development of the ontology of semi-living. Simultaneously ironical as well as absolutely literal transformation of the living organism into industrial flesh to be used as a source of energy or another utility is presented in the work of Joe Davis (project ''Making fire''), James Auger and Jimmy Loiseau (projects ''Carnivorous domestic entertainment robots'', ''Afterlife'') and Tuur van Balen (project ''Pigeon d'Or''). Festival of tissue and the magic of tissue transformation by means of biotechnology is demonstrated in the works of Julia Reodika (project ''HymNext'') and Guy Ben-Ary (project ''In Potencia''). As a conclusion the author proposes a thesis that modernist scientific ambitions and our days experiments of science art as well as the formation of a new culture of artificial life are rooted in some sort of technological unconscious that can be named ''the Preobrazhensky syndrome'' with the reference to the characters of Mikhail Bulgakov's famous novel Heart of a Dog (inspired by works of Ivanov and Voronov).

AB In the article it is noted that the tendency of the last years is the multidirectional movement of scientific thought on the subject of the economic science, on the one hand, and practical activities on composing working programs of the course, on the other. The critical analysis of the content of the course of Economic Theory based on the neoclassical direction is given. The dissatisfaction with an official rate economics is connected with extremely narrow subject domain covering only the market in its superficial forms of manifestation. The modern economic theory leaves outside of the analysis the person with their irrational forms of behaviour, does not address to the dynamic aspect of the market relations, limits the subject to the analysis of functional dependences. Making a start, in particular, from the ideas of the classics of sociology, history, institutionalism, the author proves the point of view, according to which already at the present stage of development of the economic science an organic synthesis of the ideas belonging to interdisciplinary sciences and directions is possible. At the heart of such approach can be the understanding of the object of as economic activity of economic subjects on creation of economic benefits. Such an approach satisfies the tendency of interdisciplinary researches and allows to carry out organic synthesis of ideas and directions. An important methodological precondition, allowing to represent the relations of production as the subject of economic theory deeper, is the layering of the system of relations of production including the external, superficial and deep relations. The value of the institutional theory in development of the economic science from the point of view of the author is, first of all, that it is means of an operationalization of the system of relations of production. Institutes as the central concept of institutionalism, which are meant as rules and standards of behaviour of economic subjects structuring their interaction, serving as a peculiar restrictive framework of behaviour, in the best way are suitable for performance of such a function. The author calls a number of questions of the course of economic theory whose study can be based on combination of representations of economics, political economy, institutionalism, sociology. Among them are the processes of formation of average profit and price of production, profit forms, analysis of categories of utility and limiting sizes, research of the problem of economic power. A number of concrete remarks in connection with the development of the course of Economic Theory according to the Federal Educational Standard are given.

AB Notes on the Context of Contemporary Philosophy in Russia The somewhat confused character of the general situation in Russia leads to an atrophy of reflexive activity. Westerners are often interested in the religious side of Russian thought. But there also exists today a "secular" philosophy, developed according the classical canon: i.e., epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, etc. The philosophy of post-Soviet Russia is characterized by a great openness towards the West, and particularly with respect to contemporary French philosophers.

DT Article
AB Marxism in Contemporary Russia How can we describe the status of both Marxian and Marxist research in post-Soviet Russia in the last decade? Marxists still have an audience; they are part of the political philosophy of contemporary Russia, but their works enjoy very limited attention. The school that deserves most attention is that of "critical Marxism", whose leader is the economist A. V. Buzgalin, which aims at representing the contemporary form of Marxism. It is close to the sociological approach of the political science theorist B. Y. Kagarlitsky. This critical Marxism is ruthless towards the Soviet era, but also tough on contemporary capitalism. The problems adressed by the philosophy of history and of theory of culture receive an original treatment in V. M. Mezhuev. More globally, contemporary Marxist researches, however vehement in their criticism of the Soviet period, use Marxist concepts to study current social issues, both in Russia and in the world in general.

AB The Subject-matter of Contemporary Political Philosophy The disappearance of Soviet ideological pressure was not enough for a Russian rebirth of spontaneous traditions of political thought. But we can feel signs of the appearance of a new school of political philosophy that builds its identity through a dialogue with cognate disciplines ("philosophy of politics" and "political science"). One might regard this transformation as a turn towards a phenomenological approach, though Husserl's interest in the phenomena of consciousness (that is to say in intersubjective and global values) is replaced here by the study of the "process" of morality. The transfer of political morality towards the jurisdiction of consequential ethics creates a new theory which relies on new concepts ("time reversal", "political violence", etc.). All this is well illustrated by the work of Kapustin.

Basis of the article are the results of quantitative and qualitative research, and analysis of complaints to the Ombudsman of Human Rights in Tomsk Region and review the regulatory framework. The author begins with a review of the institutional level. Finds the fixation of human rights issues in the law, embodied in the international legal framework, the presence of NGOs (non-profit) institutions in this area, etc. However, there also is the "gaps" such as the formality of the individual institutions. Then he turns to the attitudes and practices of everyday people on the topic of human rights. And finds that, on the one hand, a large proportion of the citizens said that the significance of the theme is high. But on the other hand, the citizens actually know little about human rights, calling it sometimes to the topic various difficult situations in life, not noticing the real serious violations. Thus, it is concluded that human rights take place at the level of declarations, but not stronger as the total instrumental value in society.

DE family; the formation of the family; single-industry town
AB Half of the towns in Russia are considered to be single-industry towns, accordingly the most of families are town citizens that allows to characterizes such families as the typical for Russian society. The analysis of the family in the condition of territorial single-industry town area is necessary from the initial stage - the forming of the family. Exploring the family and its forming in single-industry town, the author is distinguishing the absolutely opposite features as compared with a big city.
   1. The minimum marriage market with its gomogamny choice of marriage partner. The term "marriage partner" is connected with the identification of selection process of the marriage partner with the bargain. The more the city the maximum the marriage market. Single-industry towns are differ from others its secrecy and isolation. In this regard the gomogamny choice of marriage partner is prevailed, we can observe people with the single race, nation, religion, social level, education, age, the same marriage status and the place of residence. It is convenient to live with parents.
   2. The most number of civil marriages. The spreading of civil marriages is typical to provincial towns not for big cities. It is exclaimed that civil marriage is luxury and economically is not gained. The most metropolitans choose the life with parents, because they have little chance to buy their own dwelling space, and it is too expensive to rent a flat. The girls don't want to burden themselves to keep housing and they think that it is a risky matter because they should not be valued and offered the official relations.
   3. The family affection towards city-forming enterprise. Under conditions of single-industry town all the system of relations, including familiar is formed on the importance of city-forming enterprise in the life of concrete territorial formation. The city-forming enterprise had been for a long time the personification of all vital blessing for the working people and their families. The specific character of factory labor with its accurate regime is influenced on the living standards of the family.
   4. The formation of single-industry town's identity. The territorial behavior of people promotes to form the territorial identity on different levels. The author supposes that in towns having the status of single-industry towns half of the common number, the single-industry town identity is displayed and offers to industry town identity meaning the specific mental level of people living in big cities. The conscious of such citizen was forming not to be as a city-dweller but in a quality of a worker of the labor group.
   5. The ruralization of families. The most industrial cities are new without own history, tradition and the nearest villages which couldn't live there due to social reasons. Thus the country people continue to live in the cities following to their principles and traditions, passing their experience to their children that we can observe at the present moment.

The definition of the residential district is given in the article, its social history is briefly outlined, its main contradictions and the conflicts are described. The residential district inhabitants' modern practices of the space zoning are in the focus of the text.
   The every day life of tipical soviet micro discrict built in the 1970-1980-s is the subject of my article. Relationship between architectures plans and real practises were investigated. A typical Soviet micro district was a well thought-out structure, it was planned like a magic thing, like some kind of utopia. Architects made a "list of practices" which meant where people often walked, when they went to work back home, how they could meet their needs near their house City planners wanted to take into account everything, every human practices. But often the real life is not so good as they planned. One of the main problem is lack of different zones and public places in micro districts. They belong to everyone and don't belong to anyone. Actually this space can be assigned to organizations building shops or parkings or new houses, causes a social conflict between residents and businessmen. But there is only one type of daily conflicts in this place. In this paper investigate how people can construct this zones and their boundaries in everyday life. Three base types of practises were distinguished. Main method is observation.

DE Innovation studies; civilization of technology; social science;
   interdisciplinary
AB There is a lack of understanding of what social and anthropological consequences does innovative development have and what is its impact to the individual and society, country and the world community. Modem innovation studies have to consider these aspects. To show the grounds of the development of the innovation studies is a main objective of this article.
   Innovation studies became the new independent scientific field at the second half of the 20th century. The reason was scientific, technical and socio-economic development at the USA and European countries. Epistemological foundations of the innovation studies are philosophy, economics, management, engineering, design, entrepreneurship, system analysis, cybernetics, information technology, sociology, cultural studies, etc.
   A brief history of innovations shows that its main subjects are universities, business and government. They determine the dominant understanding of the innovations now. Key issues of the innovation study are the technological development and its economic efficiency.
   Modernity is the transition from the technological civilization to the human civilization (post-industrial society, information society). Values of the technological civilization are:
   -Conception of man as an activity-being individual which opposes to the nature and controls it;
   -The value of the transformative and creative activity;
   -The value of active and sovereign individual;
   -Technological manipulation of the nature as well as the society;
   -The value of innovations and progress.
   Comparison of innovative ideology values and technological civilization values shows its close relationship. The crisis of technological civilization is described. Social and anthropological characteristics of this crisis are shown. So, new values are going to appear in the nearest future. But there is a lack of understanding of social and human aspects of the innovative development. The conclusion is that there is a need to include social and human aspects to the understanding of the innovations, both in theory and in practice. Social and philosophical research community have to made problematization of the innovative development and its risks. Innovation management as a practice of decision-making should take this into consideration. Subjects of the philosophy and sociology of technology, social philosophy, anthropology, cultural studies have to be considered.
   Innovation study is an interdisciplinary field of knowledge. In the frame of it there is a great potential of the connection of the knowledge from the different social and humanity areas. Methodological features of the innovation studies are unstructured of its subject, blurring of its borders, and lack of its terminological integrity

AB Innovative development is currently being used as an effective means of overcoming the crisis in the regions. World experience shows, that an important role in innovation development of the region occupies University as a generator of innovations. The article presents the results of applied research, which was held in Veliky Novgorod. Were studied the events, trends and problems of interaction of Novgorod state University Yaroslav-the-Wise (NovSU) with the local community. On the basis of the system analysis and interdisciplinary methodology (content-analysis, case-study, SWOT-analysis, expert poll) there were analyzed the characteristics and trends of influence of activity of the NovSU on the opportunities and prospects of innovative development of the Novgorod region. In General, on an example of the Russian region had been received confirmation of the fact that the universities and the local community is not enough interact with each other. Confirmed and the poor use of the scientific potential of universities in regional industries, and lack of sustainable institutional practices of interaction of innovative potential of the higher school with the local community. In the formation of the innovative environment of the region is crucial position of regional authorities. As the survey shows, the regional authorities are implementing a number of measures on transition to the intensive type of development of economy. The regional government gives preference to high-tech industries, carries out effective investment policies and the development of small business. However, in the region there is a need for integrated and comprehensive support in the region of innovative projects, innovative environment, innovative enterprises. The author stresses that in the region are slowly developing industrial clusters, in spite of the fact, that the cluster is the most optimal form for innovative development of any scope of activity. In the NovSU there are institutions and the conditions for innovations (centers for support and maintenance of the innovation, Technopark), soon to be completed the construction of a business-incubator, which will help the development of innovations. The University actively influences the formation of innovative enterprises, among which a special role has branch IT- technologies, carries out scientific-research work for the enterprises of city and region, carries out expert activities. But in the local community University is considered, first of all, in the form of a structure of higher professional education. The author noted the negative impact of the lack of research funding from the state, as well as the existing gap between research and practice. The article also analyzes the problems, which inhibits the innovative development of the Novgorod region. Among them the most important is the problem of inconsistency of actions of the power, science, business in respect of the innovative development of the region.

TI APPROACHES TO AN OPERATSIONALIZATION OF THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN RESOURCE

DT Article
DE human resource; human capital; resource approach; forms of the capitals;
   converting of the capitals
AB The purpose of the article is to consider the basic concept of human resource and possible approaches to its operationalization in the context of management practice.
   Key factors in the emergence of the concept of human resource were processes of complication in economical, social, cultural and political life, which showed many of the system laws, not so obvious before. This processes led to the priority of human capital in economic activity. Two major forms of human capital were identified by G. Becker and T. Schultz. Those forms were associated with the presence of both general and specific skills. The question of rents, the workers with specific skills are entitled to obtain, was also raised.
   Another important factor in the approval of the concept of human resource is the UN Development Program (UNDP), first set out in the World Report "Human Development" in 1990 (UNDP, 1990), which set out the main human development indicators (wealth, life expectancy and educational attainment), which are the goals and criteria of social progress.
   This leads to the concusion that within the different terminological and conceptual contexts attention is drawn to the same phenomenon - the transformation of the various characteristics of the individual, that previously have not acted in a large scale as important types of resources in a modern society into the assets, which produce impact upon the economic situation, the life chances and contain individual risks at the same time. New types of resources arising from the terms of socialization, behavior, general cultural level etc., previously considered only as a consequences of economic status, are gaining immense importance in the changing environment.
   Generalizing over the main aspects of the resource approach, developed by M. Bourdieu, M. Castells, W. Beck and analyzing the findings of Russian sociologists representing the paradigm of stratification (T.I. Zaslayskaya, V.V. Radaeva, N.E. Tikhonova), the author offers an interpretation of the human resource as interdependent and convertible into the other forms of potential and assets.
   The approach to the review of the concept of human resources in the research and management practices is proposed. Three possible areas of operationalization of the activity of the management of human resources, which can considerably increase its efficiency, indicated in the article are:
   - study and measurement of human resource;
   - strategy and forecasting development;
   - operational steps.

DE habitus; dispositions; system; structure; hierarchy
AB The article reveals general interpretations of the concept "disposition" which have developed in philosophical, social and humanities' traditions. This interpretations seem to be the most settled and perspective ones. The issue of ability to treat habitus as hierarchical structure or integral unity of dispositions is being resolved. The author concludes that structural and hierarchical approach is invariant aspect of the analysis habitus as whole system of dispositions. Integrity of habitus as sets of a disposition means its basic irreducibility to separate elements, in particular to social or cognitive aspects. The structuredness which appears as the invariant characteristic of the system, meaning set of stable relations and the relations providing preservation of the main properties of system at various external and internal changes is inherent in Gabitus as system. Assuming preliminary work on establishment of equivalence between heterogeneous factors, allows to comprehend stabilization which never happens final. Interdependence of habitus and environment is shown in its forming and at the same time acting as a leading and active component of structuring. In this relation is the mechanism by means of which subjects, generalizing and activating the actions, form structures, and, on the contrary, thanks to which integrity is deconstructed and it is differentiated. Consideration habitus as systems allows to interpret its role as creative and active, instead of unambiguously dependent and derivative. Hierarchy means opportunity to consider system elements as subsystems, but only as the analytical scheme dictated by research problems. Cognitive, linguistic, strategic and moral aspects can be subjected to the independent analysis, on condition of recognition of their dependence on the generating beginning, i.e. habitus as whole system.

AB This paper is about mobilization campaign against gender equality law that was a result of the proposal this law under the second consideration in January 2012. We examine, firstly, what the participants of this protest campaign declare, secondly, what they do to gain their goals and then we bring to light the contradiction of this mobilization campaign. Accomplish this we have to answer two questions: 1) what the main reasons to criticize the idea of gender equality and appropriate bill; 2) what pattern of femininity is constructed by female participants of this protest campaign.
   Giving the answer to the first question on the strength of our empirical data we outline the main mobilizing frames within which the gender equality bill is considered. We have outlined three discursive strategies that are used by the activists of this campaign in order to mobilize citizens against the gender equality law: 1) family and national safety; 2) "gender" as unnatural and normative heterosexuality; 3) nation building and the institute of the Russian Orthodox Church. Conducted analysis shows that in the rhetoric of this protest the normative femininity is connected with the notion of family that understood as a registered heterosexually marriage the purpose of which is childbearing. This union is a hierarchically organized, paternalistic family with functional gender roles where men and women are prescribed with instrumental and expressive roles respectively. The orthodox religion is also essential for defense and legitimization of the traditional gender order. Normative femininity in the activists' rhetoric is reduced to maternity and private; it is attributed such characteristics as modesty, passivity, subordination, etc.
   The second task of the mobilization campaign against gender equality bill's observation is to study out to what extant in their collective actions activists follow the principals that they protect. Here we consider the case of social movement organization "Family, love, Fatherland" conducted a broad protest campaign during this mobilization. This analysis have shown that the pattern of femininity demonstrated by the participants of this mobilization at the level of action could be opposite to that they consider as normative one.

AB Over the past ten years, the leaders of the CSTO and the NATO stated that these organizations have two areas of cooperation: the fight against transnational terrorism in Afghanistan and the maintenance of stability in Central Asia. The dangers of 'Taliban' and 'Al Qaeda' have prompted Russia to accept NATO's military presence in Central Asia. The security situation has changed in the region since 2009. NATO fears that Russia uses the CSTO mechanisms for the extrusion of the alliance from Central Asia. Moscow fears that NATO is not trying to stop the opium production in Afghanistan, but to establish a military and political dialogue with the Central Asian countries bypassing Russia. These trends have worsened after the NATO's Lisbon summit in 2010, which adopted the decision to withdraw the alliance forces from Afghanistan. Nevertheless, both the CSTO and NATO need to create new institutional mechanisms for enhancing their dialogue, and perhaps co-operation, on a wide range of regional issues.

   Union; energy sector; energy security; natural gas; LNG; gas pipeline;

AB In the context of regional gas infrastructure development this paper considers the issue of energy security of the countries of East Baltic, which depend heavily on a single energy supplier - Russia. In recent years, the countries of the region have announced several LNG terminal construction projects. The European Union will provide political and financial support to only one of these projects. The paper explores the role of gas and energy in the economy of the Eastern Baltic countries. The author concludes that the countries mostly dependent on Russian gas are Lithuania and Latvia. The announced LNG terminal projects are being reviewed in detail. Their necessity is estimated from the perspective of the current and future demand for natural gas, including the terms and conditions of contracts concluded with OAO Gazprom. Different scenarios and prospects for individual LNG terminal projects and associated pipeline infrastructure are evaluated. It is shown that the inability of countries to find a political compromise on this issue and the terms of existing contracts for Russian gas, as well as low domestic demand for gas hamper the implementation of a regional LNG terminal project even in the long term.

AB This article introduces the papers from two video conferences recently held between philosophers at Moscow State University and the University at Albany, State University of New York. The overarching theme is philosophical progress in the past fifty years, but the conferences were designed also to illustrate the range of work now being done by American analytic philosophers and by Russian thinkers. The Albany essays focus on philosophy of science, philosophical logic, Kantian studies, applied ethics, and ethical and political theory. The Russian essays concern philosophy of culture, philosophy of mind, phenomenology, social philosophy, feminism, and postmodernism. This introductory essay notes similarities and differences that exist among American and Russian approaches to philosophy and the prospects for the convergence (or not) of these approaches. It also indicates ways in which contemporary Russian thinkers are striking out in new directions while seeking to recover those parts of their past that were silenced during much of the twentieth century.

AB Percy Ersnt Schramm (1894-1970) was an expert on the history of medieval corporations and political symbolism, and one of the founders of the 'new political history'. The international co-operation of historians under the Nazi regime changed dramatically as scholarly contacts became dangerous. The communication network of the German historian was destroyed, and he was forced to severe some of his ties.

DT Article

   theory of the gift by L Hyde; political and philosophical comparative

AB The paper describes the "human-state" concept formulated by the philosopher M.K. Petrov. The author shows the controversies of the concept. A complex of the opposite assertions is stated in the article: religious eschatology is not associated with psychological stress before the attack; the process of creativity training is free from administrative longing for omniscience; the genesis of science is not related to the activities of the pirates and their creative and destructive campaigns at the agrarian state; creativity is the product of free choice, not the result of the pressure of circumstances; making scripture of any text by canonization does not block the universal ability of creativity; the sum of technologies has changed from antiquity to the VII century; any rationalization opens the way for the new; sociality does not consist of stabilizing and creative elements; there is no connection between the agricultural community and the state apparatus; the development of society is associated with the use of individuals' talents to ensure stability; the civil virtues exists independently of the relationship between professional and public skills: the state is needed even if it does not provide security for individuals; the competition between the state, the pirates and agriculture does not exist; the state is indifferent to the problem of its own survival; pirates and farmers are the creators of statehood; the state apparatus must not correspond to abilities of a person, but a person must be adjusted to its requirements; a city does not consists of many individuals-states, and the legislative and executive activity has nothing to do with them. In order to resolve the dispute the author places it in the context of Fernand Braudel's historiographical concept and Lewis Hyde's theory of the gift.

In parallel, the article points to some limitations of numismatics as a historical source. The author points to the impossibility to formulate a patterned approache, rules, and regulations, which observance in numismatic research would always lead to the obtaining of all necessary and standardized information. The numismatic objects are polyparametric, and in most cases their parameters appear to be informative and may be disclosed only in specific historical situations of the particular historical periods and of the particular states.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE democracy; state regulation; political management; political regulation;
   politico-administrative dichotomy; politicization of the state;
   political technologies
AB Not so long ago political science was departing from the paradigm of political subjects' self-existence, viewing political processes as self-regulating. Gradually, however, the idea installed itself, of the possibility of consciously exerting influence upon the behavior of political actors by means both of local use of regulatory technologies and of broad (up to total, as in Russia) purposeful organization of political space. Consequences of new correlation of "policy" and "regulation" can be observed both in the academic search and in the political practice. Failing to find any suitable equivalent in English for naming Russian realias, our home researchers are, for example, finding out differences between "political management" and "political regulation". Meanwhile political colonization of the state and massed use of political technologies by Russian politicians have become bases for the formation of a system of "regulated democracy"

Local traditions and political cultures actualized various aspects of the concept of liberalism: intellectual, industrial, doctrinal, futuristic. The hierarchy of the values of liberalism also demonstrates regional variations.

AB The study focuses on the question: for what reason do some scientific or art works immediately and easily obtain acknowledgement both of public at large and of narrow professional groups, while the rest become known only within one of these groups? What is the role of political class in this process? What mechanisms make literary, art and scientific works gain extraordinary weight in the society? Finally, what are the roots of the change in relation to art and its subjects in the last decades? On the basis of political analysis performed by the author a conclusion can be drawn that current obstacles on the path of science and art will yet be overcome.

AB Turkey and the Black Sea straits are the territories where the interests of different states and competing geopolitical forces have been always crossed. The Turkish government played a big diplomatic game in Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. The example of Turkey being outside the interests of the USA before World War II gives an opportunity to trace the stages of the involving of the US to the political processes in the region. The article is devoted to the US -Turkish relations on the eve of World War II, and especially to the US' attitude to the Turkish policy of neutrality. A particular attention is paid to the history of bilateral relations between Ankara and Washington in the context of Turkey's relations with London, Berlin and Moscow at the early stages of World War II.

AB Proposed text is a continuation of the article "Legal etatism as a modus vivendi; Russia (look through the crisis)," published in the journal "Problems of Philosophy". 2010. No 4. The basic idea is to justify the fact that the Russian political system should be built in the new democratic the legal paradigm. The essence of it is in the transition from democratic of law to democratic legitimacy. In the establishment of law in Russia during this period can be seen as a kind of construct and maintain order "above" and "below" through social and political consensus of people and social trade-offs involved everyone in the law-making process.

AB Concepts of democracy are reinterpreted by the author within the frameworks of the theological and of the organic paradigms. He has recourse to vast historical and sociological argumentation to substantiate the conclusion that democracy (civil self-government) on the local level is the natural condition of social organization, which provides efficient economic and cultural development of community. The author asserts that the new generation of Russian citizens will pave the way to civil self-government and political democracy.
