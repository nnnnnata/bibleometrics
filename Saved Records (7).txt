AB Green economy development strategies and the transition from conventional economic development models to green economy has become necessary due to the negative impact of conventional economic development models on the local and global environment. Despite Ghana's effort to transition to green economy that is made evident by the implementation of a number of green economy related policies and strategies, the country is yet to record any significant achievement in that regard. This study therefore used the SWOT analytical tool to access the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats of Ghana's green economy transformation efforts. The results revealed that the country's geographical location, environmental policies, potential for green energy mix, a young and dynamic population, the country's effort to reduce poverty levels and illiteracy rates are the main strengths. However, factors such as weak institutions, inadequate funding for green technologies innovations, inadequate long term policies for green strategies and inadequate political will are some key weaknesses. The study further found commercial interests in driving the development and transfer of green technology, cross-border collaborations and global attention to climate change, local and international support for green economy, awareness and understanding of environmental protection as some of the major opportunities. Inadequate commitment to support technology development and transfer, cost of green technologies, increasing threat of climate change and corruption were identified as threats to Ghana's effort to green its economy. In conclusion, it is imperative that policy makers develop strategies that can help take advantage of the strengths and opportunities while serving as solutions to the weakness and threats. Among other things, it is important for policy makers to prioritize science and technology education to support green economy development. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB This paper is a replication and extension of Buitenzorgy and Mol (2011). We recreate the data and analyses from that paper on the impact of democracy on deforestation from 1990 through 2000 with great precision before extending the data set and analyses to include the period from 2000 through 2010. We find that the original results of Buitenzorgy and Mol (2011) were spurious and inconsistent in the replication once heteroskedasticity robust standard errors were employed. When combining the two time periods and running analyses on panel data and differenced data for robust outcomes and better policy inferences, we find different results for the effect of democracy on deforestation, indicating that model specification is critical to studying this relationship. The more econometrically sound method, the differenced models, reject the Environmental Kuznet's Curve (EKC) hypothesis for democracy and deforestation, instead indicating that democracy decreased deforestation rates. When adding democracy spillover effects to the model, i.e., the impact on deforestation rates due to changes in democracy levels in neighboring countries, we still find that democracy leads to decreased rates of deforestation. We also find that having more democratic neighbors leads to further decreases in democracy. These outcomes have far-reaching implications for the blocs examined, which are highlighted in this study.

AB Scholars of nationalism knew about the role of memory and forgetting in nation building long before the contemporary boom of memory studies. Still, they can learn a lot from this relatively new research field. This article offers an overview of the literature on the politics of memory, focusing on different patterns of dealing with a dark past of genocides, civil wars, and political repressions, on the one hand, and on the observations derived from the recent so-called "memory wars" in Europe, on the other. Both issues elucidate a persistent role of nationalism in the contemporary world.

ID PARADOXES
AB The article is devoted to considerations of early Wittenstein's views on the problem of logical paradoxes. The most well-known way of solving logical paradoxes is the hierarchical approach. First, Russell developed the theory of types in which paradoxes were solved at the level of revealing correct forms of thinking, and then Tarski formulated the semantic conception of metalanguages, in which paradoxes were solved at the level of revealing correct forms of representation of thinking in language. The main methodological step used in this hierarchical approach to solving the problem of paradoxes is prohibiting the phenomenon of self-reference. Russell's theory of types regards as logically incorrect such concepts and methods of reasoning the formation of which relies on the phenomenon of self-reference. Tarski's conception of metalanguages forbids mixing the object language and the metalanguage, which itself becomes the object language for the next-level metalanguage. Self-reference in language is possible only when the object language and the metalanguage are mixed, and, in Tarski's conception, this situation is considered semantically incorrect. Although the hierarchical approach is still considered the most orthodox way of solving logical paradoxes, it is increasingly criticized in the research literature on logic, epistemology, and the philosophy of mathematics in the last decades of the 20th century and in the early 21st century in which various shortcomings of Russell's and Tarski's positions are pointed out. The author of this article draws attention to the special position of Wittgenstein in the context of discussion on the problem of logical paradoxes he expressed in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and other writings of the early period of his philosophy. The author asserts that Wittgenstein's position proves to be invulnerable to modern critics of the hierarchical approach.

ID MANIPULATION; SELECTION; GROWTH; INCOME
AB Candidates often tout their private sector experience when running for public office. But do businessperson politicians actually govern differently? This paper argues that given their preferences and managerial expertise, businesspeople in office adopt policies favorable to the business community and improve government efficiency. To test these claims, I collect data on over 33,000 Russian mayors and legislators and investigate policy outcomes using detailed municipal budgets and over a million procurement contracts. Using a regression discontinuity design, I find that businessperson politicians increase expenditures on roads and transport, while leaving health and education spending untouched. Prioritizing economic over social infrastructure brings immediate benefits to firms, while holding back long-term accumulation of human capital. Businesspeople also do not reduce budget deficits, but rather adopt less competitive methods for selecting contractors, particularly in corruption-ripe construction. In all, businessperson politicians do more to make government run for business, rather than like a business.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Tuvans; Tuva; limitrophe zone; civilization; Russian civilization; Inner
   Asia; intercivilizational exchange; bilingualism; Buddhism in Tuva;
   civilizational identification
AB The article sees Tuva as a limitrophe zone - that is, a territory located between civilizations, under their influence in various aspects of its sociocultural life. A limitrophe always remains a borderland and never fully becomes part of any civilizational field. This position is evident after an analysis of various aspects of the region's sociocultural life. On the one hand, for many centuries Tuva has been a part of the Buddhist, Shamanist and nomadic Inner (or Central) Asia. On the other, for the last two centuries it has also been part of the Russian civilization. In various aspects of its life, the population is dominated by different civilizational influences, which means that over a range of issues, Tuva gravitates towards different civilizational bodies.
   Building on a wide range of bibliographic material, as well as data from the empirical studies made by the author, the article examines the civilizational influences in the Tuvan linguistic sphere, as well as Tuvans' religious adherence and self-identification. In each of these spheres, the analysis covers a historical retrospection shedding light on Tuvans' historical choice over a specific issue, and on the rise and development of a certain factor.
   Linguistically, Tuvans have been found to have possessed a limited Tuvan-Mongolian bilingualism, later to be replaced by a Tuvan-Russian one. Given the generational changes, the current trend is towards the gradual rise of a Russian-Tuvan bilingualism. The linguistic influence of the Russian civilization is increasing, but also growing is the impact of the Tibetan Buddhist civilizational coinmunity which Tuvan Buddhist associate themselves with. The impact of the Chinese civilization remains minimal - unlike the political consequence the politics of the Chinese empire has led to. Tuvans also feel affinity with the Mongolian culture, but it is limited by the difference between the two languages and the language families they belong to. Tuvan religious preferences, in their turn, antagonize them from many other Turkic nations, where most people follow Islam. These and other factors contribute to the feeling of a special Tuvan ethnic identity.

AB The article reviews cooperation between the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and their collective efforts to promote reform of international financial institutions, shape global financial regulation and improve financial cooperation. The authors focus on the BRICS-G20 engagement for global economic governance reform. To assess the progress so far, the study employs original quantitative data on the BRICS and G20 commitments and compliance, and qualitative analysis of the BRICS and G20 discourse and the transformation of the international economic architecture. The results suggest that, contrary to the common perception of the BRICS as a challenger of the traditional western-dominated international monetary and financial system, it acts in a cooperative manner, seeking to make the international financial architecture and global regulation more representative and responsive to emerging markets and developing economies needs, and strengthen the stability and resilience of international and domestic financial markets.

AB We contribute to research on the democratic role of middle classes. Our paper distinguishes between middle classes emerging autonomously during gradual capitalist development and those fabricated rapidly as part of state-led modernization. To make the case for a conceptual distinction between these groups within one national setting, we employ author-assembled historical district data, survey, and archival materials for pre-Revolutionary Russia and its feudal estates. Our analysis reveals that the bourgeois estate of meshchane covaries with post-communist democratic competitiveness and media freedoms, our proxies of regional democratic variations. We propose two causal pathways explaining the puzzling persistence of social structure despite the Bolsheviks' leveling ideology and post-communist autocratic consolidation: (a) processes at the juncture of familial channels of human capital transmission and the revolutionaries' modernization drive and (b) entrepreneurial value transmission outside of state policy. Our findings help refine recent work on political regime orientations of public-sector-dependent societies subjected to authoritarian modernization.

AB Democracy is generally associated with governmental accountability, better public policy choices and public health. However, there is limited evidence about how political regime transition impacts public health. We use two samples of the states around the world to trace the impact of regime transition on public health: the first sample comprises 29 post-communist states, along with 20 consolidated democracies, for the period of 1970-2014; the second sample is a subsample of the same 29 post-communist states but only for the period of transition, 1990-2014. We find that the post-communist states experienced some decline in life expectancy in the first few years of transition (1990-1995). Yet, with a steady increase in the measure of democracy from 1995 onwards, life expectancy significantly improved and infant mortality decreased. Therefore, in the long run, democratization has had a positive impact on both the life expectancy and infant mortality of citizens of the post-communist states.

AB Recent worldwide growing awareness of the global climate changes stressed the importance of developing and supporting the renewable energy sources (RES). However, the public support for RES varies across various countries and regions, especially those abundant in traditional fossil fuels. This paper presents the analysis of the public views of the economics of the renewable energy using the results of the online survey (N = 750) conducted in several regions of the Russian Federa-tion, a country abundant in natural gas and oil. Our results indicate that there is a mixed opinion on trust in RES as opposed to the traditional energy sources. Even though we found some sup-port for the renewable energy technologies, it appears that it is correlated with the respondents ' concerns about the environmental protection and sustainable development as well as with some demographic variables. The outcomes of the regression analysis confirmed that positive attitudes towards climate protection predetermined the support for various types of RES, while the financial or political gains did not come through as significant. The results indicate that public views on the renewable energy sources could and should be shaped by the information campaigns and presen-tations in mass media conducted by relevant policymakers and public authorities.

AB 'We have kicked the can down the road once again - but we are running out of road.' - Rachel Kyte, Dean of Fletcher School at Tufts University.
   We, in our capacities as scientists, economists, governance and policy specialists, are shifting from warnings to guidance for action before there is no more 'road.' The science is clear and irrefutable; humanity is in advanced ecological overshoot. Our overexploitation of resources exceeds ecosystems' capacity to provide them or to absorb our waste. Society has failed to meet clearly stated goals of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Civilization faces an epochal crossroads, but with potentially much better, wiser outcomes if we act now.
   What are the concrete and transformative actions by which we can turn away from the abyss? In this paper we forcefully recommend priority actions and resource allocation to avert the worst of the climate and nature emergencies, two of the most pressing symptoms of overshoot, and lead society into a future of greater wellbeing and wisdom. Humanity has begun the social, economic, political and technological initiatives needed for this transformation. Now, massive upscaling and acceleration of these actions and collaborations are essential before irreversible tipping points are crossed in the coming decade. We still can overcome significant societal, political and economic barriers of our own making.
   Previously, we identified six core areas for urgent global action - energy, pollutants, nature, food systems, population stabilization and economic goals. Here we identify an indicative, systemic and time-limited framework for priority actions for policy, planning and management at multiple scales from household to global. We broadly follow the 'Reduce-Remove-Repair' approach to rapid action. To guide decision makers, planners, managers, and budgeters, we cite some of the many experiments, mechanisms and resources in order to facilitate rapid global adoption of effective solutions.
   Our biggest challenges are not technical, but social, economic, political and behavioral. To have hope of success, we must accelerate collaborative actions across scales, in different cultures and governance systems, while maintaining adequate social, economic and political stability. Effective and timely actions are still achievable on many, though not all fronts. Such change will mean the difference for billions of children and adults, hundreds of thousands of species, health of many ecosystems, and will determine our common future.

AB The COVID-19 crisis has provided an opportunity to re-evaluate how the federal relations work in authoritarian Russia. In particular, the crisis has confirmed that the regional governors are an integral part of maintaining the stability of the non-democratic regime. Since the whole system and thus, the political careers of the incumbent governors depend on Putin's popularity, they are interested in maintaining it, even at the expense of their own popularity with the population. In Spring 2020 the regional governors have demonstrated both loyalty and willingness to shield Putin from political responsibility for unpopular measures associated with the epidemic.

AB Globally, policy environments have become increasingly more complex with the growth in the number of wicked problems, such as that posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In their response to these problems, public administrations have, from necessity, become heavily reliant on their intergovernmental relations systems, as the challenges posed generally require multilevel responses. This paper analyzes the role of intergovernmental relations in shaping the responses of the BRICS countries when confronted with COVID-19. We develop an analytical framework to understand the dynamics of intergovernmental relations in these countries. Based on this we assess the capacity of the state and political systems to manage intergovernmental relations and ensure effective responses to the COVID-19 crisis. This framework is based on an analysis of three dimensions of the policy domain: the political and state system, formal and informal institutions, and the political alignment between them. Whilst state and political systems were found to be instrumental in formulating an immediate response to the crisis, informal institutions and political processes also played a prominent role in determining the extent to which strategies were implemented, particularly in countries that are more decentralized. Countries lacking the robust formal institutions needed to facilitate intergovernmental relations and to ensure swift policy responses, tend to deliver ineffective and inefficient results when confronted with wicked problems.

AB Over the past decades, the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) countries have experienced significant economic growth. However, their political voices in global governance have not grown on par with their economic surge. The contributions to the symposium 'The BRICS, Global Governance, and Challenges for South-South Cooperation in a Post-Western World' argue there is a quest for emerging markets and developing countries to play a more significant role in global governance. There is a widening gap between the actual role of emerging markets and developing countries in the global system and their ability to participate in that system. However, for the moment, various domestic and international political-economic challenges limit this quest. To understand why this is the case, one should understand the BRICS phenomenon in the broader context of the global power shift towards the Global South.

AB This paper reports the findings of a study of two automatically generated corpora of multimodal digital items user-tagged as 'Black Lives Matter memes' and 'Blue Lives Matter memes'. The central aim is to flesh out the memetic trends representing the discourses and ideologies on the Black and blue memescape, which is explored in the wake of the most infamous but interest-generating tragedy in the history of the Blue Lives Matter movement, namely George Floyd's death at the hands of white police officer Derek Chauvin. Studied through a Multimodal Critical Discourse Analytic lens, the internet memes are shown to contribute to the polyvocal political discussion and, with some neutral or ambiguous exceptions, to display a positive (pro-) or - more often - negative (anti-) stance on each of the opposite movements (with anti-BLM items consituting the largest category in the dataset). Also, contrary to the well-entrenched conceptualisation of memes as a type of humour, the majority of the memes at hand manifest no humorous potential. Humour is present mainly among the negative-stance memes, which points to the disparagement of a target as a concomitant of humour in the memes on this serious political topic.

AB We study the set of possible joint posterior belief distributions of a group of agents who share a common prior regarding a binary state and who observe some information structure. For two agents, we introduce a quantitative version of Aumann's agreement theorem and show that it is equivalent to a characterization of feasible distributions from a 1995 work by Dawid and colleagues. For any number of agents, we characterize feasible distributions in terms of a "no-trade" condition. We use these characterizations to study information structures with independent posteriors. We also study persuasion problems with multiple receivers, exploring the extreme feasible distributions.

AB Recent inclusion of the issue of economy decarbonization in the global agenda has been affecting social and political priorities. To lower greenhouse gas emissions, Russian economy has to reduce anthropogenic emissions and maximise the carbon sequestration potential of national forests. The paper demonstrates that Russian forest ecosystems compensate for more than a quarter (almost 27 %) of anthropogenic emissions. However, due to the absence of a reliable, time-tested forest inventory system in Russia, as opposed to leading countries, it is difficult to ensure the sustainable use of forest resources and full accounting of greenhouse gas absorption by forests. The research analyses systemic measures to improve the absorptive capacity of Russian forests as a key element of the mechanism for compensating industrial greenhouse gas emissions, since the global expert community should recognise the contribution of these forests to the global climate change mitigation. Potential economic benefits of increasing the carbon-absorbing capacity of forests are assessed at the regional level. The example of Irkutsk oblast shows that the calculated effect of the analysed measures can amount to 6-7 dollars/ha at the current price of carbon credits; full implementation of these measures in the region can bring up to 480 million US dollars annually, net of expenses. The research proposes to ensure the necessary quality and completeness of data of the State Forest Registry by integrating remote and ground-based field measurements. It is also suggested to enhance institutional and investment support to state forest conservation initiatives, including in the framework of the National Project "Ecology" and forest-climate projects based on public-private partnerships. These measures should be included in the reform of public policy in the field of forest management.

AB This study investigates the effect that formal education, as a factor of socio-economic development, has on the intensity and forms of political protest. By way of increased socialization of democratic values, increased cognitive understanding of the society at large, and human capital to participate in protests, increases in a country's level of formal education should theoretically lead to increased levels of peaceful protest. However, increases in formal education are also theorized to play a mitigating role on the intensity of violent protests (riots) for the previously mentioned reasons as well as the fact that education acts as a strong factor in increasing social mobility. With data from 1960 to 2010 and spanning 216 countries, our empirical tests demonstrate a significant positive relationship between formal education and the intensity of anti-government protests at the early stages of socio-political development and a strong negative relationship between education and riots along the full range of data, with the later stages of development revealing a particularly strong negative correlation.

ID HEALTH
AB Introduction: Health and social care systems in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries have undergone significant changes and are currently dealing with serious problems of system disintegration, coordination and a lack of control over the market environment.
   Description: The increased health needs related to the ageing society and epidemiological patterns in these countries also require funding needs to increase, rationing to be reformed, sectors to be integrated (the managed care approach), and an analytical information base to be developed if supervision of new technological approaches is to improve. The period of system transitions in CEE countries entailed significant changes in their health systems, including health care financing.
   Discussion: Large deficits in the public financing of health systems were just one of the challenges arising from the economic downturn of the 1990s, which was coupled with inflation, increasing unemployment, low salaries, a large informal sector and tax evasion in a number of CEE countries. During the communist period, there was universal access to a wide range of health services, proving it difficult to retain this coverage. As a result, many states sought to ration publicly funded health services for example, through patient cost-sharing or decreasing the scope of basic benefits. Yet, not all of these reform plans were implemented, and in fact, some were rolled back or not implemented at all due to a lack of social or political consensus.
   Conclusion: CEE health systems had come to practice implicit rationing in the form of under-the-table payments from patients, quasi-formal payments to providers to compensate for lack of funding, and long waiting lists forcing patients to the private sector. All these difficulties pose a challenge to the implementation of integrated care.

AB Purpose In this study, as part of an attempt to foster sustainable development, the aim is directed at understanding the perspectives of domestic economic, financial and political risks in tourism development. On the other hand, the role of other agents of sustainable development: innovation, infrastructure, health and primary education and global crisis in tourism development, was illustrated. Design/methodology/approach To achieve this objective, the current study explored the (system) SYS-Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) technique for a panel of selected 73 economies over the period 2006-2017. This GMM approached is not undertaken without first establishing the stationarity (a preliminary test) of the employed dataset by utilizing the relevant unit root techniques. Findings First, the study found that minimizing risks from economic, financial and political aspects is significant and vital to the attractiveness of the tourism destinations and the eventual development of the tourism sector. Second, the study presents innovation or technological readiness and health and primary education as agents of sustainable development through the growth of international tourism arrivals while global crisis is significantly detrimental to tourism inflow. Originality/value Overall, the study presents the contribution of tourism as a pathway to sustainable development from unique dimensions. Investigating a large panel (of 73 countries) is a unique approach. In addition, considering the economic vulnerability of the panel countries from the aspects of risk arising from economic, financial and political aspects is another interesting dimension to the novelty of the study. Thus, this study offers relevant policies for tourism stakeholders.

AB Demographic changes associated with the transformation from traditional to advanced economies are the basis for many of today's theories of violent and non-violent protest formation. Both levels of urbanization and the size of the "youth bulge" have shown to be reliable measures for predicting protest events in a country. As these two processes result from modernization, it seems logical to hypothesize that the combined effect of the rise in urbanization and the increase in the youth population, urban youth bulge, would be a more relevant predictor for protests. Our tests on cross-national time-series data from 1950 to 2010 for 98 countries reveal that the combined effect of the two forces is an important predictor of anti-government protests. It may seem that the role of the urban youth bulge would appear to be an issue of the past as in more recent decades the proportion of the urban youth tends to decline in most countries of the world. However, this factor tends to be very relevant for many developing countries where both youth bulges have been growing for several decades and the general urban population is on the rise.

AB Based on surveys by the Institute of Sociology of the Federal Scientific Center for Scientific Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences for 2014-2021, the authors analyzed the statics and dynamics of Russians' trust in state and public institutions. It is shown that the correlation of trust in different institutions demonstrates the lack of rootedness in political democracy in Russia, since citizens systematically trust the institutions of the "vertical of power" more, with much weaker trust associated with political competition. At the same time, Russians most often do not have confidence in the majority of both, and for more than 50% of Russians, trust is consistently observed only in the president and in the army. At the same time, the level of institutional trust is changing in waves: if in the mid-2010s it reached its maximum, then it began to decline. Using the example of antiquarian measures, it is shown that institutional trust is a social capital that brings benefits to society. In particular, citizens with higher trust in the president showed increased loyalty to antiquarian measures and, as a result, were less likely to get sick. Thus, although the characteristics of the social capital of Russians associated with institutional trust significantly complicate the long-term modernization of the Russian nation, they are still sufficient to significantly smooth out the negative effects of the coronavirus crisis in the medium term.

AB The article examines the crisis of modern Western democracy. It is noted that the important causes of the crisis are slowing down of economic growth and deepening inequality in developed countries. It is shown that inter-party competition inevitably generates a mechanism of degradation of moral norms in the political sphere and reduction of the political system efficiency. These processes have intensified dramatically as a result of the spread of the Internet. They contributed to the reduction of citizens' participation in political life and at the same time to the ochlocratization of the political system. It is shown as well that a number of transformations taking place in the Western countries are aimed at improvement of interaction mechanisms between the state and society and contribute to overcoming the crisis. These include expanding the role of parliamentary committees, increasing the number of parties, large-scale reforms of public sector governance basing on collaboration. In this context, the experience of e-platforms and the possibilities of institutional collaborative platforms are analyzed. The concept of collaborative democracy is proposed, based on the analysis of the trends studied. The mechanism for collaborative democracy should ensure greater choice and broader direct participation of citizens in decision-making, control the costs of political competition and maintain ethical standards, prevent ochlocratization and improve governance. Contours of this mechanism are outlined. It is based on the use of a proportional electoral system of a special type, a system of expert councils and collaborative platforms for public decision-making, as well as on the implementation of decision-making rules close to consensus. The significance of these conclusions for Russia is discussed.

DT Article
AB The article considers the role of Russian border controls in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impacts on immigration and customs controls and on cross-border social and economic activities. Although in March 2020 Russian border controls proved to be insufficient, they still were used as one of the main tools for immobilizing people. The sanitary bordered order contributed to social exclusion of marginalized groups. Meanwhile, those who had money, access to decision-making, eligible immigration status, ability to make their voices heard, or access to advanced knowledge on travel logistics still had some options to move across the "closed border."

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Many governments have seen digital health technologies as promising tools to tackle the current COVID-19 pandemic. A much-talked example in this context involves the recent deluge of digital contact tracing apps (DCT) aimed at detecting Covid-19 exposure. In this short contribution we look at the bio-political justification of this phenomenon and reflect on whether DCT apps constitute, as it is often argued, a serious potential breach of our right to privacy. Despite praising efforts attempting to develop legal and ethical frameworks for DCT apps' usage; we argue that such endeavours are not sufficient to tackle the more fundamental problem of mass surveillance, which will remain largely unaddressed unless we deal with the biopolitical arguments presented and resort to a technical and structural defence.

ID POPULISM
AB Social cleavages and their political projections are key systemic elements in the evolutionary transformations of modern societies. Cleavage theory seeks to reflect the ambiguous and dynamic realities of contemporary divisions, but concepts and notions describing them often remain unclear. An overview of the mainstream theoretical and methodological approaches to assessing social and political divisions in contemporary societies indicates three key analytical standpoints: a) classical theory of social cleavages and their political projections (following Stein Rokkan and Seymour Martin Lipset); b) the politicization of new social divisions and of their potential transformation into competitive resources for promoting political projects; and c) political divides as drivers of social development. A correlation of these approaches can contribute to promoting a complex methodology of assessing political transformations in a rapidly changing contemporary world order. Economic and social inequality, cultural divides, and contentious politics are important indicators of growing divisions, alongside an ardent public discussion and a consistent research agenda on cultural and socio-political polarization. The authors consider institutionalized political divisions between identity groups (in the logic of Arend Lipjhart) as one of the possible characteristics (but not the only one) of divided societies, and argue for a wider approach to this concept. Growing cleavages of different natures are integral parts of contemporary social dynamics, but not all are politically relevant: politicizing cleavages is an inherent characteristic of "divided societies", and criteria for their assessment are proposed. These criteria are applicable in the framework of both territorially localized (the nation state) and extraterritorial (non-state) communities. A cognitive map of cleavages and their political projections depicts the current state of the research field and offers insights for updating the research agenda.

DT Article
ID CORRUPTION; COMPETITION; RUSSIA; MODEL
AB Does the passage of anticorruption reforms affect the types of people that want to serve in government? This article evaluates the effects of a common tool to fight corruption-financial disclosures-using data on 25,642 elections in Putin-era Russia. I argue that financial disclosures function like a personal audit, generating information for journalists and prosecutors to investigate illicit gains earned inside and outside of government. Exploiting staggered elections, I find that requiring financial disclosures leads to roughly 25% fewer incumbents seeking reelection and 10% fewer candidates with suspicious financial histories. Greater media freedom and law enforcement capacity further increase the risk of corruption and tax evasion being uncovered, resulting in even fewer candidacies from those criminally exposed. Increasing transparency changes the incentives for serving in elected office, even in settings where other political motives may be at play.

AB Authoritarian leaders rely on regional leaders for both political support and the fulfillment of their policy objectives. In addition, top leaders face trade-offs between following established rules for managing bureaucratic officials' careers and exercising a free hand in choosing regional officials. This paper compares patterns of appointment of regional officials in Russia and China before and after 2012. In recent years, the leaders of both countries have centralized and personalized state power. We hypothesize that these changes have altered policies for managing the appointments of regional leaders in such a way as to increase their dependence on the central authorities and reduce their autonomy to create their own networks at the regional level. We analyze a comprehensive original set of biographical data on all top regional officials from 2003 through 2019 in China and from 2000 through 2019 in Russia. We discern clear differences between the pre- and post-2012 period for China and less marked differences for pre- and post-2012 Russia. Turnover of regional officials has become more frequent in both systems; average tenure in office has fallen; and the share of "outsiders" has risen. However, the corps of regional officials has not been rejuvenated.

AB The main task of authoritarian elections is to guarantee the survival of the regime. Achieving this goal, authoritarian rulers rely on authoritarian electoral mobilization that is employed by political machines, targeted mostly on poor and dependent voters. At the same time, since electoral autocracies permit opposition parties, those voters, who avoid mobilization, are able to make a choice between the government and the opposition. If they are dissatisfied by their personal or social conditions, they are liable to engage in 'performance voting' and give their support to the opposition. In this article, we examine how the two logics of 'mobilized voting' and 'performance voting' relate to each other. The study is based on a large-N analysis of local level variations in the electoral support of Russia's three systemic opposition parties in 2016 Duma elections, and a unique dataset comprised of electoral and social-economic data, from local (municipal) units.

AB This paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence on political connections of Russian corporations based on a sample of companies for the period 2011-2015 (divided into subsamples before and after the events in Ukraine). Based on a unique database, the study (1) evaluates how common political connections are for Russian corporate environment, and (2) investigates the impact of political connections on firm value through an event study. The research shows that 27% of Russian corporations from the sample had the top officials of Russia as directors, and 43% of corporations were found to be politically connected on the basis of either state ownership or directorship. Political connections are unevenly distributed among industries, and regulated industries are more heavily politicized. Aviation, oil & gas, and banking were the most politically connected sectors of the Russian economy. The event study showed that political connections have a value-destructive total effect which is statistically significant and robust. Generally, the stock market responds to announcements of political connections with a drop in share prices by 1.34% on average within 5 trading days. Different groups of stakeholders exert different impacts on firm value. The most negative influence on firm value is that of politically connected owners. The stock market reacts to acquisitions of shares by politically connected owners with a drop in stock prices by 1.82% within 5 trading days, and with a drop in stock prices by 4.3% when the politically connected owners were individuals. The negative value effect of political connections strengthened after the events in Ukraine. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dense networks are supposed to allow political machines to solve the "commitment problem" that is typical for electoral mobilization. Highlighting the effect of dense networks, we study the features of local communities that facilitate their emergence: countryside, small size of a settlement, and "segregated" type of ethnic groups' localization in relation to each other. On the ground of the 2016 Duma elections, an original dataset based on local-level data and GIS techniques, we examine these attributes of local units in the combination with ethnic structure, and find moderator-type effects that indirectly prove the importance of dense networks in electoral mobilization.

To what extent is science in its specificity a boon to the rest of society? And what is this benefit: intellectual, utilitarian or moral? To what extent does society - the state, private capital or individuals - have the rights to science as its property? What is the person that makes science and enjoys its gifts? While answering these questions, it is necessary to distinguish between two meanings of science as a public good in Russian- and English-language literature. The expression Nauka kak obshchestvennoe blago [Science as a public good] in Russian is not identical with the English "Science as a public good": literal translation does not work. The reason for this disagreement between Russian and English is the difference in attitude to science. In Russian philosophy, the problem is traditionally put in terms of ideological and utilitarian functions of science, while in the phrase (which is not too common) "science as a public good" the emphasis is put on "good". One speaks about the advantages that science provides to society: the scientific outlook and economic well-being. The value of basic and applied science to society is accepted as something self-evident albeit different. On the one hand, science acts as something speculative, optional for life and detached from it: it is about the ideal value of science as a subject matter of moral discourse. This is dictated by the transcendental-publicistic tradition of Russian philosophy, which was not overcome by Marxist naturalism and pragmaticism because of their inconsistency, incompatibility with the practice of "real socialism". Sergei Bulgakov clearly expressed the sofiynost' [Sophianic nature] of science and at the same time its limitations in his Philosophy of Economy (2009). On the other hand, Russian Marxism was close to the utilitarian interpretation of the slogan "Knowledge Is Power", including Marx's idea of science as a productive force. In the case of the Western tradition, the focus in this phrase shifts to "public" meaning that fundamental science, unlike applied and educational sciences, cannot be the subject of private interest, because it does not bring profit, and the private interest is treated exclusively in the liberal-economic way. Therefore, no one seeks to privatize and develop science, except those states that commit themselves to financing public funds of consumption and view science as an intellectual value. In some cases, it is residual funding (Russia), in others it is a priority (South Korea). It is in this sense that basic science appears as a "social commodity" that no one buys but receives from the state for free. Therefore, social status is usually relatively low and similar to social welfare - as opposed to wages. Applied science, conversely, is interpreted within the framework of the empirical-pragmatic analytical tradition as the embodiment of experienced and useful knowledge, which promotes the production of goods and is itself the subject of commodity exchange. In this case, science is referred to as a consumer goods object, a commodity, a useful object. This is the position of classical political economy. Adam Smith wrote that much of knowledge is borrowed from other people and from other sources and is acquired in the same way as shoes are bought. This opposition is key to the social existence of modern science as knowledge and social institution.
   Its resolution requires further clarification of the status of science as a cognitive, political and moral value.

AB The article presents the results of a sociological study of the religious situation in the Republic of Tuva in 2019. The picture of the religious life in Tuva continues to become more sophisticated due to registering new organizations, mainly traditional ones - Buddhist, shamanic, and Orthodox Christian. There has been a decline in the number of Protestant organizations, but they can function without registration. In general, there is a stable inter-confessional situation. This tranquility is caused by the predominance of one denomination in the region - Buddhism and of one ethnic group - Tuvans.
   The representative survey sample comprised of 334 people. 70% of the respondents think that a person needs to be a believer. More than half of the population of the republic pays much attention to the place of religion in human life. The predominant denomination is Buddhism, but another 16% adhere to religious syncretism (Buddhism and shamanic traditions). 73% of the respondents celebrate religious holidays at home, and they do not often visit sites of worship. Most people observe religious rites only on holidays. The population considers it primarily as following the tradition to preserve the national culture.
   The respondents feel the need to get reliable information through the media. The younger generation is especially interested in it. Despite the fact that religion is an integral part of the culture of the people, most of the surveyed residents of the region consider the interference of religious leaders in political life as a negative phenomenon. According to the residents of Tuva, religious communities should perform social functions as much as possible.
   The study shows the declarative religiosity in the population of Tuva. But since it also includes the need to preserve the national culture, religiosity also performs an important social function - it leads, among other things, to the limitation of the number of interreligious marriages.

AB Electoral procedures, such as elections, voting, or opinion polling, play a pivotal role in the Russian political system. A theoretical problem for contemporary political science arises; how can this proactive recourse to the popular voice coexist with the obvious depoliticization and concentration of personal power? Describing the Russian political regime as intermediary and inferior as opposed to full democracies cannot account for its electoral enthusiasm nor its robustness and endurance. This paper reverts to the plebiscitarian theory of democracy to address these issues. Combining monarchical power with universal suffrage created the political system of the Second Empire in France, and was later thoroughly theorized in Germany during the years of the Weimar Republic. Plebiscitary democracy produces direct democratic legitimacy for a strong leader while severely reducing the role of the masses under a drastic and rapid extension of suffrage. This paper identifies key principles as well as the main contradictions of plebiscitarian regimes. Additionally, it demonstrates that the plebiscitarian ideas proposed by Max Weber and Carl Schmitt have affected the minimalist definition of democracy espoused by Joseph Schumpeter, and therefore keeps enjoying a wide influence in political science. In identifying democracy with elections, the minimalist view promotes the electoralization of political regimes and favors the contemporary rise of plebiscitarianism. The paper considers present-day Russia as a radical case of plebiscitarian politics and traces some of its key developments.

ID CORRELATION NEGLECT; POLARIZATION; UNCERTAINTY; INFORMATION; PRIMARIES;
   POLITICS; STRATEGY; MODEL
AB This paper studies, theoretically and experimentally, a model of electoral competition that allows for platforms where candidates may be ambiguous about which policy they will implement if elected. We argue that uncertainty about the policy preferences of the electorate, combined with perceived similarity of voters and candidates, can lead to the latter running on these ambiguous platforms. By appealing to voters from both ends of the spectrum, such platforms can ensure electoral success for noncentrist candidates in a sufficiently polarized society. Ambiguous platforms pose a threat to democratic representation because winning noncentrists always implement policies in favor of a minority and against the preferences of the majority. In our laboratory experiment, ambiguous platforms are chosen frequently by candidates and gain notable support from voters. Our main treatment variation provides causal evidence that ambiguous platforms are more popular among noncentrist voters if one of the candidates is a known centrist.

AB To date, an extensive scholarly literature on regional integration has paid little attention to the question of its goals. However, it is fundamental for deeper understanding the nature of the phenomena and for the decision-making process at the national, regional and international levels. The objective of this article is to reveal declared and de facto pursued goals of regional integration, and to arrange them into a coherent system. To accomplish this task this paper first provides an overview of official goals stated in the founding agreements of various regional groups, formed by developed and developing countries in Europe, Asia and Americas. Then the question of goals is explored through the lenses of the key theories of regional economic integration and their practical application. Later a similar exercise is carried out in the context of political integration theories. Finally, based on the comprehensive analysis of official declarations, major theories of regional integration and practical developments in various regions and policy fields this paper categorizes main goals of regional integration into four groups compiled along two axes: internal and external, positive and negative. They form a matrix, which endows researchers with new optics. Further exploration of different types of integration goals, especially negatively oriented ones, has a potential to expand the research program of integration studies. They may also shed light on the debate over why regional blocks of developing countries stall at the level of free trade zones or why the creation of the European monetary union did not help the EU to move to the true political union.

AB This article proposes a new explanation of the positive correlation between democracy and terrorism detected in many previous studies. It is shown that this might be accounted for by the fact that factional democracies are subjected to more terrorist attacks than the other political regimes. A positive relationship between the democratic regime and the level of terrorist activity can be obtained due to the inclusion of factional democracies in the sample of democratic states. If factional democracies are excluded from the sample, the relationship between the level of terrorist activity and the democratic regime is negative. The analysis allows to maintain that factional democracy is a rather powerful factor of a high level of terrorist activity, while non-factional democracy turns out to be rather a statistically significant predictor of a relatively low intensity of terrorist attacks.

AB The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have hit Latin America's economy and social sphere more than any other crisis in the last hundred years. Coexistence with the virus caused a wave of restrictive measures, destroyed normal mechanisms of supply and demand, collapsed production and foreign trade, dramatically worsened the financial situation of the majority of Latin Americans, exacerbated domestic political problems. The article shows that the extreme severity of the corona crisis was caused not only by its specific features but also by the pairing with other social ills inherent in Latin America: fatal miscalculations of ruling populist regimes, deep-rooted corruption, a huge informal sector of the economy. At the same time, the author attempts to understand the reality of the countries of the region in the post-COVID-19 period, what can be done to mitigate the negative effects of the epidemic. And the main thing is whether Latin American states have the resources and opportunities to get out of the crisis with a more advanced technological structure of the regional economy. As a matter of fact, in international business and expert circles it is recognized that in recent years new and extremely important economic and social phenomena of the positive order have been born in the leading Latin American states: the modernization of the business community and the strengthening of the role of tecnolatinas, the improvement of the educational level of young people and, on this basis, the qualitative improvement of human capital, the deployment of modernization processes and technological renewal of the production apparatus. The consolidation and development of these trends create unique chances to overcome the extremely unfavourable situation in which the region found itself as a result of the epidemic of coronavirus.

LA English
DT Article
DE Russia; constitutional changes; authoritarianism; personalist regime;
   bad governance
AB Among many arguments for constitutional changes presented in the wake of the 2020 campaign for the popular vote in Russia, there was the idea that "cementing" Russia's political landscape for the sake of the regime's durability would serve as a tool for improvement of quality of governance. This argument, in a way, followed the essential point of Mancur Olson describing many autocrats across the globe as "roving bandits" with their short-term time horizons and incentives for predatory behavior. To what extent may the constitutional extension of the time horizon of Russia's authoritarian regime contribute to conversion of Russia's state officials and top managers from the "roving" to the "stationary" model, in Olson's terms? On the basis of previous research, I argue that the nature of Russia's political regime-electoral authoritarianism under personalist rule-prevents such a trajectory of further evolution. Indeed, the set of constitutional changes adopted in Russia in July 2020 is likely to preserve bad governance as a mechanism of maintenance of politico-economic order, as intentionally built and developed during the post-Soviet period. While certain technocratic solutions for Russia's governance, aimed at "fool-proofing", may avert the risks of major disasters, under conditions of durable authoritarianism the use of these devices will not result in major advancements in the quality of governance. Rather, they may contribute to further decay and aggravation of the numerous vices of bad governance.

ID ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
AB Antimicrobial resistance control programmes often aim to "fix" the behaviour of antibiotic users and prescribers. Such behavioural interventions have been widely criticised in social science literature for being inefficient and too narrow in scope. Drawing on these criticisms, this article analyses how political programmes for fixing antibiotic behaviours were adapted into the practices of health-care professionals and patients in Russia. In 2018, we conducted interviews with medical doctors, pharmacists and patients in a Russian city; focusing on their practices around the policy requirement introduced in 2017 which obligated medical prescriptions of antibiotics. We conceptualised the obligatory medical prescription as a political technique which sought to change practices of self-treatment and over-the-counter sales of medications by establishing doctors as an obligatory passage point to access antibiotics. Our analysis shows that the requirement for medical prescriptions does not fulfil the infrastructural gaps that influence antibiotic practices. By navigating the antibiotic prescriptions, doctors, pharmacists and patients informally compensate for the gaps in the existing infrastructure creating informal networks of antibiotic care parallel to the requirement of obligatory prescriptions. Following these informal practices, we could map the inconsistencies in the current policy approaches to tackle AMR as a behavioural rather than infrastructural problem.

TI "KORNILOVSHCHINA" AS A "CIVIL WAR": THE APPLICATION OF THE CONCEPT IN
   THE CONTEXT OF A POLITICAL CRISIS
SO VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA-PERM UNIVERSITY HERALD-HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Civil war; Lavr G. Kornilov; "Kornilovites"; history of concepts;
   legitimizing of violence
AB The article examines the application of the concept of "civil war" during the Revolution of 1917. Attention is paid to the so-called "the Kornilov affair". We use different political dictionaries, periodicals, public appeals of main political actors, and diaries as our main sources. All political forces used the collocation "civil war", and they utilized the fear of civil war for their own purposes. The exceptions were some radical Socialists, primarily Vladimir Lenin, who, in some of his texts, described the revolution as a civil war that had already begun. On the eve of the Kornilov affair, some contemporaries assumed that the inevitable political crisis could take a form of a civil war. It is not surprising that the conflict between the Supreme Commander and the Provisional Government, which took the form of a confrontation between army formations, was characterized by people of different views as a civil war. This influenced the description of political opponents who at this stage were perceived as enemies. The Bolsheviks were not the only ones who considered it impossible to achieve any compromise with the "Kornilovites" and the "bourgeoisie". All this made it extremely difficult to create a new coalition government and limited the base of political support for Alexander Kerensky and other supporters of an agreement with the "bourgeoisie". The "Kornilov case" was an important stage of the "articulation" of the civil war. Subsequently, this created favorable conditions for the preparation of an armed uprising by the Bolsheviks, who used the new discursive situation of legitimizing violence that arose because of this crisis.

AB Demographic changes associated with the transition from traditional to modern economies underlie many modern theories of protest formation. Both the level of urbanization and the "Youth Bulge" effect have proven to be particularly reliable indicators for predicting protest events. However, given that in the course of economic development these processes often occur simultaneously, it seems logical to put forward the hypothesis that the combined effect of urbanization growth and an increase in the number of young people will be a more relevant factor for predicting protests. Our study of cross-national time series from 1950 to 2016 shows that the combined effect of these two parameters is an extremely strong predictor of anti-government protests in a single country, even more so than traditional indicators such as democratization, per capita GDP, and the level of education.

AB Some arguments of Vsevolod Ladov that hierarchical theories of language, for example, Russell's theory of types, contain a number of shortcomings, are analyzed. These shortcomings are related to ways of solving logical paradoxes. Ladov's ideas on how to overcome these shortcomings with the help of Wittgenstein's criticism in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus are considered. Ladov's statement that Wittgenstein's pictorial theory of symbolism is a radical version of the theory of types is criticized. It is argued that the pictorial theory is based on logical grammar, while the theory of types is based on semantics. This serves as a basis for doubts about the adequacy of the approach proposed by Ladov.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE human rights; political modernization; norms; values; value systems;
   electoral base of parties; public consciousness
AB In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of supporters of the priority of human rights due to the reduction in the number of supporters of the priority of the state interests in Russia. The conflict between the views of these groups is, however, not a value conflict, but the result of a different vision of the ways to achieve the desired future of Russia according to their representatives. The difference in the views of these groups on the relationship between the interests of the state and individual rights is primarily related to their socio-psychological characteristics (non-conformism, frustration due to the inability to achieve basic life goals etc.), and not with their objective position or ideological views, although the corresponding features are also seen among them. The group of supporters of the priority of the state interests has two cores (one is spontaneously patriarchal, the second has a conscious conservative ideology). As for the supporters of the human rights priority, the heterogeneity of this group is very high and continues to increase, since its expansion occurs primarily due to the residents of small and medium-sized cities, as well as older Russians. Currently, there is not a single age cohort where the number of supporters of the state interests' priority is higher than those of the human rights. Supporters of the priority of human rights are worried not so much about the values of democracy as about such socio-economic problems as deep inequalities, a cumbersome bureaucracy, uncertainty about the future etc. The composition, specificity of the views and electoral preferences of supporters of the human rights priority indicate that they cannot act as a social basis for either systemic or non-systemic opposition, although they are characterized by an increased readiness for street protests. Representatives of the groups that form the social basis for the Russian middle class are more likely to be found among the supporters of the state interests' priority.

DT Article
ID GEOPOLITICS
AB Using the approaches of critical geopolitics, the authors compare Russian official, expert and media discourses on Russian-Chinese relations and China including such issues as its domestic and foreign policies, its role in the world, economic development and military potential. To study the official political discourse, more than 300 official documents were collected, including speeches, presentations and interviews by Russian leaders from 2012 to 2019. The screening of the Vesti news programme at the "Russia-1" state federal TV channel served a basis for the media discourse analysis. A scrutiny of about 2,900 articles on China and Russian-Chinese relations found in course of screening of 2012-2019 issues of the Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a daily federal "intellectual" newspaper destined to highly educated audience that pays much attention to foreign policy, was selected as a source of information on the expert discourse. The authors conclude that there is a clear gap between the official and expert discourse on China. While most of the participants agree that there is no alternative to a partnership with the great eastern neighbour, many experts express their concerns about the growing asymmetry in the two countries' potential. This difference arises from the lack of confidence at the grassroots level as well as from the fact that some Russian partners seek to excuse their failures by blaming them on China's unwillingness to compromise. In conclusion the authors consider the influence that different discourses have on Russian public opinion using the results of national surveys and focus groups. They show that part of the elite itself, accustomed to certain doubts about the possibility of strategic cooperation with China, reproduces a sceptical attitude towards the Chinese partners.

AB How are candidates without official party affiliation able to succeed in authoritarian elections? We analyzed 1,101 independents who took part in city council elections in Russia's regional capitals between 2014 and 2018. We found that independent candidates' electoral fortunes depended both on their personal resources enabling them to attract voters' support and pre-electoral deals with the regime. We also discovered that the chances of being elected were higher for those formally independent candidates who were the regime's hidden representatives. For the latter group, the chances to win the race were boosted mostly by pre-electoral deals, rather than their personal resources.

TI The SWAMP Metaphor in Characteristics of Society
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE ethnolinguistics; semantics; phraseology; swamp; social environment
AB The article deals with the semantics of the word swamp, which can characterize the state of human society. The study is relevant due to the wide usage of such phrases as social swamp, provincial swamp, Moscow life swamp, etc. in the modern literary language. The novelty of the study is determined by the fact that currently there is no experience in a systemic interpretation of the social semantics of the word swamp. The authors have used definitional, semantic, and contextual analyses as well as lexicographic modeling. They analyzed lexical entries that helped to discover peculiarities of a lexicographic fixation of the data on the analyzed word's meaning. It has been revealed that the Old Russian dictionaries from the 12th till the late 15th centuries featured only the direct geographical meaning of the words blato and boloto ('swamp'). The use of the church Slavonicism blato meaning the moral concept of sinfulness, immorality, i.e. 'moral filth', was typical of the church-theological discourse of the 17th century, whereas the texts frequently displayed the opposition zlato ('gold') - blato ('swamp'). The first contexts where boloto ('swamp') was used to name the undesirable social environment, in which a person found themselves, were recorded in the 18th century. After that the swamp social semantics was extensively developed. The anthropological semantics of this word family managed to develop because of the base that already existed in Russian common dialects. Folk speech reveals the sources of two derivational vectors in the swamp word family: (1) 'bog, wild hard-to-reach place' > 'backwater, boondocks, remote from large centers of social life'; (2) 'locus with its inhabitants' > 'homeland'. Other European languages show similar tendencies for the swamp identification. Particularly, in German the word Sumpf ('swamp') is a part of phrases with the inner form 'go down into the swamp', meaning transition to a lower social class and moral decline. Apparently, the social evaluativity of the word swamp in the Russian literary language developed under the influence of the European languages, German in particular (via the translated literature of the post-Petrine era). Analysis of the contexts found in the Russian National Corpus helped to discover that the geographical (landscape) term swamp had developed the fanciest secondary semantics of the anthropocentric nature in the book-written tradition. The swamp metaphor is used to characterize (1) provincial backcountry, (2) lesser homeland, (3) stagnation of social and political life, (4) a society with moral perversion, (5) a group of people ruled by intrigues and dishonest methods of competition, (6) daily routine of a family. Thus, while enriching itself with new evaluative meanings and connotations embodied in phrases, in the 18th century the swamp concept gained (under the influence of European literary languages) social connotations that became stronger and more detailed in contexts of the writers and publicists of the 19th and 20th centuries.

SO RUSSIAN POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Russian Constitutional Court; constitutional amendments; authoritarian
   institutions
AB Of the 206 amendments introduced to the Russian constitution and adopted on July 1, 2020, 24 deal directly with the Constitutional Court, its organization, functioning, and the role it plays in the political system. Compared to many other, these are also rather precise and detailed, ranging from the number of judges on the bench, their nomination and dismissal, to the Court's inner procedures, new locus standi limitations, and the primacy of the Constitution over Russia's international obligations. Most changes only reproduce amendments brought to the secondary legislation over the last twenty years, and are therefore meant to preserve the status quo rather than change anything significantly. At the same time, a number of amendments aim at politicizing and instrumentalizing the Court for the president's benefit, marking a significant departure from the previous institutional development.

DE Russia; constitutional reform; law-making; State Duma; legislative bills
AB Although 4 July 2020 saw the coming into force of constitutional changes in Russia, this was far from the end of the story. Most clearly, these changes to the 1993 constitution required implementation, including through amendments to, and the writing of new pieces of, federal legislation. In part, this process was the mundane work of legal bureaucrats, tweaking and creating many pieces of legislation to reflect the new constitutional text. But the implementation process also reveals much more about the broader constitutional reform project. This article reviews the implementation process, discussing its complexity, the improvisation shown when fleshing out certain new constitutional details, its relationship with other political developments, and the chasm laid bare between Putin's promise of the rebalancing of power in his 15 January 2020 Address to the Federal Assembly versus the reality of reform in practice.

TI Wedge strategies in Russia-Japan relations
SO PACIFIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Alliances; China; Japan; Russia; US; wedge strategies
AB This article analyses wedge strategies in the context of Russo-Japanese relations. In particular, it looks at how both countries have sought to generate a dis-alignment in the opposing side, preventing further steps toward the consolidation of potentially threatening partnerships: the US-Japan alliance for Russia, and the Russia-China entente for Japan. After identifying the respective goals of Russia and Japan, the article examines the conditions that enable the success of wedge strategies. Looking at the case of Russia-Japan relations from 2012 to 2020, the article argues that a strategy constituted of a mix of positive economic and political incentives and a limited amount of coercion can succeed in producing a degree of dis-alignment in the opposing camp. Russia's strategy seems to be more productive than Japan's since Moscow has managed to minimize the effect of sanctions imposed by Japan and it has reduced political differences to mostly bilateral and regional issues. A greater level of cooperation with established partners for both Russia and Japan, and limited costs of wedging strategies, have resulted in dis-alignment but not a reversal of existing alignments. The article also indicates that in this case credibility issues do not fundamentally affect the degree of success of wedge strategies.

AB The main directions of integration processes in the post-Soviet space are analyzed in the context of their significance for the countries of the region, defined in the article as Eurasia. The essential characteristic of the concepts of "Eurasianism" and "Eurasian integration" is given. Some scientific approaches to the definition of these concepts are also presented. Particular attention is paid to the two leading international structures in the Eurasia region the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Today, the processes of implementing the ideas of Eurasianism and Eurasian integration are associated, first of all, with the development of the EAEU. But the whole picture looks inferior without taking into account the activities of the SCO. This organization aims to implement interaction between European and Asian states, and, therefore, the ideas that underlie Eurasian integration. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization claims to be actively involved in global affairs, and remains one of the most significant forces in the processes taking place in the Eurasian geopolitical space. The ideas of Eurasian integration that arose more than 100 years ago continue to be an integral part of economic and political rapprochement of the peoples of the former USSR. This process itself is not easy due to both external and internal factors. But in any case, it can be stated with confidence: the Eurasian states are trying to create integration associations in various formats, to solve issues of mutual interest with their help. And this process affects most of the states of the Eurasian continent. The future development of both individual states of Eurasia, and the entire continent as a whole, depends on results of the integration processes promoted within the framework of the EAEU and SCO.

DT Article

ID COALITIONS; GOVERNANCE
AB The quality of interaction among key urban actors, which is described by the concept of an urban regime, is a significant structural factor influencing the logic of urban conflicts. Definitions of urban regime are based on the prerequisite that cities possess large political and economic autonomy, which is a key indicator in the appearance of an urban regime appearance. Large cities in Russia exist in an authoritarian context and strongly depend on higher-level authorities. This dependence predictably reduces opportunities for the shaping of specific urban regimes. At the same time, large cities remain leading resource centres, maintaining their political, economic, and social diversity, which leads to diversity in urban regimes across Russia, especially in the extent of political competition and range of urban actors. In the article, we show a variety of urban regimes in all Russia's million-plus cities (except for Moscow and St. Petersburg), offering a typology to categorize them. The analysis is based on data of local assemblies' compositions in 2012-2020 as well as on media reports. The basic idea of the typology is based on an assessment of the degree of competition between political and economic groups. We proceed from the premise that competition is a key factor boosting the responsiveness of authorities and expanding opportunities for urban conflict participants. For the typology, we use two criteria: both the extent of business group fragmentation and political competition. In most of Russia's million-plus cities, we reveal politically non-competitive urban regimes with fragmented ('competitive authoritarian arrangement') or non-fragmented business ('encapsulated urban regime'), in which business is mostly associated with the party of power. In only one case political competition remains along with a diversity of business groups ('competitive urban regime') and in some cases, political competition is combined with the domination of one business group ('confrontational urban regime').

ID METHODOLOGY
AB The article examines the evolution of the formation of cities and urban agglomerations in the North of Russia. The aim is to identify cities that meet the criteria of "northern urban agglomeration" from the large cities in the North of Russia. We propose criteria and indicators that make it possible to distinguish urban agglomerations in the urban space; it is noted that for northern urban agglomerations the evaluation criteria can be applied less strictly and indicators less important. We analyze the urban settlement of northern Russia, focusing on northern cities, their structure and the average density of settlements; we consider separately urban-type settlements that contribute to the population density of northern territories, increasing the density of settlements. The focus is on 18 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants and four cities with a population of a hundred thousand in different years, the core cities have at least two satellite settlements, according to the criteria proposed, they correspond to the concept of an urban agglomeration core city. We consider and group the selected urban agglomerations according to the structure of satellite settlements and the population living in the zones located within 50, 100 and 150 km from the core. With the help of a review of domestic and foreign literature, we have revealed the essence and content of the category "agglomeration effect". The article identifies three types of agglomeration effects: local objects sharing; cost reduction; and labor pooling. There are two types of effects: localization (clustering) and urbanization effects; the localization effect is the result of enterprises working together in a common area, the urbanization effect is the concentration of organizations in one area, regardless of whether there is thematic proximity between them. Along with the advantages, urban agglomerations cause environmental, economic, political and social problems and pose threats to the stability of small and medium-sized cities; increasing rural deprivation; which will cause further depopulation of large parts of the country, putting the security and integrity of the country at risk.

DT Review
DE innovation; national innovation system; economic growth; institutional

ID DEA; COOCCURRENCE
AB The article analyzes some modern approaches to modeling national innovation systems that are presented in scientific literature. We use modern methods for analyzing bibliography and preparing literature reviews: co-occurrence, and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) method. With the help of this approach we conduct relational analysis of documents by systematizing and arranging keywords into special semantic clusters that reflect interest in modeling national innovation systems. The research focuses on mathematical models of national innovation systems and models that use empirical quantitative data analyzed with the help of various econometric methods based on the Russian specifics of economic development. In this regard, when searching for and analyzing relevant sources, we used the filters "Russian innovation system", "national innovation system and Russia". We have revealed that the majority of publications focuses on such aspects as digitalization, neo-industrialization, innovation policy and technology. We identify four directions for modeling national innovation systems: macroeconomic modeling of innovation systems, modeling of growth based on the development of innovation systems, modeling of innovative activity of firms, modeling of institutional factors contributing to the development of innovation systems. The national innovation system is modeled mainly through the use of indicators related to patenting, the volume of exports and the production of innovations. Factors determining the development of national innovation systems in this context include R&D and innovation expenses, investment in technology, education, infrastructure, human resources and the quality of human capital. Conclusions on the analyzed models often do not coincide regarding the role of the state in financing innovations, the role of various elements of the institutional structure of the economy, such as intellectual property rights and mechanisms for their protection, as well as the role of political factors. On the other hand, the conclusions are consistent in terms of the impact of innovation on economic growth and development: we note a positive correlation with indicators reflecting the development of national innovation systems.

DT Article
DE urban local conflict; urban political field; strategic interaction
   perspective; players; arenas
AB This article presents the results of a comparative study of urban political fields in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The empirical foundation for our analysis is the unique database of urban conflicts that took place in these two cities in 2012-2014, containing the data on the interactions of different parties involved in the negotiations of the contested urban development projects. We also rely on interviews with experts and protest leaders in Moscow and Petersburg. Building on the theory of strategic action fields and the strategic interaction perspective, we analyse Moscow and Petersburg's urban politics as distinct fields, where specific configurations of arenas, civic infrastructures, and relationships among players, participants of the political process, emerge and develop. Moscow's urban political field is characterised by the prevalence of large federal urban redevelopment projects and the notable involvement of city bureaucrats as the adversaries of protesters. Saint Petersburg, with its smaller city budget, is more oriented toward attracting business investors for redevelopment. These features of urban political fields shape the emerging configurations of players and their interactions in two cities. We analysed the interaction dynamics among players in the urban redevelopment-related conflicts and identified several scenarios: 'desperate urbanite', 'expert battle', 'strong assailant', 'weak assailant', 'fragmentation of interests', and 'broad alliance'. These scenarios involve different formats of alliances among players (or lack thereof), the prevalence of different ('formal' or 'situational') arenas, varying levels of assertiveness of players. The scenarios also differ in terms of the possible outcomes of the conflicts. 'Broad alliance' and the 'weak assailant' are associated with higher chances of protesters to succeed. The identified scenarios are ideal analytic types; in reality, elements of different scenarios can coexist in the development of a particular case.

   Bayesian methods
ID IDENTITY; SECESSION; 2ND-LANGUAGE; ATTITUDES; CONFLICT; SALIENCE;

AB Scholars often use language to proxy ethnic identity in studies of conflict and separatism. This conflation of language and ethnicity is misleading: language can cut across ethnic divides and itself has a strong link to identity and social mobility. Language can therefore influence political preferences independently of ethnicity. Results from an original survey of two post-Soviet regions support these claims. Statistical analyses demonstrate that individuals fluent in a peripheral lingua franca are more likely to support separatism than those who are not, while individuals fluent in the language of the central state are less likely to support separatist outcomes. Moreover, linguistic fluency shows a stronger relationship with support for separatism than ethnic identification. These results provide strong evidence that scholars should disaggregate language and ethnic identity in their analyses: language can be more salient for political preferences than ethnicity, and the most salient languages may not even be ethnic.

AB One of the central objectives in foresight development is increasing its effectiveness and impact upon decision-making. This paper is focused on improving the link between foresight and science, technology, and innovation (STI) policy by overcoming the barriers that stand in the way at the very beginning of a foresight study. For this purpose, the key challenges for integrating foresight into STI policy are identified, summarized and systematized. They include challenges and barriers from the external environment, internal political situation and shortcomings in the planning and implementation of foresight. For deeper understanding the connection between foresight and STI policy three types of gaps between foresight and STI policy are considered. As the possible answer to these different challenges and gaps the pre-foresight integrative methodology for STI Policy is proposed. The practical case of the Russian foresight programme is used to illustrate challenges for integrating foresight into STI policy in the real practice and their possible solution accordingly to the proposed methodology.

AB We argue that limited authoritarian regimes like Putin's Russia have to work out a delicate balance between suppressing civil society and buying its loyalty by allocating funds to the organizations willing to cooperate with the regime. Using the data on the distribution of presidential grants among civil society organizations working on human rights projects in 2017-2018, we show that organizations whose leaders take part in consultative bodies and pro-governmental organizations such as the All-Russian People's Front receive larger amounts of money on average. Organizations with links to the parliamentary parties also have some premium in grant disbursement, while affiliation with the ruling party does not increase the amount of funding. These findings imply some degree of political bias in state funding for the third sector in Russia. We also found that professionalism matters, and seasoned civil society organizations have considerably more funding than less experienced organizations in the field.

AB Workers' literary circles of the 1920s originated from the Proletkult circles. Proletkult circles were free from formal structure and controlled by liberal community writers. Period from 1926 to 1932 became a transition from proletkult communitarianism, concerned with the utopian task of innovative proletarian culture construction, to generation of a powerful corporation, replacing creative possibilities with ideology. Artistic pursuit and development of artistic development became unnecessary. Circles were led by party writers. Archive documents of All-Russian Association of the Proletarian Writers show that, until 1926, VAPP circles taught workers literature process, language, poetics and work of fellow travelers. Until 1929 the main attention was paid at the political course of the Association's management, massive participation, ideology, rejection of fellow travelers, creation of supporter's community and new members recruitment - all of the aforesaid became the central point during that time. Circles broke up after 1932. Fear of being accused of collaboration with the Association of the Proletarian Writers, unwelcome for the party, was one of the reasons. Union of the Soviet Writers (SSP), founded in 1932, began reforming the work process of literary circles at factories and embraced circle experience of disbanded Association of the Proletarian Writers, using its ideas for new political and ideological goals.

ID MIGRATION
AB Forced mobility and forced immobility are not just polar types of involuntary migration behavior. According to the author, they are closely interconnected and are like communicating vessels, being a product of common causes: conflict, violence, and unfavorable environmental processes, the action of which can be both stimulating and hindering movement. The decision to leave or stay is influenced by a wide range of objective factors and subjective circumstances, including values, preferences, emotions, irrationality, etc. The growing social instability and disadvantages are reflected in an increased scale of forced displacements and an increased share of refugees among migrants, which indicates an increase in the forced nature of modern migration. The proliferation of hot spots of conflicts and disasters increases the risk of falling into the traps of immobility for people who do not have resources for migration. Comprehensive solutions and joint action by states and other interested parties can help improve protection and support for those affected by political and natural disasters. There is a trend towards extending aid to broader needy groups.

AB There is general agreement that both the Security Council and State Council are significant institutions in Putin's Russia, but less clarity as to what this means, beyond that each provides opportunities for consultation with specific segments of the elite. Even this modest consensus was confounded in 2020, when both councils seemed to offer potential post-presidential roles for Putin himself, and underwent significant changes. This article describes the legal and administrative evolutions of both bodies, assesses their roles, and considers them from the perspective of a limited access order. It tackles the problem of institutions in undemocratic systems and the thin line between the decorative elements of the political system, and the bodies in which real administrative power is vested. We argue that they have a significant informal role as sites for the negotiation of power and resources and remain potential actors in the ongoing power transformation of the Russian political system.

AB This article offers a new perspective on Chinese elite politics in the Xi Jinping era by overcoming the drawbacks of the factional approach to the study of the Chinese elite. It analyses professional connections among 71 members of the category of party and state leaders of China based on information drawn from their official biographies and compiled by the authors into a single dataset. Four types of centrality - degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centralities - as well as the Louvain method for community detection, are applied to weighted and unweighted edge lists deriving from the dataset. The results reveal a positive correlation between the eigenvector centrality (unweighted) and the level of the formal political influence of a member of the Chinese elite. A distinct hierarchy of power is observed, with Politburo members and those coming from important areas, such as Shanghai, Fujian, and Zhejiang, ranking at the top. Louvain clustering (weighted) distributes members of the elite across institutional affiliation, while for the unweighted edge list it identifies both territorial and institutional, as well as mixed, clusters. The model reflects the formal political influence of the members of the elite and visualises the existence of informal groups.

AB We provide a framework for integrating sociological and political-historical approaches to the worldwide expansion of higher education in the twentieth century. Doing so enables scholars and policymakers to better identify variation across place and time in how the provision of higher education has been rendered culturally meaningful and politically feasible. We identify three conceptions of state commitment to higher education: as a national asset, a citizen right, and a commodity. The conceptions are not mutually exclusive and can simultaneously animate national cultures and politics. We also suggest a novel periodization of global higher education history from 1945 to the present. Our work serves as an introduction to the seven other articles in this special issue, which consider the twentieth-century evolution of higher education politics and policies in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and USSR/Russia.

TI Federal Institutions and Strategic Policy Responses to COVID-19 Pandemic

AB This essay examines the policy response of the federal and regional governments in federations to the COVID-19 crisis. We theorize that the COVID-19 policy response in federations is an outcome of strategic interaction among the federal and regional incumbents in the shadow of their varying accountability for health and the repercussions from the disruptive consequences of public health measures. Using the data from the COVID-19 Public Health Protective Policy Index Project, we study how the variables suggested by our theory correlate with the overall stringency of public health measures in federations as well as the contribution of the federal government to the making of these policies. Our results suggest that the public health measures taken in federations are at least as stringent as those in non-federations, and there is a cluster of federations on which a bulk of crisis policy making is carried by subnational governments. We find that the contribution of the federal government is, on average, higher in parliamentary systems; it appears to decline with the proximity of the next election in presidential republics, and to increase with the fragmentation of the legislative party system in parliamentary systems. Our analysis also suggests that when the federal government carries a significant share of responsibility for healthcare provision, it also tends to play a higher role in taking non-medical steps in response to the pandemic.

AB In the end of January 2021, the New START Treaty was extended by five years by the United States and Russia. Thus, the two nuclear superpowers have time to work on the follow-on treaty not in a strategic vacuum, but relying on the valid treaty and its system of transparency and predictability. The promoters of abolishing negotiations on arms limitation and their substitution by amorphous multilateral discussions of "a general philosophy of strategic stability", who have been highly active during recent years, have temporarily shied away, but probably not for long. The predictable difficulties of the forthcoming negotiations would be interpreted as the evidence of their impending doom, and this may turn into a self-fulfilling prophesy and once again deadlock the dialogue. During the previous decades, the development of the military technologies and new strategic concepts have changed strategic relationship of the parties. This was happening against the background of deteriorating political relations, a long pause of arms control negotiations and abrogation of a number of crucial disarmament treaties. Now the two sides have to catch up. Already it is possible to foresee the main differences of their positions. Washington is emphasizing deep reduction of the nuclear arms of the two superpowers - both strategic and tactical. Moscow has advanced a concept of "security equation", which implies limitation of offensive and defensive arms - both nuclear and nonnuclear. There will be a great demand for strong political will and wisdom of the leaders of the two nations and of hard work and professionalism of civilian and military experts - in order to restore arms control, which has historically proved its effectiveness as a barrier in preventing nuclear war and as a stabilizer of turbulent world politics.

AB Struggles against eviction are key moments in the (re)production of informal housing in Brazilian cities, as they contest the uprooting and displacement of generally low-income families. While recent research has focused on displacement due to the World Cup and Olympic Games mega-events, this paper explores struggles against eviction that are less high profile, underscoring the distributed nature of evictions in processes of urban change. Drawing on long term fieldwork, this paper examines three cases of struggles against eviction in different cities in the southeast of Brazil. This comparison highlights the everyday contestations that take place across varied geo-political terrain; the morphological constraints and opportunities for collective action of building as opposed to land occupations; the punitive and cooperative state logics with which threatened communities must engage; and drawing on recent attempts in geography to combine theorisations of territory, place, network and scale, contributes to understanding the polymorphy of spatial struggles in contemporary Brazil.

AB Are investors in electoral authoritarian regimes discriminated against for political activism? In this paper, we implement a simple experiment to test whether affiliation with the ruling party or the political opposition affects the probability that investors receive advice from investment promotion agencies in Russian regions. Between December 2016 and June 2017, we sent 1504 emails with a short question and a number of randomized treatments to 188 investment promotion agencies in 70 Russian regions. Although investment promotion agencies are nominally depoliticized in Russia, we find that switching the political affiliation of a potential investor from the opposition party ?Yabloko? to the government party ?United Russia? on average increases the chances to receive a reply by 30%. The effect strongly depends on regional levels of political competition, with higher levels of discrimination in regions that are less politically competitive.

AB Why does Russia seem simultaneously powerful and weak? This article finds the answer in a geopolitical analysis of the structural incentives for and impediments to Russian alliance policy that vary across regions in ways that elude realist, liberal and constructivist explanations of Russia's conduct. We demonstrate that those explanations miss fundamental changes in Russia's geographical position after the collapse of the USSR and the emergence of new threats and opportunities. We model the three strategic environments in which Russia acts: its immediate post-Soviet neighbourhood; more distant regions of the Eurasian continent, such as the Middle East and East Asia; and the sphere of global security issues. Building on theories of alliance behaviour, we show how the balance of threats in those strategic environments influences Russia's political and military policies in different regions in ways not captured by dominant theories or the narratives that inform policy debates.

AB The most important political protests are long-lasting campaigns where a large number of various interrelated events and actions - both for protesters and for the authorities - intersect. At the same time, empirical research tools - statistical methods and data sets - are more suitable for the study of one-off events, not related to each other in time. In this article, on the broad basis of existing research, the authors demonstrate two characteristic features of this approach - the phenomenon of "over-aggregation" and the problem of "independent events". In the first case, all parameters of protest episodes are averaged over the campaign as a whole, or over years or months. In the second case, researchers tend to form a sample of such episodes on the assumption that they are not related to each other. Both of these perspectives lead to the internal dynamics of protest campaigns being ignored, failing to take into account a number of their important features. Among such features are the nature of information asymmetry between protesters and authorities, decision-making based on information about the previous protest events (their size on the first place), the systemic effects of "cascades" and "tipping points" in the development of the protest movement, and the effects of learning. We propose agent-based mathematical model to solve these methodological problems and to depict these dynamics. In the model we present the set of potential protesters as a social network; individuals make decisions about participation in "today's" protest event on the basis of previous events. This approach considers a protest campaign as a chain of events, and enables empirically testable hypotheses to be formulated inferred not only from theory but also from the results of model experiment.

AB Characteristic features of contemporary scientific policy of Russia in the context of its instruments import are highlighted in the article. Instruments are analyzed as institutions according to the D. North interpretation. It was revealed that the main imports are the instruments those ensure the accountability of the academic community (academia). Grant funding system, scientometrics and academic excellence programs are these instruments. In the conditions of contemporary Russia the accountability of scientists and scholars to society turns into accountability to the vertical of power. The motivation of its representatives includes both the idea of public benefits as well as the task of private efficiency maximizing when to select the goals and instruments of scientific policy. It is shown that the selection process includes three main levels: political, governmental and departmental. Imported instruments are gradually transformed in accordance with the interests of the actors participating in the vertical administrative bargaining at all these levels. The goals set at the political level to strengthen economic and political positions of the country in the world are gradually being replaced with the tasks of maximizing the private efficiency of high-ranking participants in this bargaining. As a result, a qualitative modification of the sphere of science occurs. It is not just about the limitation of academic community autonomy, but about its incorporation into the vertical of power in the conditions of contemporary Russia. This fact leads to the changing of motivation and structure of academia. Academic researchers and scholars are gradually being replaced by politicized academic administrators and specific academic entrepreneurs. They are differ if compare them with the western academic entrepreneurs. The latter are focused on the competitive economic markets, while the first concentrate their attention on the redistribution of resources within the framework of vertical administrative bargaining.

ID DEMOCRACY
AB The "end of history" actually turned out to be the beginning of the end for the global hierarchy of the West, centered around societies which identified themselves as liberal market democracies. At present, one can observe a consistent weakening of Western economic, political, and military hegemony, accompanied by the rise of non-Western centers of power. The world is again moving towards conflict multipolarity, and this movement is determined by a number of background factors affecting all contemporary societies. This is the achievement of several factors: the limited capacity of global markets alongside the model of endless economic growth, the crisis of societies' class stratification, the strengthening of inequality, and the crisis of social policy focused on the labor and military usefulness of citizens. These changes allow us to formulate two interrelated theses developed in the article. The first thesis is that the globally changing economic and political ontology, which can be described as the rental turn, no longer can be convincingly described from the mainstream perspective, one of the main tasks of which was to ideologically legitimize Western hegemony. The second thesis is that the concepts of contemporary societies - running alternative to the neoliberal mainstream - that do not reveal in them the qualitative political, economic, and cultural differences lying at the foundation of the intellectual and institutional hierarchies are becoming increasingly relevant. Alternative descriptions are built primarily on the reassessment of capitalism, democracy, and market exchanges as an indispensable core of modernity, framed in the form of the liberal consensus. Under the public ideological variations of the liberal consensus, hidden mechanisms can be found, revealing themes of power-ownership, rent-seeking behavior, oligopolies, inherited power, and economic policy, far from the principles of self-regulated market competition. The neoliberal mainstream continues to classify these trends as archaic, traumatic, and unworthy deviations that need to be brought back to normal. The paradox is that liberal democracy itself ceases to be the norm, turning into a specific ideal of the political system, less and less attainable even in Western societies, where this ideal was considered to be realized in practice. The article proves the fallacy of the negative moral assessments of trends inconvenient to the mainstream. It is argued that fundamental changes, initially assessed within the narrow framework of liberal market modernity as archaic (neo-feudalism, neopatrimonialism, rent-estate society), will only increase ontologically. They will lead to the formation of a new consensus among researchers about the value-institutional economic and political normality of 21st century societies against the background of reaching the natural limits of capitalism and leveling Western hegemony. The new normality appears as a rent-estate society in an adaptive market shell, differing only in its relative thickness.

AB I am most grateful to the editors of the British Journal of Sociology for putting together such a stimulating set of review essays about my book Capital and Ideology. I am very honored by the thoughtful articles written by such a distinguished group of scholars coming from sociology, history, political science, anthropology, geography, and economics. There is no way I can do justice to the richness of each review, and it is impossible to address all the stimulating points that they raise. I would like, however, to take this opportunity to briefly clarify a limited number of issues regarding what I have tried to achieve in this book and the many limitations behind such a project.

ID HOMO POLITICUS; NATIONALISM; STATE
AB The shift to a new technological paradigm, alongside deep changes in mass perceptions and in cultural norms in societies confronting challenges to their security, is triggering radical social and political transformations. Researchers in the social sciences face a difficult dilemma: to use terms and categories that belong to a social time that is over, or to try and turn this page over to assess the ontological meanings of the transformations we are experiencing at a pace and in a space that are beyond our current vision. This latter choice would imply rethinking the meanings of development, politics of development, and political development, along with further categories used to describe social change such as nationalism, divided societies, or identity politics (to name but a few). The author proposes reconsidering development when seen as a primarily economic benchmark and instead to regard related policies as applicable to any society regardless of its economic and political standing. Political agency is considered to be the key to understanding political development and its dimensions. The state as a complex system of institutionalized social relations and political networks is at the heart of these changes: in times of crisis, the need to reevaluate its agency as a key crisis regulator becomes an important challenge both for political science and for policymakers. Trust, responsibility, and social solidarity are key values defining the feedback between society and the state: the author asserts their relevance in promoting a consistent development policy at the community level. Identity is a key resource for promoting development and for advancing these values both in elite and in mass social groups. The research draws upon a variety of sources related to the study of development politics in political research, including those produced by issue-related research groups and reproduced in survey data bases, and on the reflection of these topics in political discourse. "The New Zealand Project" is taken as an example of recourse to identity as a resource for development: the formation of a consistent development policy agenda is centered here on an inclusive national identity and on social issues important for a society sharing egalitarian visions and seeking to overcome deep social cleavages. The study of identity in a development context and the importance of value-based policy choices calls for an ethical turn in the social sciences and for a paradigm shift towards responsible development in policymaking.

AB The article is an attempt to analyze the genesis of conflicts in the Middle East, the transformation of their nature over the past two decades. While in the first years after the World War II, the chain of the main conflict situations in the region was closed on the confrontation between the Arab countries and Israel, now something different is obvious: the regional centers of power (Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia) established by the end of the second decade of the 21st century confront each other in the context of geopolitical rivalry and contradictions associated with their common religion - Islam. This was caused by two titan shifts in the political landscape of the region: the Islamic Revolution in Iran (1979), which sharply exacerbated the confrontation along the Sunnism-Shiism line, and the end of the Cold War, the disappearance of the USSR (1991) as an ideologically motivated factor that influenced the situation in The Middle East and North Africa. The disagreements between the states of the region were significantly aggravated by the events of the Arab Spring. Today, the main conflicts there are developing in the dimension of intra-Islamic confrontation - both between Sunnis and Shiites, and within the Sunni segment of this religion, which is associated with the establishment of Turkey as a third center of power promoting the Islamist concept of the Muslim Brotherhood. The transformation of the Hagia Sophia Museum in Istanbul into a mosque is becoming a symbol of Turkey's political identity as an important part of the Islamic world.

AB The development of global competition in a multilevel format on the platform of "hybrid wars" makes us assess the prospects for the evolution of such a component of them as "information wars". For a long time now, information wars have remained an integrating platform for influencing the social systems of competing countries, and the possibilities of both destructive influence and the construction of alien, hostile socio-information communities are greatly enhanced by digital integrated communications technologies. In these conditions, the fundamental task is to consider the development of information war technologies in historical continuity and taking into account not only the evolution of information society technologies, but also its socio-political content. The strategic meaning of the evolution of American approaches to information warfare in political and military-political strategy is the maximum adaptation of doctrinal decisions to current political and military-political needs. Doctrinal design has always been secondary in comparison with the current tasks and has changed relatively quickly. Political legalization of methods of active informational influence on a competitor and adversary - the main goal that it has served. In the current version of the information society, the value of information wars is also determined by the fact that, due to the high socio-constructivist potential of digital integrated communications, the technological basis of the information society, they (IoT) become the most comfortable platform for the integration of tools of various nature and technological content in hybrid wars. The operational flexibility and universalism of information wars as a genre, their ideological omnivorousness, the ability to reduce the response of the world community through the mechanisms of information wars makes them a universal tool for achieving military and political superiority.

AB The initiatives of large-scale reforms of the European Union to accelerate European integration and to achieve "European sovereignty" were one of the main topics of the presidential program of E. Macron. For the first time in the political history of the Fifth Republic, the future head of state synchronized the implementation of internal reforms in France with an ambitious "European project". The article analyzes the progress of the implementation of the European program of Macron and examines the reasons which have not allowed to achieve the implementation of the plans. The author summarizes the preliminary results of the European policy of Paris, holding that the French leader's European initiatives were unrealistic, since they did not sufficiently take into account the current complex realities and contradictions of the European Union, as well as the past negative experience of France in promoting the idea of creating a "Europe-Power". A forecast is made about a possible new version of Macron's "European project" during the presidential campaign of 2022 and the upcoming French presidency in the EU.

AB The literature considers nonviolent protests among the most important predictors of transitions towards democracy and democratic reforms. This study addresses the conditionsmaking countries more likely to experience nonviolent instead of violent forms of protest. While the literature emphasizes economic and political predictors of protest at the country level, we expand the study of nonviolent-vs-violent protest by incorporating cultural predictors. To do so, we use a newly developed time-pooled cross-sectional database covering an established set of orientations from the World Values Survey, known as "emancipative values". Estimating the prevalence of these values at the country level as a time-varying predictor of nonviolent-vs-violent protests, we present the first comprehensively longitudinal analysis of the determinants of protests. Taking into account time-varying unobserved heterogeneity, persistence, the excess number of zeros and over-dispersion in protest event data, we find that emancipative values are a significant and positive predictor of the countries' nonviolent protest levels, yet not violent protest levels.

AB The author analyzes the fundamental points which contributed to the strength of the political foundation of the Visegrad Group. Among the most significant factors, the author identifies a critical attitude towards reality, the ability to search for intra-regional/international compromises, and the lack of bureaucracy. In general, this can be described as a clear understanding of V4 position and tasks in Europe. The group's objectives in understanding their possibilities have evolved over three decades and finally have evolved from a "return to Europe" to the possibility of transferring its experience and providing assistance to the neighboring States of Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans. Without denying the contradictions that exist in the group, there are no critical prerequisites for the realization of long-standing prophecies about the imminent and unavoidable breakup of the group. Contradictions and a critical approach, as well as overcoming these circumstances, often serve as the driving force of the group. So far, despite criticism of some retired politicians, the group looks united and interested in its further common development.

AB Radical communities are a habitual part of society as a whole. For a long time, the concepts of radicals and extremists were interpreted almost as synonyms. Currently, the key conception of radicalization is that it is an expression of the process leading to extremism, and radicalization is understood as the physical, institutional, cultural violence of one social group against another. With the advent of the Internet, radical online communities have sprung up. Extremist communities are communities that have radicalized into violence. However, at present, in many countries, such communities are banned and exist illegally, camouflaged under ordinary radicals, that is, those in the process of radicalization. The aim of this research is to study the distribution of radicalization activity of the right, left, and Islamist radical online communities by region, clarifying the leading topics of radicalization within each of these areas. The initial question is the question of the hegemonic topics of radical online communities within various ideological sects in Russia. The data for the study were messages in radical groups on the social network VKontakte. The research design was based on the identification of radical content and its carriers using the snowball method and the natural language processing method. In the found groups, an automatic clustering of content was carried out in order to identify the leading topics for all types of groups. The final step was the indexing of the activity in order to determine its distribution by region. The following results were obtained. (1) Current vectors of radicalization of the right, left, and Islamist radicals were identified. At present, radicalization is taking place in the following directions: the right - the continuing practices of hatred; Islamists - the truth and purity of faith; the left - consolidation in order to ensure their own party representation in political processes. (2) Comparison of activity indices showed the insularity of activity in each sect across the country. (3) Ideological forms of radicalization prevail in comparison with the religious (Islamic) ones with the extreme right-wing opinions and sentiments in the lead. (4) Outside of traditionally Islamic regions, the generation of radical Islamic content is large in Moscow and Yugra (Western Siberia) - regions with a large number of migrants. The insularity of radicalization, its thematic heterogeneity, and a strict ban on hate speech suggest a splitting of the conventional model of "radicalization toward extremism" into many independent streams with different, including non-violent and constructive, outcomes pertaining to radicalization " into" civic activism, single-issue radicalism focused on climate, animal rights, body policies, immunization ("antivaxxers"), the use of nuclear energy ("antinukers"), green activism, etc. A comprehensive study of these trends can form the basis for further understanding of the process of radicalization in the new turbulent world.

AB As evidenced by WTO theory and practice, even as exceptions regulated at Article XXIV GATT 1994 and Article V GATS, regional trade agreements (RTAs) or preferential trade agreements are an important legal tool to liberalize trade and strengthen economic or political cooperation. In recent years, notwithstanding the fiasco of TTIP and TPP, RTAs have proliferated in different regions of the world. Among them, the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) is a customs union established in 2015 which is institutionally similar to the European Union (EU) albeit unexplored in academic literature. Remarkably, during its first five years of existence as an international organization, the EAEU has become a trade entity capable of adopting common technical regulations and a uniform customs code regulating cross-border trade in the internal single market and with third parties. Moreover, the EAEU has been quite active in concluding international agreements with third States, setting the basis to make the EAEU a key player on the global arena. Is the EAEU an RTA with the purpose to liberalize trade and services, mindful of the WTO philosophy, or rather is it a mean to attract back in the Moscow's orbit some of the Post-Soviet States thus reaching precise geopolitical ends? What is its relevance for international business?

TI TRUST AS AN IRRATIONAL COMPONENT OF RATIONALITY: ROLE IN THE
   CONSTRUCTION OF PERSONAL IDENTITY

DE trust; trust-based rational type of scientific rationality; emotional
   intellect; understanding; hermeneutics
AB The problem of substantiating trust as a component of modern scientific rationality is caused by the need to search for regulatory mechanisms, which are relevant to the specifics of modern social development. Scientific rationality, which was constructed within the limits of Kant's "pure mind", requires adaptation to new conditions. "Rhizome", "risk", "nomadism", " fluidity" and other similar characteristics of the modern society, first of all, have a negative resonance for cultural and personal identities and cause their crisis. The article raises the question of searching for mechanisms of social development that would be able to see not only rationally verified social practices, but also irrational moments of social dynamics. The article proposes to consider trust as one of such mechanisms. The category "trust-based rational type of scientific rationality" is introduced. To explore the role of trust in maintaining personal identity is a current interest. The modern deconstructivist processes in philosophy initiate a rethinking of the style of mind that provoked the past (classical) socio-ontological constructions through scientific instrumental rationality. The constructions were aimed at a stationary social space, were created according to strict logic, and captured the universal, absolute, rationally verified and reduced schemes of life. The metaphysics of such an ontology was set by the imperious arche-limit that conditioned the identification of social artifacts and the identification of the person as well. Today, this view is concretized by sociocultural processes and is actualized in the categories "crisis", "chaos", "risk", "fluidity", " rhizome", etc. The ontological instability of the modern world raises the question: Is it possible to trust the world if it is in constant motion and change? The problem of trust is raised, despite the fact that trust is not manifested in a rational way. Trust is a key characteristic of personal identity since it allows a person to live in an unstable and constantly changing world. Trust complements the rational mind with a sensory component, which allows rational thoughts to be empathetic to the world and to understand it. The authors of this article refer to the recognized world authorities P. Ricoeur and J. Habermas to validate this idea. These philosophers write about the complementarity of the rational and sensual levels of attitude to the world, and about attention to the rational and irrational structures of consciousness (understanding, intuition, trust, etc.). However, is it correct to conclude that a rational style of mind admits irrational constructions and motives? It is necessary to argue the complementarity of rational-logical and irrational-understanding structures of mind. The category "emotional intelligence" is emerging in modern philosophical literature. Rational and irrational structures of mind are the referent of this category. Trust is an irrational structure and it complements the universal constructions of mind through the ability of understanding. Mind, which complementarily includes the structures of trust and understanding, is a new type of rationality. It is "trust-based rational type of scientific rationality" or " understanding rationality". The final part of the article discusses education, which is directly related to the formation of personal identity. Modern education does not pay attention to the formation of trust as the key structure of the worldview.
   On the contrary, education pays great attention to the formation of such personal competencies as entrepreneurship and the ability to commerce. All this requires careful consideration and humanitarian expert examination.

AB The article investigates the role of new digital technologies during a crisis period on the example of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the methods used by different states to prevent the spread of the virus and its consequences, the author analyzes the advantages of the impelled rapid digitalization, scrutinizes its negative aspects, and discusses perspectives. Although the digital transformation had already been taking place before the pandemic actually started (2019), the current crisis facilitates the unprecedented digitalization breakthrough in all life spheres, which will have delayed consequences. The short-run effects are already obvious: deepening of virtual communication; advancement of electronic document flow systems and online-services (including E-Government, public health service, etc.); virtualization of education, culture, sports, leisure activities; transformation of labour market towards distance employment, an outburst of electronic commerce and services, robot automation in economy; virtualization of political life (online-meetings, online-debates, online-summits, etc.), and, moreover, a transfer of power struggle and geopolitical struggle itself to digital platforms. Greater convenience and effectiveness are the most vivid advantages of digital technologies development, which plays the key role in crisis periods. Better access of disabled persons and people living in geographically remote places to medical aid, education, cultural objects, etc. also belongs to important achievements of the rapid digitalization. At the same time, there are significant negative aspects of this process, both general and specific. The violation of democratic rights and freedoms (primarily, of personal data security and individual privacy) is unavoidable in the light of the necessary "digital control" from the state to contain the spread of infection. Private IT companies participating in the process of the virus spread control due to their products (mobile applications, Internet platforms, etc.) also benefit from access to personal data. Whereas this issue is not central in authoritarian regimes like China, it becomes very challenging for democratic societies of the West. The digitalization of services gives wide room for irregularities and fraud in general. A growing "digital exclusion" is another concern: the greater dependency on technical means excludes certain parts of the population unable to use them for different reasons. An increasing individualization and solitude amid the lacking real-life communication gives rise to complicated psychological issues and mental disorders. Among specific negative side-effects of digitalization there are obstacles in personal electronic verification, worsening in the quality of remote medical assistance and online-education, unemployment growth and smashup of offline-businesses in economy, and some other. The most complicated question of the current crisis and the next "post-COVID" period is how serious the above-mentioned negative consequences of the rapid digitalization will be, to what extent they may devaluate its advantages, what sacrifice will be made by humanity to pay for comfort and effectiveness.

AB The article examines the processes of formation and institutionalization of pan-European parties (Europarties) as a new institution in the party-political system of the European Union. This institution emerged relatively recently in the mid-1970s, on the eve of the first European elections in 1979. The main stages of institutionalization of European parties and their factions in the European Parliament are presented. The article shows the key differences between this type of a party and traditional political parties as well as the way relations between the European parties and national parties from the EU member states are developing. It analyzes the current state of these parties and the impact of the most important challenges that the European Union has faced in the last decade: the global financial and economic crisis, the migration crisis in Europe, Brexit, and the coronavirus pandemic. The article considers the legal basis for ensuring the functioning of these parties, which is contained in the Lisbon Treaty, and a number of other fundamental acts of the European Union regulating the activities of its political system. The results of the 2014 and 2019 panEuropean parliamentary elections are analyzed; it is shown how positions of the leading European parties represented in the European Parliament have changed. The reasons for the change in the electoral results of these parties, including the growing popularity of Eurosceptic parties, are indicated. It is noted to which EU member states the most popular European parties belong, and what the reason for this distribution is. The article presents new trends in the development of the Institute of European parties associated with an active use of new communication technologies in party building, as well as the emergence of a new type of European parties that advocate the federalization of the European Union.

AB Scientists from both sides of the Iron Curtain met in Geneva in 1958 and 1959 to create the technical basis for monitoring a future nuclear test ban treaty. Despite their scientific veneer, these meetings were politically motivated and the scientists tried to forward U.S. or Soviet objectives through their technical discussions. Seismographic data was a cornerstone of the proposed monitoring regime, but when the discussions became political, so too did the instruments that produced the scientific data. Thus, seismographs became diplomatic objects used to support or challenge foreign policy objectives. After the collapse of the scientific meetings, the US distributed seismographs as diplomatic gifts to create a worldwide, U.S.-controlled nuclear-detection network in 1960. To exploit data from the network without supporting U.S. policy objectives, the USSR in 1961 proposed to exchange U.S. seismographs for Soviet ones, as two objects of equal value. That allowed each superpower to access the other's technology without creating bonds of mutual obligations. However, this type of inverted, object-based diplomacy also gave scientists from international scientific organisations or small, non-nuclear nations like Denmark a way to engage in nuclear diplomacy. When Danish scientists offered to create a connection station between the U.S. and Soviet seismic networks, they did so in full agreement with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to strengthen their policy of nuclear disarmament independently of U.S. objectives.

AB Due to the successful centralization efforts of the beginning of the 2000s, Russian governors almost lost their domestic as well as international agency. However, there is still a considerable variation in their international activity levels that remains unexplained. Employing an original dataset on the international activity of Russian governors from 2005 to 2015, the article investigates what effect regional political regime, ethnicity and other factors have on the level of gubernatorial participation in paradiplomacy. The level of regional democracy, the absence of ties between governors and regional elites, and the ethnic distinctiveness of a region are all positively associated with the engagement in international activity. The article demonstrates that regional authorities turn to paradiplomacy when faced with pressures for resource attraction and ethnic identity construction, even under the conditions of a relatively centralized authoritarian state.

DE smart; smart technology; criteria; concept; phenomenon
AB Smart technologies are explored as a phenomenon and concept. The focus on the subject is due to the wide spread of smart technologies, their ubiquitous use in everyday life, and the insufficient level of their reflection both as a phenomenon and as a concept. This contradiction does not always contribute to the efficient use of smart technologies. Smart technologies as a concept are largely determined by the specifics of their phenomenal functioning, which complicates the possibility of its clear definition. Therefore, in foreign and domestic studies, it is impossible to find a universal way of determining smart technologies due to the contextual factors in the form of social, cultural, value differences between different societies and countries. On the example of comparing connotations of the concept "smart technology" in English- and Russian-language studies, the differences in semantic nuances is demonstrated. The inaccuracy of translating "smart technologies" as "umnye tekhnologii" ("umnye" is a derivative of "um" [mind]) is justified, since this connotation is not unambiguously recognized either by foreign or domestic authors. More precisely, the concept "um" is not of the utmost importance in the concept under consideration in foreign literature. The Russian-speaking tradition of understanding the word "um" ("umnye") also has certain specifics. In the domestic tradition, an understanding of "um/mind" as a "staircase wit" has developed, which significantly prevents the formation of value-based, cultural and social ontological foundations for the creation and effective use of smart technologies. This dependence of the definition of smart technologies on the practice of applying this phenomenon is also evident in other societies and countries. Criteria for distinguishing smart technologies from technologies of a traditional type are revealed: technological and generational. The characteristics associated with technological criteria are universal in nature, but their values are nevertheless determined by the values and cultural features of countries where smart technologies are exploited. The same applies to the generational foundation, which manifests itself all over the world regardless of culture and country and is due to the birth of generation Z. At the same time, the universalism of the generational plan does not negate the cultural values of this or that society, under the influence of which this factor is further leveled.

DT Article
DE USA; Germany; Bundeswehr; US forces; security; occupation
AB The article discusses the dynamics of the US military presence in Germany through the evolution of American foreign policy. The article presents data on the quantitative presence of the American army in Germany and assesses the impact of various incentives to change the size of the American contingent and their comparison. The presence of the US armed forces in Germany is one of the most striking examples of the long-term deployment of foreign troops on the territory of a major power. In terms of the duration and size of the contingent, it is comparable only to the deployment of American troops in Japan. In both countries, foreign troops played an occupying role after the end of World War II. In the future, the American contingent remained in them already as an ally. At the same time, in the case of Germany, the presence of foreign military personnel was combined with the creation of an efficient and relatively large army. For a long time, Tokyo was limited only by compact self-defense forces. The presence of independent capabilities to ensure security is often a prerequisite for pursuing an independent policy and encourages the refusal to deploy a contingent of another state on its territory. It is all the more surprising that in the FRG the question of the withdrawal of US forces was never seriously raised. On the contrary, the German leadership has repeatedly expressed concern about the possibility of reducing the American presence. In this it was very different from the Japanese establishment, in which the expediency of maintaining allied relations with the United States was sometimes critically assessed. The authors conclude that ensuring the loyalty of the German leadership was not associated with the size of Washington's military presence on the territory of Germany. The buildup of the American contingent in the Federal Republic of Germany was influenced by fears around external threats, the correlation of conventional and nuclear deterrence in the US strategy and the desire to reduce military costs.

TI Russia's cooperation with Asian observers to the Arctic Council

DE Arctic; russia; Asian countries; the Northern Sea Route; lng; china;

AB Despite being regarded as non-Arctic states, a number of Asian countries have been developing their Arctic policies and activities since mid-1990s. Being interested in securing its national interests and unique status of an Arctic great power, Russia till roughly 2013 had opposed non-Arctic countries' engagement in Arctic issues. However, since 2013, Russia has been changing its approach with regard to participation of non-Arctic states in Arctic activities, considering them as partners. This article analyzes commercial cooperation between Russia and five Asian observers to the Arctic Council in the development of Arctic natural resources and the Northern Sea Route in the years of 2013-2020. It demonstrates how Moscow finds the balance between the need to protect its national interests in the Arctic and the necessity to cooperate with Asian countries as capable of providing Russia with financial capital and advanced technologies indispensible for further Arctic development. The author characterises Russia's current approach towards Arctic cooperation with Asian partners as cautious pragmatism - a desire to develop beneficial partnerships with non-Arctic states within certain limits in a controllable scope. The conclusions would certainly suggest that currently, despite official rhetoric and numerous publicised plans for cooperation in the Arctic, Russia's actual commercial engagement with Asian states is still modest. So far, the most dynamic and successful cooperation was that relating to the Arctic LNG projects. Russia and its Asian counterparts have found that moving beyond political declarations might be quite difficult. The article also concludes that while all five Asian countries search for business opportunities as contractors for Russia's Arctic projects, only few of them - China and Japan - are ready to provide investment or financing.

AB This article aims to identify the main components of the EU approach to countering hybrid threats. To achieve this goal, research questions were posed: 1) How does the theory of hybrid warfare define hybrid threats, what are its strengths and weaknesses? 2) How is the approach to combating hybrid threats regulated in the EU? 3) What changes are taking place in this approach under the influence of trends in recent years, including the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic? The author concludes that the "open architecture" of the hybrid war theory, the wide possibilities of interpreting the definition of hybrid threats allow us to improve practical measures and theoretical approaches to security problems. However, as economic competition and political contradictions under geopolitical rivalry deepen, the approach to countering hybrid threats is hyper politicized, being used to justify sanctions pressure, strengthening military blocs or massive psychological campaigns against a political adversary. The EU tries to develop and improve a systemic approach to ensuring security in the context of the growth of hybrid threats. However, this approach is increasingly deformed under the influence of above-mentioned hyperpoliticization. This is especially evident in the EU' s attitude towards Russia and China, which are constantly accused of creating hybrid threats. The excessive use of the rhetoric of the hybrid war theory in the EU discourse jeopardizes the security of Europe.

DE Khabarovsk; private sector; social space; local community; solidarity;

AB The article examines the forms of routine resistance of the community that was established within the space of the Soviet private sector in the cities located in the eastern part of Russia. Despite active regular construction, these spaces still make up a significant part of cities. However, in contrast to the Soviet period, when living there was perceived as forced and temporary, today this form of residence is a conscious choice. The former private sector witnesses the emergence of the community, whose existence is based on values, social and communicative practices, and forms of economic activity that are noticeably different from the official ones. This community "produces space" that is appropriate to its lifestyle. For the official authorities (at the state and city levels), this space turns out to be "empty", representing "promising areas of development". Its population remains invisible to these authorities. This creates a latent conflict that gives rise to the forms of resistance described in the article. With all the variety of such forms, there is one main thing that unites them - people's desire to distance from the state and the city it regulates.
   The authors find out that another group of city dwellers with a much higher socio-economic status - residents of urban mansion districts - share the same aspiration. According to the authors, this desire can be explained by the fact that a resident of a Russian city has few opportunities to find solidarity community within the existing urban structures and therefore builds his/her life "outside the city wall", creating analogs of the pre-modern European municipalities. The remaining "urban" part of the city is increasingly turning into a feudal lord's castle that from time to time sends troops to punish the "rebels".
   As long as a feudal lord has an understanding that he really needs townspeople, and they have the opportunity to "escape" from the raid, the situation seems stable. When the raids become too frequent, and it is impossible to escape from them, the population will attack. At the moment, judging by the attitude of the group studied in the article to the rallies in defense of S.Furgal, ex-governor of Khabarovsk region, the authorities still have room for maneuver. However, for how long this situation will last remains to be seen.

AB The article analyzes the key factors in the formation and further development of environmental protest movements in modern Russia (on the example of protests in the Republic of Tatarstan and Kirov Oblast in 2017-2019). Quantitative and qualitative methods of interpreting textual data sources were used as research tools. The list of publications was compiled using the Medialogia information and analytical system. The time frame was the period from 2019 to 2020. Earlier publications were found using links to previously published materials on the topic and manually. This made it possible to cover materials for 2017-2020 and to get a broader picture of the environmental protests taking place in the two regions. Content analysis, intent analysis, undirected event analysis were chosen as research methods. During the undirected event analysis of the text of the publications, the date, place and organizers of the protest, the number of participants, the matter of legal concordance of the protest with the authorities, the demands of the participants to the regional authorities, as well as other informational themes related to the activities of the protesters were recorded. To analyze the demands of the activists, thematic content analysis was used as a secondary method. As a result of the study, the authors come to the conclusion that regional protest movements are a significant component of the political process in modern Russia. Regional protest movements have two clear "beneficiaries": the protesters themselves and employees of regional administrations interested in understanding the factors of formation and development of protest movements. A belated and inadequate reaction to the emerging protest movement on the part of the regional authorities not only threatens their legitimacy in the eyes of the region's population, but also, under certain circumstances, may become a reason for raising the question of their ability to control the situation by the federal authorities. An analysis of the activity of protesters against the construction of waste processing complexes in the villages of Osinovo (Republic of Tatarstan) and Mirny (Kirov Oblast) made it possible to formulate the key factors in the formation and development of regional environmental protest movements.

AB Only a small portion of the work written by Fedor Karpov, a diplomat and publicist who worked under the Grand Prince Vasili III, has been preserved. A detailed assessment of his literary activity is additionally complicated by the fact that Karpov's writings were mainly extracted from the so-called formulaire collection. There, the researcher has to rely primarily on the literary context in order to get an idea of the aesthetic, ideological and political position of the writer, whose works were included into the formulaire collection. As far as Karpov is concerned, he was related primarily with the scribes from the Joseph-Volokolamsk monastery. The author of the article tries to demonstrate the significance of the Chudov monastery in the activity of the writer and diplomat, especially in the fate of Karpov's works. It is shown in the article that the replicas of the works by Fedor Karpov in the book writing activity of the Kremlin monastery can be traced throughout the 16th century: up until 1525 Karpov was in regular correspondence with Maxim the Greek who lived in Chudov, his Panegyric to Vasili III was reflected in The Book of Degrees, which has been compiled many times and edited in the same monastery.

ID PRINCIPLES
AB Inequality has again become one of the most urgent and difficult problems in modern societies. Economic inequality, and inequality in other social dimensions, has shown a tendency to grow in developed and developing countries. In the social sciences, studies of inequality have a long history. In many explanatory schemata, priority is given to social and political institutions. Whereas in the mid 20th century institutions were routinely qualified as objective, naturally evolving systems of norms, serving to ensure the cohesion of social practices, further studies referring to complex societies emphasized that institutions are a product of the relationship between the power elite and civil society. When civil society and its organizations grow weaker and when society loses its "subjectivity", the power elites strengthen their hold and manipulate norms to their benefit. The achieved consensus of conformity breaks down as soon as society ceases to be industrial and loses the dominance of routines and bureaucracy in social life. In increasingly complex societies, public demand for egalitarian policy is growing, presuming not only equality in legislation, but also social equality embodied in the idea of a developed welfare state.

AB The article is a presentation of the research program for the study of political processes in the greater Mediterranean region; the scientific and practical reasons for actualizubg the problems of political development within the macroregion are demonstrated. Special attention is paid to political evolution in the region, including its transformations and transitions, which have recently put it at the top of the global political agenda. A review of the study of the Mediterranean in the history of socio-political thought and in modern political science is provided. It is proposed that the Greater Mediterranean should be conceptualized as 1) modern States of the Mediterranean, Black, and Azov seas; 2) regions including these States; 3) regions described by the contours of empires and civilizations which had access to the Mediterranean and influenced its development; 4) the middle regions, functionally similar to the Mediterranean; and 5) the scope of multilateral global communications, including the Mediterranean or being correlated with it. This design determines the direction of comparative studies: 1) the manifestation of Mediterranean trends in individual countries and subregions of the "basin"; 2) a comparison of the political dynamics of the Mediterranean with other regions; 3) a comparison of mediterraneans; 4) a correlation of trends in the political development of the Mediterranean and mediterraneans with global trends. Thus, the Great Mediterranean is presented in the article as a subject of political research across a the long historical timeline and in the macroregional spatial "unfolding". It is interpreted as a macroregion - an ecosystem in which, due to its resource and civilizational attractiveness, geopolitical strategies compete and evolve most intensively. This conceptualization helps to reveal a cluster of interrelated problems of political development within the region (transits, migrations, hybrid conflicts, secessions, fragility of states, international legal dysfunctions), and to form a relevant framework for their study.

AB In the last decade, the coverage of social networks on the Internet by radical groups has expanded and provided militant extremists with many opportunities to recruit new adherents, build chains of interactions, and distribute illegal content. Extremist organizations engage in targeting, recruiting new members on social sites such as Facebook, VKontakte, and on radicalized web forums, including within individual communities. The main danger of online radicalization lies in its ability to quickly "infect" large online communities with destructive content. On the other hand, the Internet facilitates the study of extremist views. The use of automated or semi-automatic data collection tools based on the analysis of the website text content where extreme opinions are potentially distributed allows identifying incident planning quickly. As part of the study, we formulate an assumption on the effectiveness of using existing parsing services to automate the detection of cross-links between ultraright community users. In this article, we consider only information that is freely available on the Internet. As an experimental site, we chose the social network VKontakte. To solve the problem, we analyzed the involvement of the community in radical far- right groups, as well as cross-links between them and student communities selected as experimental. Two student communities SC 1 and SC 2 were selected with the number of subscribers 22,000 and 1,600, respectively. The expert selected 30 radical ultra-right communities. According to the proposed algorithm, we found users who are members of a radical far-right community, as well as users who are simultaneously members of several radical far-right communities. The study showed that automated detection of cross-links between users of radical far-right communities in a social network is an achievable goal. However, various parsing services for similar requests provide results different from each other. Thus, the challenge remains to develop software tools for automating sociological research based on data retrieved from social networks.

AB This paper aimed to investigate the FDI determinants in 27 transition countries within the 2002 - 2018 period by employing system GMM analysis. One of the results of our research is that an uncertain political situation and civil liberties violations have a significant negative impact on foreign investors' confidence. Generally, the erosion of democratic institutions acts as a deterrent to FDI inflows. Transition countries which experienced prolonged periods of central planning also recorded lower levels of FDI inflows. The results show that creating conditions for stimulating foreign investors through the improvement of institutional quality embodied in the control of corruption and voice and accountability impacted positively on FDI inflows. The interplays between overall institutional quality, voice and accountability, regulatory quality, government effectiveness and GDP growth are positive and significant. Hence, macroeconomic development has an important impact on the marginal effect of institutional quality. Therefore, we concluded that the influence of governance on FDI inflows is conditional on the transition countries' macroeconomic performance. Our findings also reveal that of the governance dimensions, control of corruption and voice and accountability have a significant influence on the decision of multinationals to undertake investment.

AB For many decades, Northern Ireland has been characterized by a tense conflict of identities with frequent outbreaks of political and religious violence. At the end of the 20th century, a consensus was reached between the opposing sides on the need for a peaceful settlement of the contradictions, which was reflected in the 1998 Belfast Agreement. The most important part of the agreement was a transition to the consociational model of governance. Consociationalism was assumed to "cure" the Northern Irish region, save it from violence and antagonism, and help to establish a dialogue between the representatives of the region's key collective identities - unionists and nationalists. However, although 22 years have passed since the introduction of the consociational system, the settlement of the conflict has not seen any obvious progress.
   The article attempts to trace the reasons for this state of affairs and, in particular, to find out whether consociational model could, in principle, live up to the expectations. Based on the analysis of the fundamental characteristics of this model, as well as the institutional patterns in the Northern Irish politics, P.Maksimova comes to the conclusion that consociational practices not only failed to contribute to the elimination of the antagonistic moods in the society, but also helped to preserve them. According to the author, consociational system is merely an instrument of crisis management, which, if misinterpreted, can only intensify confrontation and block the final settlement of the conflict. This is exactly what happened in Northern Ireland, where the specific features of the consociational system made it almost impossible to abandon group identities.

AB The paper focuses on analyzing the effects of political human capital management as a system of strategic decisions increasing the modern state's competitiveness under the digital economy conditions. The paper aims to identify efficient public management patterns of the development of national human capital in the Russian institutional environment. A circle of matters is problematized with analyzing specifics of quality reproduction, accumulation, and efficient use of human capital, specifics of control over these processes in the age of digitization. Relevant academic discussion of the phenomenon of human capital is analyzed. Its interpretation is a critical asset of strategic changes and the increasing competitiveness of the modem state. The authors use classic theories of human capital and original methodological policies. The research concludes that under the current conditions of fast-moving innovative processes, a demand not as much for hard skills as for soft and digital skills, the state must strive to a comprehensive and strategic approach to the management of people's competences, which implies above all investments in the institutes which facilitate accumulation and updating of human capital. It is asserted that ensuring such a strategic and comprehensive approach requires transforming a system of taking political decisions, reforming the educational infrastructure, personnel development and education, and forming civil readiness to use the benefits of digitization. The paper's special focus is on giving recommendations to public authorities to increase the competitiveness of the modern state in the digital economy age. (C) 2021 Published by European Publisher.

ID DEMOCRACY
AB After the collapse of the bipolar world, the neoliberal mainstream emerged in the global hierarchy of social sciences, built on three axiomatic pillars: Western domination, capitalism (free market) and liberalism (the value of individual autonomy). Nowadays, one can more and more often witness criticism and disintegration of the mainstream, which claimed the universality of descriptions and legitimation of modern societies that have reached the end of history in the form of open-access liberal market democracies. The purpose of the article is to find out how transformations of the prevailing political and economic orders, configurations of the subjects of geopolitical dominance and their legitimate metaphors determine the direction of changes in the social sciences mainstream. The hypothesis of the research is that the prevailing principles of stratification and distribution of public resources will be less and less valuable and institutionally related to capitalism, market and democracy, since an appeal to the latter does not lead to an increase in the available opportunities for the majority of the population in practice. The global change in social ontology, the structure of economic reproduction and legitimate foundations of the political order bring about a drop in the credibility and relevance of mainstream concepts focused on the axiomatics of market values and liberal rhetoric. Intellectual attempts to restore the relevance of the neoliberal mainstream through the construction of local utopias (flat world, creative class, knowledge economy, etc.), the introduction of complementary concepts of civil repair (J. Alexander), sociocultural trauma (P. Shtompka), unworthy government (bad governance), dependence on previous development (path dependence) or gauge (N. Rozov) do not save from growing conceptual stretch. Formation of a society without tangible economic growth and a declining need for mass labor leads to the inevitable transformation of the mainstream. Alternative and peripheral theories that describe the contours of a global future mainly in non-market, non-capitalist and, possibly, non-liberal categories are becoming more influential. These are concepts that fix new formats for the distribution of public resources, less and less connected with the market, democracy and hegemony of the West, but increasingly - with rental mechanisms, distributive political regulation and differentiated value of different social groups for the national state.

AB The article presents an analysis of the colonial exhibition of 1931 in the context of the metamorphosis of the colonial idea in France. After the First World War, the difficulties in managing the colonies were increasingly felt in France. The French political class hoped to give new vitality to the national consciousness, which was threatened by various social-revolutionary and anti-colonial movements, through the reform of colonial policy. The colonial exhibition of 1931 became the apogee of imperial propaganda in the metropolis and a symbol of unity between the Third Republic with its colonies. Its success was associated with the extent to which the colonial idea penetrated French society and with the stabilization of the mother country's relations with her colonies between the two world wars. The colonial discourse of the 1931 exhibition was an apology for republican centrism expressed through the firm positioning of racial superiority, the demonstration of the validity of the ideals of progress inevitably brought about by colonization, and the dominance of French values. The author demonstrates that the new political situation that developed after the Great War contributed to the achievement of colonial consolidation, on the part of the majority of parties and, mainly, through the deployment of the state propaganda machine. The colonies and the colonial question marked the outlines, the brushstrokes, as it were, of a national union. This union between the national and the colonial, the nation and the empire, was twofold. Between the two world wars, national and colonial issues became logically interlinked and interdependent. The author concludes that the 1931 exhibition propagated the idea of the imperial order through the display and presentation of idealized indigenous cultures represented by a variety of artifacts, fine arts, and architecture. The 1931 exhibition became a general imperial holiday, and was intended to serve the unity between the imperial centre and the colonies. It became an important tool of imperial construction, a fairly effective means of broadcasting the official imperial ideology, and a metaphor for the colonial republic, which embodied the cultural, social, and mental characteristics of the imperial nation; its hidden meaning was directed against the growing ideas of colonial nationalism and resistance.

   strategy; enterprise; complexity; management; personality; intangible

AB The article is devoted several aspects emerging in the current transit of civilization - the genesis, the problems, and the prospects regarding the development of trans-border innovative enterprises (anthropo-social structures - ASS). Attention is drawn to their growth in number, multiplication, diversity, high adaptability, other specific qualities, and competitive advantages. Civilization is a dynamic concept, a social analogue of evolution, and these ambitious enterprises are subjects of historical competition. Globalization, which expands space for operations and range of communications, is accompanied by the individuation of a significant number of ambitious persons (manterprisers) vs. mass society and inclusive atomization. Crises of modern political structures and the spread of social, technical, and anthropological complexities, as well as the creation of innovative virtual "cloud structures" etc, disrupt the existing balance of power and distort the modern world order. Forecast technics, based on a transdisciplinary approach, global dimensions, and a long-term perspective, are elaborated to predict the future, yet they are not very effective. Methodology for complex systems/operations analysis replaces long-term calculations with nonlinear dynamics, global generalizations with fractality evaluations, and disciplinary approach with attention to breakthrough situations. Deep education is a fusion of core motivation (mission) with the purposes of action (vision), knowledge with exploration, and personal growth. Socially motivated enterprises form ASS-ensembles, which tend to generate a universal Postmodern infrastructure upon the pillars of Modernity. The article also presents typology of social evolution strategies and provides historical examples of their implementation, which vary significantly, depending on the intentions of the main actor of a strategy. New forms of conflict and political alliances emerge. The fight for the future is an asymmetrical co-evolution of entities with interests that are not quite matching yet not quite opposites. In times of crises, competition escalates: someone wins, someone loses, someone goes to the dustbin of history. The search for evolutionary strategy, methods of cognition and technologies of action effective in the hybrid environment of civilizational transit, is on the agenda.

AB This study examines the effect of specific factors (including user features, such as propensity for conspiracy thinking, and news item features, such as news frame and news source) on the accuracy of social media users in fake news recognition. Being a part of a larger research on fake news perception, this study uses the data from an online experiment that asks social media users from three countries (Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan) to evaluate a set of news items constructed with specific conditions. Namely, the users receive true and fake news about the neighboring countries framed differently and ascribed to either domestic or foreign sources. We then assess users' accuracy in detecting fake news. The results of the study confirm the important role of conspiracy thinking style in false news recognition (leading to a decrease in accuracy) and users' capability for deliberation on social media more broadly. However, the influence of contextual factors is mixed. While news sources exhibit no influence on the accuracy of fake or true news detection, dominant framing tends to increase the accuracy of true news only. More predictors of news recognition accuracy are discussed in the paper. As a result, this research contributes to the theory of fake news susceptibility by revealing a rich set of individual factors and interaction effects that influence human judgment about news truthfulness and impact deliberation possibilities in socially mediated environments.

DE activity; agency; digital governance; fluid technology; digital platform
AB Researchers regard digital technologies both as conditions to engage active citizens in urban governance and as power devices that deprive most participants from their activity in social interactions. Discussing such problematic activity, we formulate the following research questions: how does digital technology work as means for citizen engagement in governance? How does citizen activity become an element that presupposes a constructive transformation of technologies? The article presents the empirical study of citizens' participation in urban governance within voting and discussing the "Program for the renovation of the housing stock in Moscow" that involved the usage of the "Active citizen" digital platform. We regard this platform as a part of the digital technology of city governance. The conceptual basis for the research refers to the Science and Technology Studies: we elaborate on the concepts of agency and activity to determine the nature of participation in the governance; and fluidity to describe a technology with a distributed subject that demonstrates flexibility and the ability to transform while maintaining its unity. The article proposes and substantiates the hypothesis that the technology that fits the purposes of involving active citizens in urban governance should demonstrate fluidity at two levels. In contrast to the first, the second level is related to technology's ability to take into account both agency and activity of actors articulated in their critical attitudes to digital technology. The "Active Citizen" platform's case study reveals the conditions and challenges of technology transformation to the second fluidity level.

DE social institution; social practices; habitualization;

AB The article presents findings of a sociological research on the process of formation of social practices of citizens' participation in the development of the urban environment. Creating a new, peoplefriendly urban space involves taking into account the interests of various population groups and working out the mechanisms for citizens' involvement in urban management. The purpose of the work is to identify main ways for engaging citizens in the development of the urban environment by analyzing the processes of institutionalization. The theoretical and methodological basis of the research includes works devoted to social institutions and institutionalization, social movements as institutionalization agents, the right of citizens to participate in urban development, and the issues of civic participation in designing urban spaces. The analysis has identified main participants (actors) whose interests are affected when the issue concerning the development of the urban environment is formulated and addressed. We consider two processes of formation of the rules according to which the actors perform their functions in public arenas: from below through habitualization or from above as an import of social institutions. We show the differences in the process and results of institutionalization of civic engagement in the presence or absence of a conflict of interests among the main actors: society, government, business community. We compare the processes according to the following parameters: the nature of institutional changes, relations and actions, type of institutional changes, structure of political opportunities, and civic engagement levels. We draw conclusions about how the orientation of the processes affects the nature of civic participation. In particular, the loss of the "partnership" and "delegation of authority" stages in the process of institutionalization from above indicates a formal and imitative nature of the practices of civic participation in urban development. The novelty of the work consists in comparing the oppositely directed processes of institutionalization of civic participation (from below and from above) on the example of a specific sphere such as urban development.

AB The article analyzes the public and private life world of the precariat, a new emerging (proto)class, which currently includes about half of the economically active population in Russia. The life world of the precariat, its social position as the largest social community in Russian society is examined and compared with data for the entire economically active population, as well as with other communities and groups. An answer is given to the question of what is the attitude of the precarians to the ongoing macro-economic, macro-social and macro-political problems when a person acts as a citizen of the country. The social position of the employee as a resident of the administrative territory and his/her concerns at this level of social organization of society are also analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the characterization of the socio-economic position of precarians as workers within the framework of the problems that concern them in labor organizations. Finally, it analyzes the private life of people as participants in interpersonal relationships and contacts. This approach allows us to more fully characterize the life world of the precariat, to identify its landmarks, including taking into account the specifics of employment in various sectors (spheres) of the economy. The main features and prospects of public and private life of precarians, costs and deformation processes influencing the normalization of their life world are characterized.

AB The article considers the features of the Russians' media consumption and their attitudes to political institutions (federal and regional). The survey of the population of the Republic of Mordovia aimed at finding correlations between the use of certain information channels, the level of trust in them, and the approval of the authorities. The study showed that the choice of traditional media (television, newspapers, magazines, radio) or new media (social networks, Internet websites, telegram channels) divides people into groups according to their political preferences. Traditional media (conditionally the "TV" party) tend to unite representatives of older cohorts living in rural areas and supporting the government. New media (conditionally the "Internet" party) tend to attract mainly young people living in cities, having a relatively high level of education and being critical of political institutions. The author believes that there is a potential for reconciliation of these two 'parties' - in the communicative possibilities of personal connections (friends, relatives, acquaintances), because the close social circle seems to provide grounds for discussing the current situation in the country and the region. The results of the survey show a high level of distrust to all information channels and a low level of approval of the authorities. The situation is aggravated by the coronavirus crisis: skepticism about official information determined a significant number of rumors discrediting political institutions, which in the future may negatively affect election campaigns at all levels.

AB The article analyses the complex influence of dangerous changes, which took place after 2014 in the international political environment in Europe, on the ongoing transformations, suggests essential revision of national policies of the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland) in the field of their security and defen.e. The degree of military and political tension in the North of Europe has increased significantly after 2014. The conflict is escalating due to additional deployment within the so-called reinforcement of the "eastern flank" of the Alliance with three allied battalions, and NATO weapons in the Baltic States and Poland. However, great strategic stability in the zone of direct contact between NATO and Russia is still possible to maintain. The international political situation in the subregion has also deteriorated markedly as a result of the U.S., NATO and EU sanctions policy against Russia, strengthening of transatlantic relations of the Nordic countries, and reinforcement of allied ties within the framework of the Western bloc policy as a whole. It noted signified not only a revision in favor of further strengthening of transatlantic ties in the policy of bloc allegiance of the Nordic countries - members of NATO (Denmark, Norway, Iceland), but also an obvious intensification of practical cooperation between formally non-aligned states (Sweden and Finland) with the Alliance structures. The Nordic Defen.e Cooperation (NORDEFCO) has also started to acquire a risky pro-Atlantic style, losing its previous autonomous subregional nature. Apparently, in the present complex situation, the Nordic Five is disposed to solve security and defence problems by: 1) having a greater many-sided cooperation with NATO; 2) giving a real, limited meaning to the European Union in the military-political sphere; 3) continuing to bear pressure upon Russia for the purpose of limiting Russian influence in the subregion, especially in the Baltic region. In the near future, the problem of NATO accession for Sweden and Finland may remain in the same precarious condition unless some dangerous force majeure circumstances occur in the Baltic region.

DT Article
DE self-regulation; interactions; meanings; social reality; youth;
   structural taxonomy; hierarchical clustering
AB The article provides a conceptual understanding of the semantic space of reality, substantiates its structure and features of its formation in the youth environment. To this end, we consider the process of meaning formation and the content of semantic fields. It is analyzed as the basis for self-regulation of social interactions between young people. Identifying semantic foundations of self-regulation is a relevant research task for both theory and practice. The aim of the study is to identify the structure of relationships and hierarchical clustering of basic elements in the mechanism for self-regulation of social interactions in the youth environment with the help of the structural and taxonomic model. The model was constructed within the framework of the tool for self-regulation of young people's daily life; the tool is being developed at the Center for Youth Sociology, Institute of Socio-Political Research, Federal Center of Theoretical and Applied Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences (ISPR FCTAS RAS). The structural and taxonomic approach allows us to obtain structural-taxonomic maps that display multi-layered structures of relationships within the mechanism of self-regulation, as well as connections between different meanings that are reproduced and constructed in the youth environment in the process of everyday interactions. In contrast to the automatic classification as the classical task of taxonomy, the structural and taxonomic approach focuses on identifying the structure of the most significant relationships between the objects being classified; such objects (which are considered in the present paper) are the elements of self-regulation mechanism in the life of young people. We design a structural and taxonomic model using the data of a sociological survey; this allows us to offer reasonable descriptions and explanatory interpretations of the results. The analysis is based on the findings of empirical studies we obtained in the course of a survey of Russian youth 15-29 years of age. We use taxonomic analysis to reveal the structure of the semantic space of young people. We conclude that semantic connections within and between semantic fields are ambiguous. Having implemented structural and taxonomic modeling of the semantic space, we identify several levels of semantic fields. Their analysis allows us to form an idea of the semantic foundations of self-regulation of young people's interactions with each other and with society.

DE wargame; international relations; decision-making process; political

AB In this article, the author raises the question of using wargames as a method of research in international relations. The paper analyzes the extensive historiographic base devoted to the issue of adapting classic military-historical simulation games to other fields of science, including international studies. The author thoroughly analyzes the experience of the Western academic community in applying wargames to obtain empirical data in researches on various topics and issues. The paper describes the main characteristics of wargames as a research methodology, mentions primary advantages and potential disadvantages while providing extensive examples of both. The author concludes that wargame is a valuable research tool, which allows the study of a wide range of topics, including those where the use of other research methods is impossible or limited. One of the bottom-lines of the article is that wargames can be considered both a qualitative and a quantative method of research, which makes imitational modeling a potential answer in the ongoing argument on the methodology more suitable for social sciences and international relations in particular. The author also pays special attention to the applicability of wargames to the subject sphere of international relations and touches upon the issue of the future of this mechanism in scientific research, taking into account the existing global trends. In particular, the author speaks of the objective need to develop unified mechanisms for the implementation of wargames in the digital environment, which would solve many potential issues and risks affecting the validity of the obtained results, and, in general, would simplify the use of wargames for scientific purposes. One of the important conclusions that are drawn in the paper is the objective need to digitalize existing wargames, which would allow to avoid existing complications of organizational nature, make wargaming more accessible and applicable to various types of research in the international relations studies.

AB The article investigates the changes in environment that occurred in response to economic processes during the COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2021), and related transformation of socio-political attitudes towards Green Policy and Green Economy. From the environmentalistic point of view, the pandemic played a twofold role. On the one part, it allowed the nature to "take a break" from an excessive anthropogenic pressure on the atmosphere and hydrosphere, and once again mobilized the humanity to reconsider the principles of interaction with the environment. On the other part, different types of pollution (daily and medical waste, plastic) increased dramatically; funding of international and national environmental programs was cut due to the economic recession worldwide. Nevertheless, the multidimensional crisis caused by the pandemic gave a new chance to the Green Economy. The most influential states of the world (the EU countries, USA, China and Russia) actively implement the Green Economy instruments at the state level. This process incorporates all economy sectors: finances, energy, industry, transport, agriculture and other. The European Union which had taken this path before the pandemic started is in an advanced position. At the same time, the foundations of the future environment-oriented economic policy are already enshrined in official documents (strategies, action plans, legislative acts, etc.) adopted by the leading nations thus far. Noteworthy is that the COVID-19 crisis has updated the green political and economic agenda globally, regardless of differences between the states, which verifies the importance and necessity of agreeing a conceptually new approach to interaction with the environment in the short and long term.

SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article studies sovereignty not only in relation to state, identity, or power but also in relation to the distinction between concepts of 'loneliness' and 'solitude.' Considering this goal, it analyses 'loneliness' as a concept with potentially deep explanatory value when posing major questions in political theory. It also explores its relationship with 'sovereignty' and 'political identity.' Building on the existing literature on the connection between sovereignty and collective identity, this study extends such analysis towards a consideration of the interconnection between sovereignty and different forms of loneliness and relates them to 'vertical' and 'horizontal' modes of 'organized loneliness.' The main aim is to use the framework of political representations of emotions to illustrate how a particular type of 'loneliness' - 'loneliness anxiety' - is filled with political reason. In empirical part, the article illustrates three specific models in which the 'management of loneliness anxiety' may provide legitimacy, including for Russia's conservative ideological program of 'state-civilization' and new 2020 amendments to constitution.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the relevance of biosecurity and biosafety issues, including such risks as the deliberate use of biological weapons, agroterrorism, and developments in life sciences with dual-use potential. Throughout its almost 50-year history, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) regime has faced many challenges, a majority of which have demanded attention ever since. For example, the problem of universality remains topical. The verification mechanism has not received enough development since 2001. Also, the BTWC regime has to face the inequality of economic, scientific and technological development of the States parties that, altogether with the inequalities in the BTWC implementation experience, makes the regime vulnerable. Amid these long-standing and profound issues new threats continue to emerge, like the erosion of global arms control and disarmament architecture as well as developments in science and technology. Even though States parties to the BTWC agree on the need to establish effective mechanisms for reviewing scientific and technological developments, there is no unanimity in approach or possible format. Moreover, agroterrorism, despite its increased relevance, is not covered properly within the BTWC regime. The list of challenges is extensive, however, there is a larger list of possible measures designed to strengthen this regime. Given that the sustainability of any regime is based on the political will of its members to comply, it is essential to enhance states' commitments and stimulate their interest through a variety of proposed measures. Joint activities, like the renewal of confidence building measures, addressing risks of biotetrorism, or reviewing scientific and technological developments related to the Convention, in particular, may give the impetus needed.

The authors applied a systematic approach to consider the introduction of distance education as an activity, which result depends on the current sociocultural conditions in the region, including the specifics of the population, the labor market, the socioeconomic and political situation, and the quality of teaching in educational organizations. The scientific novelty of the research includes the theoretical and methodological substantiation of a universal model for implementing distance education. It involves mandatory monitoring and support measures at all levels of administration: the micro(an educational organization), meso- (regional and municipal administration), and macroadministration (the State). Exploring the research problem, the authors revealed that distance learning effectiveness is directly connected with the quality of the regional analysis of sociocultural factors at the planning and forecasting stage.

AB The article is devoted to changes in the party-political system of Germany. Elections to the Bundestag are to be held in Germany on September 26. After 16 years of the leadership, Angela Merkel will not run for chancellor Currently, the main German political parties face challenges. Major parties lose electoral support. The emergence of a new party, the "Alternative for Germany", split votes, and makes it difficult to form a coalition. Parties should also overcome internal split and find their identity in a changing world. An analysis of the electoral programmes revealed that German political parties seek to return to traditional identity. CDU/CSU moves to the right, seeking to win back the AfG supporters. SPD and FDP in their electoral documents also appeal to their traditional electorate. The AfG's nomination of lead candidates supported by the right wing of the party also indicates that the "Alternative for Germany" will move towards radical right-wing positions. The Left Party comes out with radical leftist demands, which limits the possibility of its entry into the coalition. The most successful is the Green Party's electoral strategy. Party leaders abandoned radical demands of their predecessors. Greens advocate a citizen-supported climate program, but pay attention to the economic viability of reforms. According to polls, the black-green coalition (CDU/CSU and Union 90/Greens) seems the most likely. However, in the course of coalition negotiations, the parties may face difficulties in finding a compromise on tax policy and environmental reforms. At the same time, the parties have no significant contradictions on the foreign policy agenda (with the exception of a number of specific issues).

ID PEOPLES
AB The article reviews the materials of the journal "Nauchnoe obozrenie", which is a reliable source on the history of economic and socio-cultural development of the Russian Empire. The periodical press is one of the recognized historical sources containing the description of economic, political, social, religious, and cultural processes. The analysis of the methodology associated with the source value of periodicals indicates the validity of the choice of the journal "Nauchnoe obozrenie" as a source on the history of the development of the society of the Russian Empire at the end of the XIX century. The analysis of publications of 1898-1900 is made. The classification of publications by their subject is given: the materials of publications contain a large number of issues of an economic and industrial nature, as well as reflect geographical, environmental, physical-biological, anthropological, and philosophical data that either describe and supplement existing research by scientists, or are unique and accompanied by original author's judgments. It is worth noting that many publications reflect the research of not only Russian, but also German, French, Italian and Polish scientists, whose ideas and discoveries, in one way or another, were included in scientific discussions and influenced the further development of certain areas of scientific knowledge at the world level. The issues of the journal "Nauchnoe obozrenie" of 1898-1900 contain historical material that is valuable for the study of the history of the development of the Russian Empire, which was formed under the influence of many internal and external factors and discoveries. The journal also allows you to determine the course of the history of world civilization as a whole. Until now, the materials of this periodical have not been taken into account in historiography. This defect must be corrected, and the historical essays of the journal must be recognized as an important source for the study of the history of the development of the society of the Russian Empire.

   Schroeder; "people's parties"; rhetoric of success; democracy; image
AB The article is a study of the political phenomenon of German Chancellor A. Merkel, her special style of governance, objective factors and personal qualities that contributed to the construction of a long and successful career. The author analyzes in detail the period of governmental coalitions of the CDU/CSU with the SPD (2005-2009) and the FDP (2009-2013). It was the experience that had the greatest influence on the shaping of her image as a first female Chancellor of Germany. The theory of the difference between women's leadership and men's leadership is used in this paper. Through the prism of this theory we analyze the ways of struggle for leadership. The beginning of Merkel's career and the period of her ministerial activity were characterized by a harsh treatment of her rivals. Later she learned to do it in a softer way. The image of a consensual, supraparty leader, who knows how to find a compromise, is the result of Merkel's conscious work on herself. The need to be chancellor of a "grand coalition" and to cooperate with the SPD, an almost equal partner in terms of strength, contributed greatly to such a leadership style. The second legislative period helped A. Merkel to acquire the qualities of a "crisis manager". In the conclusion of the article it is concluded that the basis of A. Merkel's political survival was the ability to learn quickly and adapt during various difficulties. From this point of view, the Frau Chancellor's main "teacher" was her first rival, the Social Democrat H. Schroeder. It was his political fate that allowed Merkel to come to a conclusion about the need to combine the post of chancellor and party leadership, which allowed her to stay in power for 16 years.

ID EUROPEAN COURT; SECURITISATION
AB This paper revisits the traditional trade-off between privacy and security, which underpins the compatibility of general and indiscriminate mass surveillance (or bulk interception) with international human rights instruments, and extends the orthodox patterns of legal argumentation using interdisciplinary knowledge, which is able to nurture, and to be translated into, the language of International Human Rights Law. In search of new resources for the overburdened legal concept of privacy, this research combines a positivistic legal perspective with knowledge from sociologically framed surveillance studies, political theory, behavioural economics, and computer science, and deals with the threats and responses thereto from this epistemological standpoint. The first of three threats singled out in the paper-the 'securitisation' of the danger of terrorism-is treated through embedding the effectiveness of predictive algorithms to the proportionality test. The second one - a consensus of states to use bulk interception tools is suggested to be dealt with by transposition of issues of fair representation to the standard of review. The third threat, which is the shift of social norms towards the permissibility of being watched, is considered through the lenses of the complementation of an individual reading of privacy as a right and a value by a collective one.

DT Article
DE liberal democracy; traditionalism; antitraditionalism; problems of
   indentity; Christianity; sexual morality; gender policy
AB The article analyzes the ideological contradictions of liberal democracy, or neoliberalism (antiidentism), and traditionalism (identism) on the example of Christian churches. Antiindentism considers traditional religiosity to be hostile: it should be reformed to conform to neoliberal values, and it should be banished from public space. At the same time, antiidentism does not want to eliminate religion, because it is one of the identities that have to be redone like other human identites. The article examines anti-Christian movements (like the "Black Lives Matter") as well as conservative and liberal movements within various confessions. The authors emphasize that the antiidentist demands are based on the Christian values of respect for any person, for women and men, regardless of anything, for humane methods of raising children, mercy for any categories of people, regardless of their sexual orientation, etc. On the other hand, the demands of antiidentists go far beyond Christian principles and even common sense (not to quote inconvenient passages of the Bible, to change the rules of church life and the appointment of clergy). The article proposes a classification of confessions by direction and by territorial feature, depending on specifics of divisions based on the attitude to antiidentism (American Churches, the Catholic Church, Lutherans and Anglicans as well as diversity of Orthodox churches that are also touched by the antiidentist wave). The authors conclude that the Christian churches, despite the existence of liberal factions, are primarily a traditionalist force in modern politics. Because of fundamental ideological differences, the consolidation of diverse Christian forces is a difficult task. However, there is some progress in this direction. Evangelicals, traditional Catholics, who make up the majority of the Catholic Church, as well as the majority of Orthodox Christians, are a serious political and, what perhaps more important, ideological force.

AB Models for converting expert-coded data to estimates of latent concepts assume different data-generating processes (DGPs). In this paper, we simulate ecologically valid data according to different assumptions, and examine the degree to which common methods for aggregating expert-coded data (1) recover true values and (2) construct appropriate coverage intervals. We find that the mean and both hierarchical Aldrich-McKelvey (A-M) scaling and hierarchical item-response theory (IRT) models perform similarly when expert error is low; the hierarchical latent variable models (A-M and IRT) outperform the mean when expert error is high. Hierarchical A-M and IRT models generally perform similarly, although IRT models are often more likely to include true values within their coverage intervals. The median and non-hierarchical latent variable models perform poorly under most assumed DGPs.

ID SCIENCE
AB Data are presented for 2021 on the rating of Russian economics journals, taking into account their international success: entering the leading Web of Science and Scopus databases and presenting their content in English. The calculations carried out using the author's algorithm for ranking journals make it possible to establish that at present 25 Russian periodicals in economics have reached a sufficiently high scientific level and have become competitive in the international market of scientific products. If the concept of the market is interpreted in the broadest possible sense-as a set of competing participants entering into specific transactions that give them certain benefits, based on supply and demand for their services-then we can talk about a kind of revolution in the market of Russian economics journals due to the widespread use of strict academic standards and raising the scientific culture of domestic researchers. At the same time, the authors point to some negative aspects in the development of the pool of leading journals, including their high geographical concentration in only seven cities of Russia. Comparison of the parameters of the market for economics journals and the markets for journals in related disciplines-history, sociology, political science, and philosophy-showed that the competition for the right to be published in a prestigious Russian journal among economists is much higher than among representatives of other social sciences and humanities.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the confrontation between USA and China in the field of advanced technologies in Europe. On the example of the leading Chinese technological transnational company (TNC) Huawei which is the world leader in the development and deployment of advanced telecommunications networks of the fifth generation 5G it is shown that the confrontation between the US and China in the field of technology is a manifestation of intense competition at the interstate level that will increase. It is shown that the policy and increasingly tough US measures do not meet understanding and support from the many countries and this is clearly seen in Europe, which today is the main market for technological products of US and China and therefor has become the main arena of confrontation between them. The key EU countries in their evaluations and approach to cooperation with Huawei are guided primarily by their economic interests and put into practice a balanced and pragmatic approach. Amid tougher American sanctions and increasing political and economic pressure Chinese TNC Huawei maintained its position in the European market considering it as a strategic asset and alternative to the closed US market. An important factor in strengthening positions of Chinese companies in Europe would be implementation of EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investments.

AB The article outlines strategies of the largest European energy companies in the context of the EU climate policy aiming to accelerate the transition to a low carbon paradigm of development. For European oil and gas companies, the development of clean hydrogen projects is a natural policy since oil processing is the largest final consumer of hydrogen. Opportunities to increase production of new low-carbon energy sources are critical for European energy companies. It is concluded that hydrogen energy in Europe is developing in accordance with the algorithm previously applied in the sector of green renewable electricity. The driver of hydrogen projects is the political choice of the EU in favor of the green economy and decarbonization. Relatively high production costs allow companies to develop green hydrogen projects only relying on government support and large-scale subsidies from national and European budgets.

TI Cognitive Freedom as a New Political Freedom of the 21st century

ID LIBERTY
AB In political science, it is rarely possible to work with a topic of extremely significant social problems that has not yet found a proper understanding by the scientific community. This includes the concept of cognitive freedom, which already claims to be the new political freedom of the 21st century but is practically not represented in the scientific discourse. This article does not claim to be a complete theoretical and methodological representation of cognitive freedom as a political freedom, it is only an invitation to a discussion about its essence, features, practical significance, and many other aspects of this unique phenomenon. A review of publications on the topic of cognitive freedom from the point of view of psychological, neuro-ethical, epistemological, and cognitive trends is conducted; the degree of its study is evaluated; and the results obtained are summarized. The author's contribution to the understanding of cognitive freedom was the substantiation of the diffusive concept of cognitive freedom using a combination of two approaches: implicit cognitive science and political diffusionism. The diffusive concept of cognitive freedom can be formulated as follows: cognitive freedom is the freedom of representation, dissemination, and transmission of knowledge or information by individuals in diffusion networks. The concept "knowledge transfer" is introduced, meaning that its dissemination is carried out under conditions of some restriction of freedom in the form of prohibition, influence, pressure. This is the political nature of diffusion that acquires signs of managing or manipulating participants in the interaction. This concept should develop the concept of cognitive freedom in terms of one of the conditions for its implementation - the freedom to present, receive, distribute, and transmit knowledge in diffusion networks (a communication channel through which information and knowledge flow). The practical significance of the diffusive concept of cognitive freedom lies in its suitability for identifying the possibilities of managing the free process of political diffusion. Several cognitive technologies based on the principles of "cognitive control", which in fact plays the role of a kind of "limiter" or even an obstacle to the freedom of obtaining, storing or distributing knowledge, are described. The types of cognitive technologies are identified: technologies for managing human cognitive abilities at the level of the unconscious, technologies for managing the process of organizing information, technologies for strategic narratives, and framing technology: technologies for managing mnemonic practices, technologies for controlling social media as communicators.

AB The article examines the place and role of the Constitutional Court in the system of public powers in the doctrinal understanding of the concept of human rights and constitutionalism. The Constitution of the Russian Federation establishes the basic constitutional and legal principles that are fundamental to substantive and procedural law. Judicial constitutional review, as the experience of European countries shows, is the most effective in protecting the Constitution. The principles of law applied to the doctrinal assessment of the place and role of the Constitutional Court in the system of public powers constitute a rather dynamic legal concept. The methodology is based on the legal system, public relations, and the political-state course, which, like all fundamental ideas, change, affect legal awareness and establish new requirements for legal regulation and the formation of an appropriate mechanism. The article concludes that the most important condition for the implementation of the prerogatives of the judiciary to administer justice in the consideration and resolution of specific cases, with emphasis on the study and evaluation of evidence. It is the evidence that serves as the basis of information for the court's findings in the case.

DE political cartoon; concept; associative relations between concepts;

AB The article studies how cartoonists link the addressee of the cartoon (an average citizen of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) to the concept AGGRESSOR'S DEFEAT in 1941-45, making use of associative relations between concepts in the Russian language world picture and possibilities of different visualization methods. In political cartoons, codes of different semiotic systems cooperate, each of them has its own features. This fact implies that, during the study of political cartoons, different methods are employed: definitional, semantic, contextual, and elements of cognitive analysis. The study demonstrates that cartoonists link the addressee of a message to complex political questions with the help of everyday occurrences and notions from the addressee's nearest area, for example: 'desire to regale oneself with buns'. 'have an idea to grab somebody else's lands'; 'lack of heat from the fireplace in the room'. 'deprivation of fuel resources'; 'be beaten black and blue'. 'suffer a defeat'. The link to political questions is established with the help of both verbal and iconic means. Visual presentation of abstract notions is based on different visualization methods (1) metaphor, (2) association by contiguity, (3) comparison, (4) usage of the bridge meaning of the language unit, (5) usage of interrelation between meanings of a polysemous word. The analysis of cartoons created in 1941-45 proves that the notion 'suffer a defeat' is represented by elements which group in the associative field of the concepts PATRIOTIC WAR OF 1812 (e.g. retreat of Napoleon's army, cold weather) and FIST FIGHT (e.g. bruise, give smb a bloody nose). The notion 'loss of life' is represented by elements which group in the associative field of the concept DEATH: skeleton, cross, coffin, grave. The choice of a concept which refers to an element in the associative field of the concept AGGRESSOR'S DEFEAT can be caused by its capability to develop a certain connotation. For example, the German fascist's command staff perception of warfare is evaluated with the help of notions which group in the associative field of the concept CARD GAME. Taking into consideration the addressee's background knowledge about the history of their country, Russian folk observations fixed in proverbs and popular sayings, and the addressee's knowledge of Russian phraseological units which base on knowledge of life, cartoonists save on verbal means, ensure laconism of the message in the form of a political cartoon. The roundabout form of the message catches the eye of the addressee and gives an attractive form to political information. Verbal and visual supports related to the situation under discussion give contemporaries informed about the state of things an opportunity to decode and understand the message in the form of a political cartoon.

AB Focusing on the works and intellectual activity of the Sakha intelligentsia, this article examines the development of post-imperial political imagination in the region of Yakutia. The formation of the Sakha intellectuals was a result of the circulation of wider imperial discourses on nationalism, anticolonialism, socialism, and regionalism during the crisis of the Russian Empire. By discussing the Sakhas' marginal, even colonial, conditions, the Sakha national intellectuals followed self-governing aspirations inherited from political exiles and Siberian regionalists, whose ideas became frequent demands for many Siberian indigenous movements. Despite the Stalinist myth that the Soviet Union (and its social engineers) created autonomy in Yakutia for the first time in Russian history, it was the Sakha intellectuals who developed the autonomist discourse during the first two decades of the twentieth century.

DT Article
DE political culture; ruling regime; state decision-making; democracy;
   mechanisms of ethological subordination to power; public solidarity
AB The article reveals the relevant features of the Russian society's mass political culture dynamics. In this context, it is shown that, being an ordinary phenomenon, political culture transforms its value-oriented structures only under the influence of basic political transformations which determine the society's immediate environment. The restricted area of public administration, related to key policy decisions and dominated by interests affiliated with the government of the beneficiaries and corrupt practices, is considered to be the main factor shaping the social order and the organizational and political environment of the Russian population. Having become the most important means of resource allocation, network communications (supported by informational and symbolic means) have a systematic impact on the inhabitants of the country, trying to accustom people to informal methods of mastering public resources and to a cynical attitude to public requests. The proposed sociopolitical orders reinforce the basic value-orientation fractures of political culture. On the one hand, this contributes to the expansion of traditionalist, power-centric identification models that strengthen feelings of "patient inequality" and constantly slip to anthropic (activating fear, aggression, etc.) orientation mechanisms. These mechanisms evoke direct ethological subordination and biologically determined dependence on the centers of dominance. In the state bureaucracy, these mental changes give rise to many forms of irresponsible governmenance. On the other hand, the "disciplining" pressure of elite networks provokes an increase in the activity of young people and civil activists who are guided by the values of democracy and the priorities of human rights. As a result, the norms of network governance that corrupt people's consciousness and claim to be universal form new sources of cultural antithesis not only to the principles of democracy and humanism, but also to official institutionalism. As a result, social solidarity is declining in Russian society and the space of imposed consensus is expanding, which may lead to the growing tensions and patterns of an alienated civicism culture.

TI Migration as a National Security Challenge: Problems of Asylum Seekers'
   Adaptation (A Case of Tornio, Finland)
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE migration; national security; adaptation; asylum seeker; host community;
   Finland
AB The article considers approaches to the problems of contemporary migration flows to Europe in the context of ensuring national security, taking into account social and cultural contradictions between the local community and migrants. It begins with a brief overview of securitization theory, used as a theoretical tool to facilitate practical security analysis. Today we are witnessing a growing trend of migration securitization in Europe, which affects the position of migrants. The media and the Internet, being key sources of information, not only reflect the attitudes in society, but also construct stereotypical images of particular social groups, dividing into us or them, friends or foes, and can contribute to shaping a certain attitude of society towards its representatives. The theory of securitization distinguishes the following main threats to the national state from migrants: political threat, economic threat, social threat, and cultural threat. Social and cultural contradictions of migrants' integration are revealed on the basis of interviews with asylum seekers at the Tornio Refugees Reception Center (August-September 2016) regarding their stay in Finland and relationship with the host community, as well as on the basis of the authors' own observations. The authors believe that prerequisites for the fragmentation of European society are caused, on the one hand, by the desire of migrants to preserve values and norms of the traditional culture, and, on the other hand, by the clash of expectations (of both migrants and the host community) with real life, misunderstanding and refusal to accept host community traditions. The obtained results highlight the significant role of communication activities with the joint participation of locals and newcomers in understanding each others' culture, decreasing negative perceptions and reactions in the integration process. The study confirms the desire of migrants to preserve the values and norms of their own traditional culture. The elimination of social and cultural factors and lack of social contacts can lead to the formation of enclaves and potentially conflict situations. The article offers recommendations for improving general intercultural and interethnic communication in order to reduce the risk of forming closed social groups.

AB The article deals with the historical experience of the First World War and the Russian Civil War as it was brought up in Soviet propaganda of the 1920s and 1930s; topic is thus the employment of a "useful past" in the production of ideas about future wars. The present research is based on a corpus of normative texts related to the assessment of the First World War and the Civil War in the late 1920s and 1930s (including periodicals, political writings, materials of the Communist Party) as well as archival documents about campaigns dedicated to the anniversaries of the First World War and the Civil War. Despite their proclaimed policy of peace, Soviet leaders spoke of a major future war as inevitable, and tried to anticipate its nature through comparison with conflicts of the recent past. In the Soviet information space of the 1920s and 1930s, the Great War was presented primarily from a socio-political perspective. Assessing the First World War as imperialist, Soviet propaganda emphasized that the future conflict would inevitably start as a counter-revolutionary war against the USSR. The Civil War became the main source of heroic military discourse, and was presented as a national war against external enemies. The future war was thereby imagined on the model of the foreign interventions of 1918-1920. The author analyzes this approach with the example of the Soviet campaign dedicated to the twentieth anniversary of the defense of Petrograd from Yudenich's troops in 1919.

I draw on interviews with these professionals to map out their strategies of presenting and explaining the choice of specific developments to be cast as the turning points on their trajectory toward emigration. As the study demonstrates, most of them saw their personal circumstances as embedded within the broader political and social context they experienced in Russia. An important dimension of the story is their sense of what they present as inability to change their personal circumstances in Russia and the lack of prospects for broader changes.

AB The paper focuses on one of the most significant arenas of multi-level politics - the interaction between regionalist and state-wide parties in the creation and functioning of government coalitions at the regional level. The research is aimed at determining the factors influencing the creation of such coalitions in which regionalist parties act as coalition partners with a specific agenda. Spain provides significant empirical material for research on this issue, where regionalist parties function in most regions, and state-wide parties often enter government coalitions with them at the level of autonomous communities. A comparative analysis of the practices of concluding coalition agreements between state-wide and regionalist political parties in the regions of Spain during the democratic period is a key research method. The theoretical part of the article provides an overview of the theories of party coalitions accumulated by Political Science since the 1950s and updated by researchers due to actualization of new circumstances in the context of multilevel politics. The empirical part of the article examines the influence of three categories of factors on the construction of coalition deals between regionalist and state-wide political parties in the Spanish autonomous communities, including: the size of the coalition, the ideological inter-party distance (comprising the regionalist-ideological dimension) and correspondence of the alignments of party forces at the regional and national levels. The research demonstrates that the factor of coalition size is fundamental for transactions between regionalist and state-wide political parties, while the other two categories of factors manifest themselves situationally.

AB The article is dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the Academician N. N. Inozemtsev. The article provides an overview of the unpublished collective monograph "Foundations of the Theory of International Relations" - the fundamental work of a group of the IMEMO researchers, devised in the 1970s in the USSR. The process of creating a monograph is considered in the context of domestic and foreign policy conjuncture of that historical period, as well as the history of IMEMO. Among factors that slowed down the publication of this work were ideological transformations in the USSR, the divergence of political elite groups' interests. The main provisions of the monograph, based on a systematic approach and works by representatives of Marxism and Marxism-Leninism, are given. Particular attention is paid to comparison with the American and Western European international relations theory concepts of that period. Self-sufficiency of the monograph as a full-fledged theoretical concept within the framework of the Marxist-Leninist theory of international relations is substantiated. The authors of the article prove the relevance of the monograph both as a historical source and as a milestone for modern scientific Marxist thought. Owing to the collapse of the world socialist system, the Marxist paradigm received an opportunity to reach its own realism, separated from ideology and based on the central idea of Marxism - the position of development as an objective quality of the socio-historical process. The publication of the collective monograph "Fundamentals of the Theory of International Relations" is planned for the end of 2021.

According to the author, it is impossible to imagine all the complex of human identities, antagonisms, sympathies, and mutual understanding without taking into account specific features of religious symbolism. Thanks to these kinds of features religious sphere constantly interacting with different fields of law, politics, and international relations. As for the political field, the religious sphere is viewed in intrinsic triple connections: Religious Institutions - Statehood - Civil Society. This kind of approach tends to balance the principles of cultural heritage, secular state as well as of human rights and dignity.

AB The article summarizes the results of Russian-American relations during the presidency of Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, contains expert proposals for the normalization of bilateral relations based on guided modeling and economic diplomacy as an alternative to the policy of liberal capitalism in the near-term. In 2020, political and economic relations between Russia and the United States have reached a "bottom" and now require urgent improvement. The main aim of this article is to reveal the reasons for the deterioration of these relations and present expert proposals for their normalization. The research question or hypothesis of this article is to concretize the political agreements between Russia and the United States on diplomatic relations over the entire history of their existence and to form the current agenda in the third decade of the 21st century. This problem should be solved in two ways: empirically and practically. At the theoretical level, it is advisable to use the method of epistemology (i.e., an in-depth study of the subject of research) and the method of synergetics (obtaining new information based on interdisciplinary analysis and synthesis). The expert suggestions of the article's author are recommendatory in obtaining the necessary information and new knowledge aimed at updating the Concept of Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation, improving Russian-American relations and improving the world order. The article describes the essence of the international problems of our days, examines in detail the political contacts at the top and the only full-scale meeting of the presidents of the two world powers in recent years, presents the expert's own view of a new stage in relations between Russia and the United States during the world structural crises. The article also contains an explanation of the need to conclude new agreements and proposes a draft of the main sections of the treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States. One of the significant subsections of the article is economic diplomacy as an alternative to the economic policy of liberal capitalism.

AB The author discusses the question Ilya Kasavin formulated about the correspondence of the values of scientific knowledge and the ideals of humanism. She shows that the connection between the values of scientific knowledge and the ideals of humanism was laid during the Enlightenment. The ontological concepts of the unity and order of nature are transferred to the concepts of methodology of knowledge, the knowing subject, and society as a whole. From here follows the interpretation of progress as a linear movement towards cognitive unity and social harmony, which are recognized as public goods. Science today no longer promises to bring multiple experiences and multiple subjective individual and collective points of view into a unity that expresses the intelligible and simple order of nature, on the one hand, and the order of society, on the other. On the contrary, today's scientists, philosophers, and social theorists say that the further science advances, the more cognitive and social diversity we acquire. The article analyzes the conditions for the possibility of interpreting cognitive diversity as a public good. It is shown that with the belief in progress shaken in the postmodern era, the values of scientific knowledge and humanism retain interconnection and social significance. The transformation that they, nevertheless, undergo, consists in a shift in emphasis from the results of knowledge to the process of knowledge.

AB The article reviews scientific concepts, models, and scenarios related to the digitalization of contemporary social and political communication processes. The authors consider the main approaches to determining the content and features of the global digitalization impact on the transformation of socio-political practices. The article presents scientific positions regarding the role of digital technologies in contemporary public consciousness management. Special attention is paid to scientific scenarios of digital transformation and its impact on the traditional political system. Based on the analysis of scientific works, the authors identified the critical threats, risks, and challenges in ensuring state sovereignty and national security in the context of technological transformations. The research procedure and methods are based on a discourse analysis of Russian and foreign scientific works devoted to the socio-political aspects of contemporary digitalization and its role in the functioning and transformation of contemporary institutions of power, as well as on a critical analysis of the approaches proposed by contemporary political science to the study and understanding of the digitalization phenomenon. Simultaneously, discourse analysis, as the primary methodological optics, was used taking into account the principles of the hermeneutics of the existing scientific approaches. The discourse analysis of various scientific concepts, models, and scenarios of digitalization of social and political communications carried out in the course of the study allows the authors to conclude that the traditional social reality known to us is rapidly evolving into a new, socio-technical reality (phygital world), which has its own pronounced distinctive features. Based on the study results, the authors conclude that today the global architecture of a new socio-technical reality is being created in the world, based on the dominance of digital communication technologies in key spheres of life of the contemporary state and society. The work shows that many scientists, whose works were analyzed within the framework of the article, express serious concerns about the possibility of setting regimes of "soft dictatorships" based on control over information and communication processes in the sociopolitical space, on the formation of a distorted digital reality, on the reduction of opportunities for citizens to actively and consciously participate in contemporary political processes.

DT Article
DE Greece; party system; electoral system; bipartisanship; left radicalism;
   right populism; nationalism; euroscepticism; clientelism
AB The article examines the Greek party system under the Third Republic and identifies the key trends in its development during the years of the "great recession" (2008-2016) and the subsequent post-crisis recovery. Economic and social cataclysms led to the political fragmentation, the decline of the once largest party PASOK, the rise of radical parties, both left and right wing. However, the period of political chaos was short-lived. As a result, Greece has come to a quasi-two-party system, similar to the one that functioned in the pre-crisis decades. The return to normalcy was partly caused by the failure of the anti-European agenda, which brought SYRIZA and Independent Greeks to power in 2015 on the crest of a populist wave. But there were other reasons. First, the revitalization of the bipartisan system was facilitated by a reinforced proportional electoral system, which gave 50 bonus seats to the leading party. Second, political competition is constrained by the conservatism of Greek society, its weak susceptibility to new ideas (liberal, "green", regionalist, etc.). Third, bipartisanship is cemented by widespread clientelistic ties between the largest parties and voters who receive public sector jobs and other benefits in exchange for their loyalty. Fourth, the lion's share of media resources is concentrated in the hands of a small number of media moguls associated with the leading parties, and citizens receive rather scant information about smaller political actors. These factors contribute to political stability, but at the same time they limit political competition, which poses serious risks for the country.

AB Throughout the years of the existence of the Italian Republic, the country's political system has been characterized by both periods of stability and turbulence. The article presents a comprehensive analysis of the transformation of the Italian party-political system and political landscape, macro-tendencies of Italian politics from the First Republic (1948) to the present. The research highlights the main features of each period. The authors reflect on the possible emergence of the Third Republic in Italy. The study is relevant in view of the growing government crisis in the Italian Republic, aggravated by the epidemiological situation. Among the main trends that characterize the modem political system, the authors underline increasing heterogeneity, the emergence of coalitions that are formed not in accordance with political programs and political values, but with the political situation based on the principle "here and now"; tendency towards personification of parties, and increasing fragmentation of political spectrum. This gives a ground to deliberate on a possible existence in Italy of "liquid politics" (politica liquida) as a state of continuous political system "melting and overflowing" in the absence of a clear ideological delimitation - one of the stages at which a new political reality is being constructed.

ID SOCIAL STIGMA
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased interest in studying social stigma. The concept of stigma is also included in political discourse, as evidenced, among other things, by Xi Jinping's speeches, in which the Chinese President urges to abandon further politicization and stigmatization of COVID-19. In this regard, the main aim of the article is to analyze the correlation between the novel coronavirus and stigmatization, not only from the traditional point of view (stigma associated with certain diseases), but also in terms of world politics. To explain the nature of social stigma, the author relies on evolutionary psychology, terror management theory and social identity theory. To analyze ongoing processes in international relations, some provisions of "rogue states" concept, leadership theories, and biopolitics are applied. The primary sources are documents of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Group of Seven (G7), statements by UN and WHO officials, speeches of Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump, public opinion polls, and media publications. During the course of the study, the following scientific results were obtained: the works on COVID-19-related stigma have been systematized, the issues considered in them and research gaps are highlighted; the consequences of stigma due the novel coronavirus have been summarized; some differences between stigma during the pandemic and stigma associated with other diseases are also identified; it is suggested to consider COVID-19 stigma not only at the level of interpersonal interactions, but also in international relations; the possible impact of the pandemic on the China's role on the world stage has been revealed. It is concluded that this research approach allows to take a fresh look at the possibility of restoring ties between states and their citizens in a post-COVID-19 world, as well as to assess the likelihood of a change of global leader. In the final part of the article, possible ways of further development of the situation are predicted and prospects for study on the issue are outlined.

The stylized examples allow to highlight the impact of reforms on human capital, including vitality, health and life expectancy. Within the framework of an interdisciplinary approach, it is shown that many psychologists, sociologists, political scientists, doctors and linguists share the opinion about the impact of institutional changes on the viability of the population. The proposed simple model of economic growth demonstrates the principle of the need to dose reforms, i.e. to limit their scale, depth and speed of implementation. This strategy in contrast to shock therapy is called adaptive reform. The article examines the interaction between institutional reforms and human capital. As a starting point of the analysis, the phenomenon of Stevenson's depopulation is used, which consists in the mass extinction of the natives of Polynesia under the influence of the forceful imposition of new standards of life by the colonists. These stylized examples allow us to focus on the impact of reforms on human capital in terms of the vitality, health and life expectancy of an individual. The analogy between the phenomenon of Stevenson's depopulation and the decrease in the population during the institutional reforms in Russia in the 90s is considered. Within the framework of an interdisciplinary approach, it is shown that many psychologists, sociologists, political scientists, doctors and linguists share the opinion about the impact of institutional changes on the viability of the population. The main thesis of these studies: a person's health is not only inside him (his body and consciousness), but also outside (in the social environment and psychological environment). A simple model of economic growth is proposed, from which the paradox of reforms follows, when productive institutional changes generate an economic downturn. The analysis of the conditions for the emergence of this paradox shows that the scale, depth and speed of reforms should be strictly dosed, otherwise their negative impact on people can outweigh the positive organizational effect inherent in them. It is shown that in addition to institutional changes, technological progress also has a destructive impact on human capital, which is also incorporated into the proposed model of economic growth.

TI CONFLICT OF INTEREST: LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CONFLICTOLOGY
SO PRAVOPRIMENENIE-LAW ENFORCEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Corruption; type of corruption; corruption factor; employee; official;
   law enforcement; conflict of interests; nepotism; way to prevent
   conflicts of interest
AB The subject. The article is devoted to conflictology as one of the most relevant, almost significant, debatable problems in law theory, legal sciences, political science, philosophy, psychology and economics. The author analyzes specific examples of conflicts of interest in various corruption spheres and manifestations, for example, in the sphere of participation of economic actors in the procurement announced by state and municipal authorities.
   The methodology. The author uses comparisons of common and private, cause and effect, patterns and randomness, content and form, essence and phenomenon, the transition of quantity into quality, as well as the methods of sociology and psychology.
   The main results, scope of application. The article analyzes the relationship between corruption and nepotism. The article discusses legal and moral ways to prevent conflict, the role of ethical standards in conflict prevention, regulatory framework for preventing and settling them, the ratio of conflict of interest and employee qualifications, balance of material and personal interest, Commissions to prevent conflicts of interest, guaranteeing the role of writing notice of a conflict of interest, Features of the notification procedure, moral means of preventing and resolve conflicts of interest. Exclusively legal methods are insufficient to prevent and eliminate conflicts of interest and corruption-related risks. A combination of legal and moral measures is necessary, and most importantly, the exclusion of kinship and other forms of nepotism in the formation of government bodies and the appointment of officials, the hiring of state and municipal employees. It is necessary to exclude formalism from the institution of competitive selection of civil servants.
   Conclusions. The elimination of the contradictions between some federal anti-corruption laws has much less effect on the state of corruption in the state than the flourishing nepotism. The exercise of official functions takes place in the form of law enforcement: if there is no application of the law - there is no corruption. The main emphasis should be directed to the process of forming the apparatus of state and municipal authorities, employees of state and municipal institutions, primarily in the educational sphere, on which the upbringing of new generations of employees depends, the steady observance of high professional and moral requirements imposed on state and municipal employees and teachers in schools and universities.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE social meaning; contextualization; language ideology; political
   correctness; over-politicization
AB The article addresses two central notions, namely social meaning and political correctness. The concept of social meaning is well known in "third wave" sociolinguistics, which connects patterns of language variation with the wider social world, in metapragmatics after Michael Silverstein, language ideology research and discourse analysis. The analysis is in line with these research approaches and also reflects back the pragmatic interpretation of social meanings. It is presumed that the social meaning of a word or an utterance is indexical in its nature and conveys information about the social context of language use. Social meaning of an utterance reflects its social embeddedness. In this respect, the perspective of political correctness reflects the discursive process of social indexicality and social meaning making. The article examines modern cases of political correctness (PC) in the USA (2017-2020) to show the effects of discursive pressure on interpretation frames. PC is discussed as a controversial practice and it is aimed at avoiding expressions or actions that can be perceived to marginalize or insult socially disadvantaged and discriminated people. At the same time, it can overpoliticize issues and act as a struggle against implicit meanings and implicatures.

TI SOCIAL DIALOGUE IN RUSSIA: CONSTITUTIONALIZATION AND EXPANDING THE LEGAL
   CONTENT OF THE CONCEPT
SO PRAVOPRIMENENIE-LAW ENFORCEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Constitution; social partnership; social dialogue; social solidarity;
   labor law; principles of law; principles of social partnership; Labor
   Code
AB The subject of research is the concept of social dialogue in labor and relations directly related to them that was enshrined by Russian Constitution for the first time in Russian history in 2020.
   The purpose of article is to confirm or disprove hypothesis that the constitutionalization of social dialogue, the unprecedented expansion of the legal content of the concept to a much wider range of social relations (that are no longer associated exclusively with the social and labor sphere) requires a new definition of the social significance of social dialogue, its connection with other social processes and institutions.
   The methodology of research is formal legal and logical interpretation of Russian Constitution and labor legislation, analysis of the academic publications concerning labor law.
   The main results, scope of application. The constitutionalization of social dialogue requires to identify it's interrelation with other social processes and institutions - economic, political and social solidarity, social responsibility of business, civil society, the social state. The author tries to trace the transformation of the conceptual apparatus, content and regulatory framework of social dialogue and develops recommendations for improving its legal regulation. Based on the analysis of the practice of applying articles of the amended Russian Constitution, it is proposed to amend Art. 23 of Russian Labor Code. At the same time, the content of the elements of this system of social dialogue in the field of labor relations will be disclosed in articles of the second and thirteenth sections of Russian Labor Code. It is proposed to amend the normative acts adopted in accordance with the Russian Labor Code containing the appropriate terminology. Normative acts of social dialogue (sectoral tariff agreements and collective agreements), the effect of which is limited in time, can be updated simultaneously with the planned measures for the development and conclusion of relevant acts for the future period.
   Conclusions. Ensuring the implementation of the principles of social dialogue is entrusted by the Constitution to the Government of the Russian Federation. The content of these principles is disclosed in the norms of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation. With the entry into force of amendments to the Constitution, these scientifically grounded and legislatively enshrined principles do not need a radical revision based only on the very fact of the appearance of the corresponding constitutional provision. At the same time, the work on their analysis and filling with new legal meaning based on the rule-making and current law enforcement practice is not excluded and can be useful.

TI THE STRATEGIC EMPATHY IN THE WORLD POLITICS: IS IT POSSIBLE TO OVERCOME

SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE human capital; psychological factors; foreign policy; Rashomon effect;
   causal attribution; psychology of international relations
AB Political and psychological factors, in particular the Rashomon effect (a plurality of parallel 'true' versions) and the fundamental attribution error, provide us with capacity to give a more insightful description of the mechanism of the emergence of internal political and international conflicts of varying intensity in our increasingly complex world. They also reveal the anatomy of turbulent global processes that on a mass level, have formed a presentiments of apocalyptic catastrophes, which, moreover, is fueled by propaganda. In political communication, the fundamental attribution error is expressed in the fact that many politicians and journalists tend to overestimate the positive characteristics of 'us-group' (their country) and ignore situational factors when assessing the behavior of 'others', 'their-groups'. Because of the fundamental attribution error, politicians and the media tend to evaluate the actions of the opposing side as negative actions and ignore situational factors that could play a role. This is a typical source of an 'alternative truth' in the media, biased judgments and misunderstandings that can aggravate international relations. The author argues that causal attribution errors feed irrational nationalist feelings, although the psychological mechanisms of this process are still poorly explored. As a method of overcoming the psychological mechanisms of reality distortion, the author proposes a wider use of the strategic empathy toolkit.

AB The article provides a brief overview and critical analysis of the difficulties and challenges facing theoretical sociology considered in the context of the current discussion of the "crisis of sociological theory". Both "internal" and "external" problems and challenges, the latter being related to the social context and internal organization of the social sciences, are considered. In particular, among the "internal" factors of the current crisis in relation to sociology, the author states the relative shortage of robust observable phenomena constraining competing theoretical interpretations, the insufficient attention of sociologists to conceptualization and empirical validation of methods for measuring theoretical constructs, as well as the specific difficulties of causal inference in the sciences that include causal relationships between subjective (mental) variables. Among the "external" factors of the social context, some aspects of the transformation of the role of academic knowledge about society in the era of "knowing capitalism", as well as political and ideological influences on theoretical discourse are examined.

DE Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; USSR;

AB This article analyses economic reforms in Hungary and Bulgaria between the late 1950s and early 1970s, as well as the reaction of official Moscow to the changes in these countries. The main sources for this article were documents of the Soviet embassies in the HPR and the PRB, briefing notes of Soviet economists, reports of special services and materials of meetings and negotiations at the highest party and state level. The authors conclude that a significant role in the launch and curtailment of reforms belonged to the political leaders of Hungary and Bulgaria - Ya. Kadar, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the HSWP, and T. Zhivkov, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the BCP, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the PRB. Therefore, at the level of decision-making, these reforms differed from similar ones in other countries of the socialist camp. The authors demonstrate that the transition to self-supporting relations in the HPR and PRB did not solve a number of economic problems, but, on the contrary, provoked a departure from socialist principles and the strengthening of market elements. This circumstance led to an increase in the volume of external debt of Hungary and Bulgaria, mainly to capitalist countries, which caused concern on the part of the Soviet leadership. Therefore, the Kremlin, which had previously pursued a policy of detached observation, forced Zhivkov and Kadar to curtail economic reforms. At the same time, Moscow offered individual solutions in each case. In Bulgaria, for example, the economic independence of enterprises ended after the USSR repaid the country's internal debt, and in Hungary after Brezhnev's conversation with Kadar. The authors believe that the direct initiator of the curtailment of reforms in the HPR and the PRB was a rather narrow circle of Soviet leaders who realised the futility of introducing market mechanisms into the socialist economy and launched a large-scale revision of the concept of the development of the world system of socialism in the early 1970s.

ID POLITICS; WAR
AB The article explores the experience of the political use of the historical past in the post-Yugoslav space on the example of two key states in the region - Serbia and Croatia. Serbo-Croatian rivalry, twice in the 20th century turning into bloody confrontation, left a deep imprint on the politics of memory of these polities. Serbian and Croatian historical narratives describing the events of the Second World War and the armed conflicts of 1991-1995 not only compete with each other, but offer incompatible interpretations. There are reasons to speak in this case about the emergence of a mnemonic security dilemma. The dilemma in question implies that the systematic challenge of a certain narrative, significant for the "biography" of the community and the state behind it, ultimately undermines the confidence of the community representatives in the stability of its existence. In these conditions, the conflict of memories becomes an important and even a constituent element of the formation of a macro-political identity. As the dynamics of Serbo-Croatian relations show, the dilemma of mnemonic security is quite inertial and stable; it can persist and hinder post-conflict settlement, even in a significantly changed international political context when the main prerequisites for confrontation are becoming a thing of the past. The article also analyzes the contradictory influence of the European integration processes on the politics of memory in Croatia and Serbia.

   Macron's policy
AB The article analyzes the French experience of institutionalization of the political elite's recruitment process. Although there are various channels for the recruitment of the French political elite, the education system is central in creating a framework, norms and procedures to train civil servants who make up the core of the political elite. The main issue is how appropriate it is for the state to have an active engagement in the process, characterised by the formation of a separate ecosystem of schools empowered to train the political elite, unequal financing, specific process of employment. On the one hand, such a system is increasingly close to meritocratic ideals, ensures the foreseeability of methods and expertise of the ruling class. On the other hand, it provokes criticism about the alleged closeness of the political elite, the divide between elite's mindset and lifestyle and those of the majority of population. The "yellow vests" protest against the Parisian political elite fueled discontent, making the government commit to reform what is widely thought to be the main pillar of elitism in the French education - the National School of Administration. The article analyzes whether ENA's reform really changes the recruitment procedure and makes the political elite more open and representative, leading to a comprehensive reform of elite education. It studies the key recruiting education institutions, calculates the concentration indexes and assesses the real role of the National school of Administration in the process of recruitment. While studying the strengths and weaknesses of the system and the French government's efforts to mitigate them, the French experience characterised by a high level of institutionalization is compared with the British one, where the education system is as efficient a channel of recruitment, despite being less regulated. In conclusion, the authors suggest possible measures for an optimal reform of the elite education system in order to preserve its advantages.

AB The article approaches the phenomena of modern political conflicts and conflict studies, with the intention of providing an adequate level of information and scientific-educational resources to provide a basis for public political discourse. The authors introduce a new unique interface for political scientists that connects political science to public political discourse - an electronic resource of systematized literature on political science and political documents in the format of an online library of books, articles, reports, documents (Domestic Politics of Russia and International Politics). This resource has been created by the Russian Political Science Association and Institute for International Studies of the MGIMO University with support from the Russian Foundation for Fundamental Research and the Expert Institute for Social Research. It suggests new cataloguing system for political science literature by 59 thematic clusters that represent a renewed classification of political science subdisciplines and thematic areas. Among other types of information, this new resource covers political science publications from major Russian publishing houses specializing in humanitarian scientific literature and textbooks, as well as the most advanced scientific articles published by 25 Russian political science journals. The resource is intended to provide information and bibliographical support underlying modern scientific discourse in Russia focused on urgent issues of Russian domestic politics and international politics.

AB This article analyses behaviour strategies during conflict, including constructive and destructive aspects, institutional frameworks and considers the possibility of integrating territorial communities into decision-making systems in urban development. The research was based on an expert survey. Its geography covers three regional centers of the Russian Federation: Voronezh, Krasnodar and Yaroslavl. In total, thirty-four experts were interviewed representing various professional groups (urban communities, non-profit organizations and civil initiatives, regional and the local authorities, business structures, and academia). The theoretical basis of the research is the approach, which identified the main strategies of behaviour of participants in conflict situations. Based on the results of the study, it can be argued that the main prerequisites for the creation of communities are territorial identity and the presence of specific problems in a certain territory. Strategies of interaction with other subjects of urban conflicts are, as a rule, non-confrontational in nature. More often than not, communities choose cooperation and compromise, although such strategies are not always effective. This is due to the lack of resources to more actively defend their interests. In the structures of conflicting communities, a 'core' of activists is usually distinguished, but the leader's role is also great. Through the latter, a significant part of the community's communications is carried out, the definition of strategies, the formation of the agenda. The study shows that urban communities remain insufficiently integrated into the system of political and administrative decision-making and public policy institutions, which also complicates the integration of urban communities into mechanisms for constructive conflict regulation.

DE intergenerational digital divide; digital literacy; social networking
AB The preamble analyzes discourse on understanding the digital intergenerational divide. The key approaches to the conceptualization of this concept through the prism of socioeconomic and generational approaches in foreign and Russian research discourse are considered. There is a lack of approaches to the analysis of the features of social network behavior of digital and pre-digital generations, their cooperation and conflict in the use of social media. A new conceptualization of the digital generational divide is proposed as a dynamic unity of network communication cooperation (with elements of mentoring and patronizing from the younger ones within family communities) and network conflict isolation (based on voluntary social platform segregation). Based on the assessments and opinions of representatives of the digital generation, identified as a result of a series of field studies within the framework of a research project dedicated to the study of the network culture of the digital generation, generational differences in the profiles of digital competencies are identified, the mechanisms of digital literacy transmission and platform adjustment are analyzed as manifestations of the digital generational divide. In particular, there is a high self-assessment of the level of development of digital competencies on the part of young people and criticality in relation to their digital skills of elders, the presence of a subjective awareness of the digital intergenerational gap on the part of the respondents. Based on the method of mirror mutual assessment by representatives of digital/pre-digital generations of digital competencies and user behavior of each other, the corresponding competence deficits of each generation are identified. The extra-institutional nature of the social network cyber socialization is determined, when its key agents are peers and bloggers, rather than parents and teachers. With regard to the broadcast of digital skills, the phenomenon of "reverse mentoring" and the practice of "digital patronizing/dependence" are described, when grandchildren and children lead their personal accounts for the elderly and carry out online communications with government institutions. Partial platform intergenerational voluntary segregation is analyzed as a trend of "communicative fashion", a way of communicative detachment from elders and a manifestation of the generational digital divide.

DT Article
DE Soviet Union; family; peasantry; rural family; historical demography;
   urbanisation; demographic transition; family policy
AB This review article analyses approaches to the study of the rural family of the Soviet period that have taken shape in foreign (mainly Western) historiography between the 1960s and the present. The rural family was in the focus of social and political transformations of the twentieth century, suffered a severe deformation as a result of world and civil wars, as well as the urbanisation process, which took on a forced character under the influence of state policy measures. The article is intended to help bring together the methodological and thematic positions of Russian and foreign researchers in considering the phenomenon of the rural family.
   The study of the Soviet rural family, usually in a wider thematic context, began in line with the "anthropological" turn at the turn of the 1970s. At the suggestion of T. Shanin, family households entered the focus of the emerging peasant studies. Methodological preferences, as well as the relatively small number of available primary statistics, determined the limited interest of Western authors in the historical and demographic study of the Soviet rural family. In the 1980s and 1990s, within the framework of the revisionist paradigm, the rural family was studied mainly as an object of influence from the authorities (radical projects of the 1920s, collectivisation, and measures to strengthen the family in the 1930s). "Feminist" historiography was especially active in this field. In the second half of the 1990s and early 2000s, time came for balanced characteristics, quite free from politicised assessments. There was an opportunity to consider the Soviet family and family policy in a global context. The post-war period in the development of the rural family is represented in foreign works rather poorly. In general, Western authors managed to capture the directions of evolution and the new quality of the rural family, which have become apparent in the later Soviet decades.

AB The article is devoted to a genealogy of the attitude toward viruses in social and political practice in light of the new coronavirus pandemic. The disciplinary society and the society of control have taken on a completely new configuration since the HIV crisis in the 1980s. AIDS and now COVID-19 as phenomena of social crisis have had a great impact on (sexual) relationships and have also caused a significant change in the social and political order. Epidemics and pandemics mobilize political structures and constitute power relations, thus changing the way bodies are controlled, establishing new differentiations and redefining what disease is. The authors trace the development of discourses about syphilis, AIDS and COVID-19 to describe how knowledge about the disease is being generated today; it has origins in myth and would be unthinkable without aesthetic visualization and mass media technologies. Syphilis was an exact fit for the paradigm of the disciplinary society, which stigmatized bodily pleasure and abstracted pathology by activating projection mechanisms as a sign of the Other. However, AIDS already differed significantly from that paradigm because other medical technologies are used to define HIV, and that has affected the epistemology of the disease and epidemic.
   The article considers HIV/AIDS as a transitional model that forms a bridge between the epidemics of the past (leprosy, plague, smallpox, syphilis) and the COVID-19 pandemic. Above all there is a change in the biopolitical regime so that bodies are no longer controlled and regulated through sexuality. COVID-19 is a new form of sociality which is not based on the exclusion of "pathological" forms of sexuality or on "deviant" or "perverted" bodies, but involves the object-based, micro-level of relations between viruses, the immune system, and the human genome, which are then mapped with distortions and substitutions onto social relationships and practices. The authors use the term "delegated control" in a new context and introduce the original term "omniopticum" to describe the new regime of biopolitics and the "control society" in the post-COVID era.

AB In 2014, the United States, the European Union (EU) countries and some other states have imposed economic sanctions against Russia. The overcoming of sanctions requires an understanding of their effectiveness. Thus, we aimed to identify factors of the effectiveness of economic sanctions by reviewing the literature that considers sanctions as a tool for transforming the current national policies. The applied methodology of the systematic literature review (SLR) includes the following stages: 1) determining a basic sample of publications based on a keyword search in Web of Science, Scopus, Russian Science Citation Index, SSRN, EBSCO, Ideas/RePec, Google Scholar, Cambridge University Press, Routledge, De Gruyter ISTOR, Springer, Taylor & Francis; 2) identifying a representative sample based on the authors' criteria (type of publication, language, character, content and context); 3) synthesising the representative sample; 4) reporting the research results. A method of comparative and graphical analysis was used to present the findings. The analysis of relevant literature allowed us to conclude that economic sanctions are more effective if 1) sanction costs for a target country are higher than for a sender, including those occurring as a result of regional inequality; 2) sanctions are designed as a short-term measure; 3) sanctions are multilateral and imposed by international institutes, including through regional trade agreements; 4) sanctions are targeted at democratic regimes. Moreover, the most preferred type of sanction - targeted (smart) sanctions - are less effective in achieving their goals than traditional comprehensive ones. Further review studies may focus on targeted economic sanctions (first and foremost in Russia) and include publications, analysing case studies of individual countries and industries.

   Krzhizhanovsky; industrialization; revision of the GOELRO plan; Second
   plan for the electrification of the USSR
AB In December 1920, the Eighth All-Russian Congress of Soviets approved the State Plan for the Electrification of Russia (GOELRO). A great number of works devoted to the Plan have been published over the past century. These sometimes mutually contradictory works discussed different aspects of this plan but mostly focused on the success of its implementation. This paper analyses the history of the creation and implementation of the GOELRO Plan, based on a thorough historico-technical study of the entire body of available archive documents. The authors were determined to avoid biased interpretation of the Plan's content and implementation, to maintain a balance in acknowledging positive sides of the electrification program and the shady aspects of its implementation, and to take into account the overall technical and sociopolitical context of the period in question.
   As a result of our studies, the following conclusions are for the first time submitted to the judgment of the scientific community. The GOELRO Plan was a purely national program. It had not been a product of the October Revolution but, rather, had clearly discernable pre-Revolutionary roots. It is not easy to provide a correct answer to the question of its implementation because of the following circumstances. Rather than being a complete, self-contained program, GOELRO was, according to V.I. Lenin and G.M. Krzhizhanovskii, only the "first step" on the path of Russia's industrial development. Due to the difficult political and economic situation, the implementation of the Plan only began in December 1921, one year after its approval by the Congress of Soviets. The fact that all power facilities whose construction began before 1920 were included in the GOELRO Plan should also be taken into account. The contours and content of the Plan were revised and updated throughout the 1920s in accordance with the changing economic situation in the country. With the beginning of the industrialization, i.e. before the results of its implementation were summarized and evaluated, the working out of the first Plan for the Development of National Economy of the USSR (19281932) was drawing upon the GOELRO Plan. Nevertheless, it has been the GOELRO Plan that made it into history as a program that laid the foundations for the systemic development of Soviet power engineering and industry as a whole.

AB As the transmission belt between citizens and their government, lawyers are a critical component of civil society. Yet their relevance depends on society's willingness to call upon them and on the state's openness to being challenged. In the U.S., we take the political importance of lawyers for granted. Elsewhere, especially in authoritarian countries, lawyers play a more peripheral role. This Essay focuses on Russian lawyers. Although there is a large literature on various types of Russian lawyers, their status in society has not been much explored. The Essay tracks the evolution in societal attitudes towards lawyers in Russia, beginning with the Soviet period (1917-1991) and continuing through the post-Soviet period (1992-present). Drawing on memoirs, public opinion polling, and surveys, the Essay documents lawyers' low status in the Soviet Union. The introduction of market institutions in post-Soviet Russia opened the door to new types of lawyering, many of which are highly remunerated. The effect has been to increase the attractiveness of the profession to Russian youth and their parents and increase its esteem more generally.

AB The article presents some of the findings of a survey among the low-mobility groups on the availability of social support, participation in social communications, and attitudes towards solidarity during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The pandemic has sharpened the issues of accessibility and inclusion of the institutional environment, while the role of mutual assistance and non-state actors in the well-being of the population has noticeably increased. In this article, we aim to capture the broader panorama of responses to the pandemic, focusing our perspective on people with limited mobility. The survey involved 540 respondents representing three groups with limited mobility: people with disabilities, elderly people experiencing difficulties with movement, pregnant women and parents of children under three years of age. With the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020, the living conditions of many social groups have deteriorated due to the imposed quarantine and forced self-isolation of the population. The deteriorating position of low-mobility groups has become a matter of concern for international organizations and government agencies. The concern is not only about the need to ensure the full participation of people with disabilities and health limitations in the life of society, but also about the identification and elimination of various forms of discrimination of any social group. The survey conducted in Kazan, Tomsk, and Saratov in the spring and summer of 2021 revealed the difficulties and reasons for the concern of the respondents. According to the data obtained, the greatest difficulties and concerns of the respondents are due to the inaccessibility of help and support and the sharp restriction of communication with loved ones. An important criterion for perceiving the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic was the respondents' illness experience. Personal experience determines the level of severity of perception of the coronavirus and the consequences of its spread, as well as the mood for solidarity with others, even unfamiliar people, when they need help. Measures taken by the state and ways of support found by society during the pandemic can contribute to the further development of the inclusive agenda in all spheres of life.

DT Article
DE public administration effectiveness; monitoring; presidential cycles;
   public opinion
AB Since 2008, in the Editorial section of the journal, we have been monitoring the effectiveness of public administration; this helps us to analyze the consistent steps that the President makes in order to build new foundations of the Russian statehood, which was, in fact, completely destroyed in 1991. Besides, we assess the effectiveness of the President's decisions from the point of view of the broad strata of the Russian population (voters), whose opinion is one of the main criteria for the effectiveness of the public administration system and the work of the head of state. In order to form an objective and unbiased view of the events and processes taking place in Russia and abroad, we use assessments obtained from a wide range of specialists in various fields: political analysts, economists, sociologists, philosophers, representatives of civil society. No less important is our regular access to a significant number of statistical, sociological, Russian and foreign databases; by using them comprehensively, we can look at the situation in the country and assess the effectiveness of public administration from the point of view of not only individual experts, but also voters. The main information source of sociological data in our research is the public opinion monitoring that we have been conducting in the Vologda Oblast since 1996. Regularly, once every two months, we carry out a survey covering 1.5 thousand residents of the region, thus obtaining an average annual "cross-section" of public opinion based on the estimates of nine thousand voters representing the main social strata and groups that differ in income, territory of residence, employment, marital status, education and many other socio- demographic characteristics. Due to a monitoring nature of the research, we can observe how, in the course of time, the events and decisions taken by the head of state are lined up in a clear, consistent, logically verified line, which many experts can see. But the majority of voters who observe "with the naked eye" the situation in the country and the actions of the authorities, do not see this line, because it is perceived on a subconscious and routine level, that is, based on the general opinion prevailing in their environment and stereotypes that people develop through their own life experience, the experience of relatives and friends (including negative life experience of the 1990s). This is why our editorial articles often supplement the analysis of latest events and processes in Russia and abroad with a retrospective look at the management decisions that preceded them. We pay special attention to the principle of historicism, and in this regard it is important for us to build a chronology of events. The current article is the last one in 2021; it briefly summarizes the analysis of public administration effectiveness in the context of Vladimir Putin's presidential terms, with an emphasis on the first four years of the fourth presidential cycle (2018-2021).

DE Syrian conflict; Russian media; framing; information field
ID COVERAGE
AB The article analyzes features of the coverage of the Syrian conflict by the Russian media. Empirically, the study is based on the articles published in 2015-2019 in the most cited federal media resources - the online edition of RIA Novosti, as well as the newspapers Izvestia and Vedomosti. The authors employ the method of the qualitative content analysis in the MAXQDA program. Given the extremely important role that framing plays in media resources, the authors focused on identifying key frames of coverage of the events in Syria, which allowed them to trace the main trends in presenting these events, as well as document technologies and techniques used by the media to create political images related to the Syrian crisis. The research study showed that the collective frame of the Syrian conflict in the Russian media has the following features: (1) emphasis on the diplomatic component to the detriment of the military one; (b) demonization of the United States; (3) ignoring causes of the conflict; (4) anti-terrorism rhetoric. Two technologies were actively used in framing - the technology of fragmenting information, which prevents the formation of a general picture of what is going on, and the technology of attention distraction aimed at playing down coverage of the controversial events, which violates the integrity of the frame by focusing on relatively insignificant and obvious events.
   According to the authors' conclusion, despite all the efforts of the federal media, the Syrian operation of Russia failed to become a "small victorious war" that would provide a wave of patriotic mobilization in the country. With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the Syrian crisis has actually disappeared from the media agenda and is unlikely to make any significant contribution to changing the Russian information field in the future.

AB The research into the settlements on the Tarkhankut peninsula is the most relevant issue of the Crimean Bronze Age. More than forty new Bronze Age settlements have been discovered by means of complex interdisciplinary methods (analysis of satellite imagery, GPS routes for land exploration, magnetic and electromagnetic surveys, excavations). Oval structures were found on more than twenty new sites using non-invasive methods. By ethnographic similarities, they were interpreted as "livestock corrals" with stone foundations of walls. To test this hypothesis and to identify the time of existence, four settlements were excavated. It has been found that some settlements were repeatedly populated. Basic archaeological material and radiocarbon dating show that two settlements (Tarkhankut-18 and Tarkhankut-22a) existed in the final period of the Middle Bronze Age. They were left by communities of Babino culture. Based on the data of geochemical analysis of soil samples taken at a test pit 1 at Tarkhankut-18 settlement, the main function of this part can be defined as livestock enclosure-corral. Two other settlements existed in the Late Bronze Age. They were left by communities of Sabatinovka (Tarkhankut-H2) and Belozerka (Tarkhankut-H8) cultures. "Livestock corrals" are very close to structures unearthed on the sites of Hospital II and Gorodishche 11 km, which date to the Middle Bronze Age and are attributed to Kamensk culture of eastern Crimea. The structures of the Middle and Late Bronze Age found in Crimea are similar to synchronous objects from the Circumpontic region. It is indicative of the existence of specific non-burial stone architecture in the world of moving herders.

AB News media tend to reflect voices in the political establishment while covering international events. Is it still true when almost half of the national audience speak the language of the country featured in the coverage? In this paper, we present an analysis of 19.5k news messages collected from Russian-language Ukrainian news outlets covering the 2018 presidential elections in Russia. Using a mixed-method approach (topic modeling and qualitative reading), we identify key topics and stories and evaluate the extent of personalization in the election coverage. We find three central angles: the focus on polls and election results, election preparations in Crimea, and Vladimir Putin's victory. The elections are linked predominantly to Crimean issues through the date of the elections, each candidate's stance on the subject, the election management in the region, and other countries' reactions to the results. Such coverage has an accusatory bias; it stresses the legal status of the Crimean referendum and the Russian authorities' actions and reports the pressures on locals by authorities, especially the Crimean Tatars. Not linked directly to Crimea, other angles are less emotionally charged. Political personalization of the discussion has a contradictory nature. On one hand, the overwhelming majority of the messages mention public figures. On the other hand, the coverage of the figures is limited and omits their traits. Moreover, at times, public figures are replaced by non-personalized symbols (e.g., Kremlin, Russian invaders). However, if the former's coverage is predominantly neutral, the latter's coverage is more prone to negative and loaded statements.

The estimation of the scale and the way to overcome corruption is based on the data of international organizations and experts. The article shows a gradual tightening of the CPV-SRV leadership's policy in this sphere, including trials of certain high-rank corrupters, the ban on leaving the country for party officials suspected in corruption etc. The anticorruption content of relevant official resolutions has been emphasized. As a whole, the efforts being undertaken have been assessed positively jointly with the conclusion that corruption in the Vietnamese society has become the challenge for the ruling party, the challenge which the party cannot combat efficiently, so far.

AB The author believes that his article is relevant because it explores new forms of non-political radical ideas on the Russian Internet. The object of the research is the main manifestations of non-political activity of a destructive orientation. Its aim is to classify and determine the degree of social harmfulness of this activity. The author employed methods of both empirical and theoretical analysis. The theoretical methods were category-criterion analysis, critical discourse analysis, typological analysis, complex-procedural and comparative psychological methods. The empirical methods were the collection of material using general and special search programs and an information retrieval thesaurus, and the analysis of textual material and products of communication. First, the author developed a set of criteria for identifying non-political radical Internet communities. As a result, the author received a large array of empirical information, which he then ordered and conceptualized according to previously developed criteria. The novelty of the research consists in the development of criteria and a classification of the scantily explored forms of non-political radicalism in the Russian Internet. The author developed a category-criterion apparatus for identifying Internet communities that can be classified as "hate groups", identified the addresses of their Internet distribution, and, finally, determined the scale of social harmfulness of such communities. The author hopes that the materials of the article may be of interest to social scientists and governmental managers, as well as to specialists in security problems.

AB The paper reconstructs the life of Isidor Borisovich Rumer (1884-1938), a member the Rumer family, then based in Moscow. His biography has been considered in the context of the relationship between the Russian intelligentsia and Soviet authorities. The focus is on the characteristics of the repressive policy pursued against intelligentsia in the pre-war period, especially in the 1930s. It was the time of irreversible change in the economic, political and cultural policy implemented by the Soviet Union. This involved imposing the sole ideology and command-and-control approaches to science and culture institutions, and the state becoming the only manager of all property. Dissent was suppressed by mass repression against the real and perceived opponents. Among them were representatives of national intelligentsia, artists, scientists and engineers, most of whom were not implacable opponents of the Soviet power. Their critical attitude was, as a rule, latent and reflected the mindset of intellectuals and humanists. They voiced their opinion only among the people sharing their ideas and views. The author has studied appropriate archives and publications and made an attempt to get insight into the phenomenon of national intelligentsia.

Despite long-held interest of the Russian historiography in the problems of imperial bureaucracy, the human capital of management apparatus in the regional outskirts remains outside the focus of researchers' attention. Issues of the discourse managers/managed are important for study, since their mutual perception affected the achievement of the main goal of the state, which was to integrate the imperial outskirts into the Russian space, and as its many aspects remain relevant even at the present stage. The sources are materials from the fonds of the State Archive of the Stavropol Krai (GASK) and the National Archive of the Republic of Kalmykia (NARK), containing personal data of civil servants and office documentation. The concept of "management" is considered as a process during which the subject of management, that is, managers (in this case officials of the inorodtsy directorates), affects the object of management - managed - nomadic peoples. Using comprehensive methods of content analysis of archival sources texts and reconstruction of events in chronological sequence, the main directions of interaction between the managers and the managed have been determined. The author concludes that the process of mutual perception of the managers and the managed on the inorodtsy outskirts of the empire was one of significant aspects in the context of formation of the mechanism for their integration into the all-Russian socio-economic and political-legal space, which showcases the political course of the central authorities in relation to the local population. In the course of direct interaction between the two, both positive and negative directions were developed, the latter, to the extent possible, were alleviated by the higher regional management, who, unlike middle-level officials, were fully aware of the goals and tasks of the inorodtsy directorates.

AB Considering the current ecological situation in the modern world, the quality of life depends not so much on a stable energy supply as on an environmentally friendly way of producing and consuming energy, which has turned social and research attention to the opportunities of renewable energy systems (RES). In spite of the vital necessity of transitioning to environmentally friendly energy production, the implementation and development of renewable energy technologies face a range of barriers: socio-cultural, technological, economic, institutional and environmental. To overcome these barriers, the authors of this article use the systems approach to gain deeper understanding of RES interconnection and interdependence. They apply STEEP analysis for classification and qualitative analysis of RES development barriers in Russia. The article proposes the analytical methodology, which reveals system specifications of the national RES development barriers and predicts the chain reaction of overcoming particular barriers. Using this methodology, the authors identify the main socio-cultural roots of RES development barriers in Russia: state control of the development of the energy sector, the political stake in hydrocarbons and the lack of consistent policies on RES development. The authors' suggested analysis methodology is appropriate for identifying the root problems in energy socio-economic systems and for effective decision-making process in the energy sector.

AB The article examines some of the key features of the scientific work of Douglass North. It is argued that the popular image of North as an adherent of this or that school of economic thought is not highly relevant. The authors believe that one of the key features of North's research style is his "theory-centricity". The article demonstrates that the most important milestones in North's career (fling with Marxism in his youth, participation in the Cliometrics revolution, the transition from neoclassical economist to one of the founders of neo-institutionalism, a turn towards cognitive science), despite the seeming lack of continuity served as kind of steps of the ladder along which North went to the creation of a comprehensive theory of social development. Based on the results of qualitative content analysis of North's works of the 1950s and 60s, the authors show that even in the years of his affinity for quantitative economic history, the economist always put the ability to theorize above the skills of quantitative analysis. This feature, combined with the recent empirical turn in economics, which raised the prestige of empirical work to unprecedented heights, made it difficult for modern mainstream economists to perceive the ideas of the "late" North. The authors' analysis of the citation structure of North's last major book, "Violence and Social Orders. Conceptual framework for the interpretation of the written history of mankind" confirms this trend. This book generates greater interest among heterodox economists, historians, and political scientists than among representatives of mainstream economics. In the article's conclusion, the authors speculate about the prospects of the Northian theory driven style of doing economic research in the face of the progressive "empirization" of modern economics.

AB The article focuses on analyzing the changes that have occurred in the procedures for assessing scientific knowledge during the period of their massive introduction into the economy, politics and everyday life, as well as the formation of a new social position of the expert. Up to this point, the assessment of scientific knowledge often took place within the scientific community. In that case, a special role was played by "authority" able to evaluate projects basing on criteria intrinsic to the scientific ethos. The active introduction of scientific knowledge into the social life encouraged the emergence of a new expert's social position differing from an intrascientific "authority". In their work, they have to evaluate projects that involve large financial resources and contribute to changes in social and economic life, and therefore, in addition to scientific criteria, such experts consider any possible economic, political and social consequences of the project implementation. Along with it, the formation of the new expert's social position and its active use by scientists leads to several problems. First, the expertise and expert practices are beginning to be used by scientists to legitimize their own position in science and fight rival groups. Second, these processes can provoke a decrease in diversity both within science itself and in the number of cognitive practices; also they can limit the emergence of new approaches to the analysis of technological, economic, political and social innovations.

AB In China, the topics of pandemic and economic recovery gradually lose their importance and give place to another deterioration in U.S.-China relations due to pressure from the United States on Hong Kong, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, and the insufficient, according to the American side, pace of implementation of China's first phase of commercial transactions with the United States. Beijing takes Washington's threats to deprive Hong Kong of the status of a special customs territory in trade and economic cooperation with the U.S. quite seriously. However, Chinese experts note that the implementation of these threats will not lead to the collapse of the Hong Kong economy, since the most-favored-nation regime applies to about 5% of Hong Kong's exports to the United States. At the same time, Beijing is trying to find an alternative to Hong Kong as a financial center in the face of Macao. However, the main characteristics of the Macao economy do not yet allow us to seriously talk about a full-fledged replacement, since most of the GDP of this special administrative region is formed by the gaming, tourism and restaurant industries. To a certain extent, the "position" of Hong Kong is claimed by Shanghai, but the extent of its claims is limited by the Chinese legal system, which is less flexible and liberal than that of Hong Kong. In May 2020, the so-called "Two sessions" were held in Beijing: the national Committee of the People's Political Consultative Council of China (CPPCC) and the National People's Congress (NPC). The latter presented a report on the government's work in 2019 and the first quarters of 2020. The report contains the main guidelines and targets for the country's socio-economic development for the current year, as well as a list of measures to support the economy in the so-called "post-crisis" period. Most of the mechanisms for stimulating growth are of a fiscal nature: the authorities do not want to inflate the amount of debt owed by public and private companies too much, and they go, first of all, for tax breaks. At the same time, the Central budget deficit is expected to increase to 3.6% due to reduced tax revenues because of quarantine measures and increased government spending to support consumer demand. At the same time, Beijing announced a reduction in spending by the central and provincial governments on "unimportant" and "non-priority items": construction of buildings, business trips, celebrations, etc. The report on the government's work reflected the desire of the Chinese leadership to accelerate the ongoing work on "launching" a new economic model of China's development, aimed not at achieving high growth rates, but at quality indicators. For the first time, the NPC session did not specify the expected GDP growth rate in 2020. However, the main characteristics of this model have not yet been fully clarified. In the first approximation, it is a bet on the production of high-tech products, the implementation of traditional infrastructure projects within China and the expansion of domestic consumption - while maintaining the strategy of going outside in the format of the "Belt and Road" (or the "Silk Road Economic Belt"). The so-called "separation" of China and the United States in the financial and economic spheres, which is widely discussed in the world press, has not yet taken place. D. Trump's "return of American business to the United States" is not yet perceived by the American private business itself, which is interested in expanding its presence in Chinese financial and other markets.
   China, for its part, by opening previously closed sectors of its economy is trying to provide new business opportunities to American companies in a "compromise" way, in contrast to military and political issues, where Beijing acts extremely harshly. In Russian-Chinese relations, there is still a trend to deepen strategic partnership in the military-political sphere and, if possible, in the economy taking into account the negative consequences of the pandemic and adjusting for the scale of the Russian economy.

AB In the given article, the author offers an interpretation of the work titled Lacedaimonion Politeia, written by the ancient political philosopher Xenophon of Athens. Judging from Xenophon's sober and open-minded attitude to the regime he researches, the author focuses on the central issue of the treatise, namely, the upbringing of a virtuous or good citizen. This became the cornerstone of Sparta's success as a polis, and provided it with a fame as a unique political entity praised by all, but copied by none. The author identifies the three stages of the Spartan education given by Xenophon and continues with the practices of its implementation at a mature age. The research makes it clear that the purpose of the laws of Lycurgus, as described by Xenophon, is twofold. On the one hand, the given laws instill respect, obedience, and the virtue of manliness which the lawgiver desired in citizens. On the other hand, the laws create citizens who merely imitate the above- described traits of character and law-abidance, and who are actually more like unmitigated criminals constantly fighting with each other. It is the second type of people-good criminals-who find themselves in power in Sparta, and they are the ones who end up destroying the Spartan state. By providing this diagnosis of the Spartan regime and the laws of Lycurgus, Xenophon attempts to show that handling the problem of the education of good citizens as suggested in Sparta is misguided and requires additional deliberation.

AB The article examines the history of the theory of Ordoliberalism in the context of plans for the post-war economic reconstruction of Germany. These plans were developed within the Reich ministries and other authorities in cooperation with representatives of German economic science from 1939 to 1945. The paper presents little-known aspects of the applied scientific activities of a group of Freiburg professors, founders of ordoliberal teaching, primarily Walter Eucken and Franz Boehm, who are traditionally considered to be the main figures of academic and intellectual opposition to the Nazi regime in the Third Reich. This article shows the characteristics of an academic expert cooperation of German political economists with state authorities, primarily with the Reich Ministry of Economics, as well as in the Academy of German Law, in particular, in its department - the research group "Political Economy" of the Class IV "On the Study of the National Economy", and after its official dissolution in 1943 within one of the non-official "Freiburg circles", the "Erwin von Beckerath Working group". Particular attention is paid to the problems and contradictions of the creation of a "new national socialist economic science", failed attempts to popularize the idea of transition to a market-oriented model of the military economy of Freiburg extraordinary professor Adolf Lampe, as well as to the concept of post-war reconstruction of the German economy by the authoritative Nazi official Otto Ohlendorf. Finally, an attempt is made to trace the continuity of German ideas about the politics of order between 1930 and 1940s, and to formulate preliminary remarks on the discussion on the relationship between the theory of German ordoliberalism and the economic views of some authorized senior ministerial officials in the Third Reich.

AB The problem of elderly people's activity is actualized by changes in the age structure of the population and the changed way of life determined by the capabilities of modern society. These trends lead to the question of new social policy strategies. The issue of the activity of the elderly living in a large city requires a separate consideration. The elderly do not fully use the opportunities of the city, and their activity is rather suppressed by an aggressive environment. This hypothesis is confirmed by a study conducted in 2019 in Novosibirsk (n = 670). The aim of the study was to identify the characteristics of the three groups of elderly people: 1) the elderly who are on home-based care; 2) the elderly who are not on home-based care, but receive social services more or less regularly in social institutions; 3) the elderly who do not apply or rarely apply to social institutions. The assumption that each of the selected groups has a common level of activity associated with state of health (well-being) - low, medium and high - was confirmed. The third group tries not to fall out of modern culture, recognizes new social practices and has a wide range of needs. The activity of the other two groups is significantly limited; moreover, the group of those who periodically apply to social institutions raises concerns due to the rapid loss of social ties and exclusion from new social practices. Retirement is an objective factor in reducing activity. While 65% are calm about the new status or perceive it as inevitable, the activity of 16% may change as a result of the frustration experienced. Despite the positive reaction, the feeling of cheerfulness is more or less often experienced by only 7% of the elderly living in the city, while a quarter of the elderly experience problems with well-being (health), and 19% feel bad. The study showed that, most likely, only 35% of the elderly can be considered active, having the strength "for doing something", while the elderly's assessment of well-being (state of health) was more positive than the self-assessment of the potential for activity. Elderly people in the city often find themselves alone; their knowledge of information technology is unsatisfactory and does not allow restoring communications. The territory (microdistrict, yard) is not adapted to support the activity of the elderly, and social activity practices are more desirable than real. At the same time, there

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to the identification and analysis of the dominant trends in the transformation of forms and technologies of communication used by the government and Russian society institutions in the context of the COVID-19 spread. The attention is focused on the characteristics of socio-political factors that determine the level of trust/distrust of citizens and representatives of various social groups to intentions and actions of the authorities and administration at the federal, regional and municipal levels in the Russian Federation to overcome the consequences of the global pandemic in the process of communication. Methods. The communicative practices of public and civil institutions are revealed in the context of interpreting the specifics of the existing public space and public policy of modern Russia. The theoretical and methodological basis of the research are the political-communicative and action-activist approaches, the spatial dimension of political processes principles, which make it possible to rely on the systemic vision of the information and discursive, practical and management elements of the multidimensional concept of public policy. The work uses the methods of political comparative studies, forecasting, interpretation of empirical data obtained by leading Russian and foreign research centers, as well as by the authors in the framework of their grant research. Results. An attempt was made to conduct political analysis of the dominant negative and positive factors revealing the specifics of the COVID-19 spread in the Russian Federation from the point of view of the everyday practices of modern Russian society and the consolidated institutional system of public administration. The authors trace the link between the situation of uncertainty resulting from the spread of the global threat, the desire to ensure international and national security, as well as the transformation of forms and technologies of communication between citizens, public institutions, the state. The real and potential resources of communication between society and the authorities for building an effective system to minimize the negative consequences of the pandemic for representatives of various socio-demographic, professional, and status-role groups, that are included in the structures of discussion, decision-making and implementation, are highlighted. The results of theoretical and empirical studies revealing a public opinion on the impact of COVID-19 on the socio-political process in modern Russia are interpreted. Discussion. The question of the forms and technologies of communication between the actors of modern public policy in the significant decisions making process in the context of strengthening destructive factors and the institutionalization of a "riskgenerating" society remains poorly studied.

   organizations; strategy; factor model; rural areas; ecosystem resilience
AB Political, economic and social events of recent years, taking place in all of the countries, when economic institutions and systems are destroyed in a short time under the influence of negative external factors, indicate the need to create resilient socio-economic territorial systems. This problem is essential to rural areas that are most vulnerable to negative external impacts, which confirms the relevance of finding ways and directions to ensure their sustainable development. Our previous research has shown that the formation of an entrepreneurial ecosystem of rural areas, substantiating the institutions of their development, can ensure sustainability of socio-economic development of rural areas and increase their resilience. The article proposes a model for building strategies for the development of entrepreneurial organizations within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, aimed at ensuring sustainable socio-economic development of rural areas and increasing the competitive environment of the ecosystem. The purpose of the article is to develop a factor model for building entrepreneurial strategies of entrepreneurial organizations that adequately meet the role of the rural entrepreneurial ecosystem in the current conditions of development of Russian rural areas. The strategic development concept is usually applied in the analysis of large corporate organizations. It is believed that small businesses, exposed to external factors, must use adaptive tactics and cannot formulate and implement a strategy for their development. Based on the analysis of scientific literature and the results of a survey of entrepreneurs on the example of the Sverdlovsk Oblast of the Russian Federation, we found that rural entrepreneurs seek to determine strategic directions of their development. The article presents approaches to the disclosure of relevant factors that determine the model for choosing a development strategy for rural entrepreneurial organizations. The information base of the study includes research works of Russian and foreign scientists on the topic under consideration, as well as the results of a thematic survey. The scientific novelty of the work lies in the fact that for the first time an attempt has been made to build a factor model for strategic development of rural entrepreneurs within the concept of entrepreneurial ecosystem of rural areas.

DE cultural and historical epistemology; truth; objectivity; scientific

AB Cultural and historical epistemology is not only a special branch of philosophical researches of science, but also the base of reform of a system of the epistemological categories expressing the purposes and values of scientific knowledge. Its need follows from the nature of development of modern science. Preservation of the traditional epistemological categories applied to the analysis of this development results in rough relativism. This danger can be eliminated, having developed the holistic system of epistemological values proceeding from the principle of historicism and "collective" understanding of the subject of scientific knowledge. Both of these bases allow to disclose historical and cultural conditionality of processes of scientific research and broadcast of their results. Such purposes and values of science as the truth and the objectivity of knowledge have historical measurement: they exist only in the course of continuous emergence and destruction, being affected by cultural factors. The collectivity of the subject of scientific knowledge is defined together with concepts of a "transcendental" and "individual and empirical" subject according to the principle of complementarity (N. Bohr) finding an epistemological transcription. The possibilities of political subjectivity of science in connection with the epistemological investigations from participation of scientific communities in political structures and movements are considered.

AB Social solidarity is viewed as a set of social ties, political relations and spiritual bonds that ensure the social integrity. It helps citizens to realize commonality of their historical destiny, their collective 'WE', to provide respectful relations to social norm, to develop skills and abilities of joint activities and mutual assistance. The article analyses the nature and level of the Russian students' involvement in social solidarity ties. At the cognitive level the students'are able to identify Russia as a country to which they are tied by the formal relations of citizenship. However, only two-thirds of the respondents are able to feel their identity with the Russian people, to say 'it is us' about themselves and Russian citizens, and a little more than half of them feel proud for their country. The students tend to be wary when dealing with people outside the circle of their family and friends. However, it does not prevent them from showing tolerance to people of different nationalities, religions, ways of living and wealth. They demonstrate a willingness to help disadvantaged people who need help; every third respondent participated in the volunteer movements. They are aware that the cohabitation is possible only if everyone follows requirements established by law, but at the same time every third respondent confirms that it is impossible to live in Russia without breaking laws. A certain part of students combines tolerant attitude towards members of other social groups with intransigence towards political opponents. One of four speaks of demonstrative unwillingness to even listen to the arguments of political opponents, and only one in eleven shows willingness to correct his/her views 'if the opponent's arguments prove convincing'. When political maximalism is combined with a critical attitude towards government institutions (every third or fourth student does not trust government bodies), then the dialogue between the authorities and those who are from the very outset not ready to listen to arguments of the other side becomes highly problematic. It explains the willingness of more than a quarter of students to take part in protest actions. Our research shows that in the student environment the most fragile ties are the vertical solidarity ones that connect citizens through their attitude to the state and its policies. Their fragility is manifested both in the level of trust in government institutions and in the feeling that the country is moving in the wrong direction. This trend can be partly explained by specific information environment that affects students' thinking. A main source of information about the events in the country and in the world for the vast majority of students is social networks. But, apparently, there are other, deeper reasons related to the deepening gap between the expectations of young people and the assessment of the real opportunities that are opening up for them in the country.

DE Special Care Institutions; Media Discourse; Critical Discourse Analysis;

ID POLITICAL CORRECTNESS
AB Special care (psychoneurological) institutions for people with disabilities have started to draw more public attention in Russia. Some public organizations categorically oppose such asylums and produce TV reports investigating the way people are treated there and picturing these institutions as "prisons" for the innocent. Even though journalists and authorities are now forced to take more progressive ideologies into account, the discourse supporting the system of such institutions continues to be reproduced. The study aims to analyze modern discourses about such institutions and people who are isolated there. The data comprise seventeen video reports from 2012-2020. The main method is critical discourse analysis, with a particular focus on labeling people (229 cases). The main justifications behind the discourse supporting the system of special care institutions are: care about "the disadvantaged" and "the souls suffering from diseases"; "protecting" those who cannot live on their own; their "uniqueness" (which, being seemingly more politically correct, justifies isolation). The discourse opposing the system of asylums is backed and enacted by representatives of nongovernmental organizations and experts arguing that isolated people are often not ill, and shows successful "alumni" who have managed to escape from the "prison." The rote of the "patients" in nearly all analyzed video reports is limited to providing short answers or being in the background, and all reports reproduce the paternalistic ideology toward isolated people, albeit to different extents. The recent years can be described as a transition period when both discourses coexist, along with compromise outlooks on the residential care institutions.

ID SOCIOLOGY
AB Since the 19th century, when the development of the 'modem society' accelerated, social cohesion factors have become relevant for theory and practice. Such issues as the national states' development and emerging political parties, the division of labor and class and professional forms of solidarity have formed the agenda of both academic and policymaking debates. In recent decades, there has been another round of interest in the study of social cohesion and sustainability under de-colonization, emancipation, inequality and technological changes. Under the global pandemic, the issue of solidarity has become particularly acute. The covid-19 has created a new reality: millions of people live in the forced social isolation, and such key social institutions as education, culture and healthcare have been reconstructed with the usual forms of interpersonal interaction eliminated. This situation requires rethinking the rights and obligations of individuals together with the forms of appropriate social control and regulation. For instance, the ability of individuals to take initiative at the micro-level (like volunteer projects) turned out to be especially important for the public well-being. The authors consider the research on solidarity in social sciences taking into account the current trends of structural instability or 'destructuration'. The authors analyze both classical theories of solidarity and contemporary related concepts to prove that microsociology focuses primarily on the reproduction of social structures rather than on their transformation by proactive individual or group agency. Moreover, the tradition of structural macro-analysis also ignores the formation of solidarity at the micro-level. The authors refer to the works of P.A. Sorokin and M. Archer who consider individuals as capable of proactive formation of solidarity. In contemporary studies, the authors identify two main approaches to the analysis of solidarity - rational and structure-determined, and analyze other prospective approaches developing at the intersection of philosophy and psychology. The authors conclude by suggesting some directions in the study of the solidarity-oriented individual action and its impact on societal development.

AB Introduction. Population growth in the world is uneven: while in some countries the population has been growing for a long time ( China, India), in Russia and in many EU and BRIC countries, the birth rate has been declining in recent years; and if this does not affect the population, then only by increasing life expectancy and migration. Abrupt changes - both growth and decline - in the population are a threat to the national security of the state. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of political management (strategies and tools) aimed at solving demographic problems and increasing the birth rate in the Russian Federation, as well as to identify the stages of the formation of demographic policy in the Russian Federation in 1992-2019. Methods and materials. Based on the qualitative analysis of normative documents, the frame analysis of speeches of political leaders the main factors that influenced the coverage of demographic problems are revealed (the authors used official electronic versions of the following publications: "Sobranie Zakonodatelstva Rossiyskoy Federatsii" (Collection of Legislation of the Russian Federation) and "Byulleten normativnykh aktov federalnykh organov ispolnitelnoy vlasti" (Bulletin of Normative Acts of Federal Executive Authorities). Analysis. The proposed research strategy allowed identifying demographic threats to national security articulated by political actors and presented in official documents, statements of officials, as well as to compare the political decisions taken in the Russian Federation with the decisions taken in some European countries. Strategic documents that ensure national security of the Russian Federation by including the demographic agenda in political discourse are considered as a tool of political management. Results. The article assesses the effectiveness of political management in solving demographic problems and increasing the birth rate in the Russian Federation, identifies the stages of the formation of demographic policy in the Russian Federation in 1992-2019, as well as the features of the articulation of demographic problems in the political discourse of Russia, and describes demographic threats. The analysis of the regulatory framework as a tool for political management, demographic threats prevention, as well as the basis of the state strategy for increasing the birth rate in the Russian Federation allowed identifying policy decisions that can be used to develop new measures within the framework of programs to increase the birth rate in the Russian Federation.

TI THE FIRST QUARANTINE: HOW THE PLAGUE BECAME A POLITICAL DISEASE

AB The great plague of 1665-1666 is one of the starting points for the birth of biopolitics in its modern form. The quarantine measures introduced by the government have been considered effective from the medical point of view since the middle of the 18th century. However, many of those contemporary with the plague were convinced that the state was only worsening matters for London's inhabitants. The author examines why the plague elicited such an ambivalent response in England and how the disease stopped being a composite object and turned into a "comfortable, domesticated" concept. The article investigates why the moral assessment of those measures has become so different over the past hundred years and shows how the quarantine in London influenced the "hygienic revolution."
   Apart from its historical interest, this case is a suitable topic for the use of STS methodology because it illustrates the impossibility providing a complete description of the quarantine process and subsequent medical treatment in terms of a conflict between different actors. In order to understand why these measures have subsequently been perceived in this fashion, the author applies the concept of Lovecraftian horror, which offers a way to describe the situation of "collisions" with the plague. By describing how biopolitics released the moral tension built up by the co-existence of different interpretations of the causes of the epidemic, the author reconstructs the retrospective creation of the myth about the success of the quarantine. He contrasts the logic of "multiplicity" with the unifying descriptions and shows the kind of problems a "blurred" ontology can bring on during a crisis in everyday life. This leads to a discussion of the difficulty of holding onto unstable objects that have the potential for liberation from the logic of paternalistic care.

AB The article presents the results of a study of the political culture of youth in modern Russia on the example of Krasnoyarsk, a city with the population of one million people. The phenomenon of political culture was investigated using the orientational approach supplemented by an important behavioral component - the study of political behavior. Political culture began to be defined as a category that includes both orientations (feelings, sensations, knowledge, opinions, attitudes) and behavior (action or inaction). When defining civic consciousness in the political culture of young people, the authors focused on the study of two of its components - consciousness and behavior. The study of the political culture of modern youth from the point of view of the formation of civic (conscious and activist) behavior is due to the direct relationship of the problems of youth's socialization with the harmonious development of society, with its further socioeconomic and political prospects. The study made it possible to identify the type of the political consciousness of young people and the model of their behavior in politics. Young people today prefer social justice but are not ready to sacrifice their interests for the sake of the needs of society. The support of the value of individual freedom by the majority of the respondents demonstrates that at this age individualistic interests and the desire to be independent are great. This result also suggests that young people are reflecting on the sociopolitical situation in Russia and the world. The respondents today associate the importance of participation in social and political life with their existing civic duty. Taking into account that the most widespread form of participation in politics for young people is elections, we can assume that it is coming to the elections that young people consider as fulfillment of their civic duty. The study revealed the predominance of a conscious motive in the experience of political activity among young people engaged in work or study.

DT Article

AB Expanding the accessibility of space and the environment is one of the central tasks of social policy and public attention, strengthening equality and justice. At first glance, such a problem is primarily revealed in spatial metaphors, such as barriers, restrictions, access, borders. However, spatial logic allow us only partially to explain the phenomena of oppression and emancipation, inclusion and exclusion. The social model allows us to map and identify the disabling contours of the spatial environment, but underestimates the patterns of oppression produced by temporal factors. The article reveals the cognitive possibilities of the temporal turn in studies of the accessibility of the urban environment for people with disabilities. The analysis is based on qualitative interviews in four Russian cities with activists from among people with disabilities. The authors consider the opinions of informants about how relations with social and physical environment evolve over the years, and what changes occur in the moments of everyday interaction. We are talking about such macrostructural characteristics of temporality as age, season, obsolescence and updating of technologies, changes of political priorities. Other modes of temporality are the changes in social attitudes, the intensity of collective actions, the transformation of the perception of accessible environment. The prospect of everyday temporality is revealed at the micro level of social interactions, in which the rhythms of urban life are violated and reconfigured, subjectivity is revealed, and acts of exclusion and inclusion occur. People with disabilities, our contemporaries and interlocutors, in their narratives, revealed the connection between moments of time and social phenomena and processes, reflected the changes occurring in themselves and the environment in the processes of their interactions.

AB Offering employment in the public sector in exchange for electoral support (patronage politics) and vote-buying are clientelistic practices frequently used by political machines. In the literature, these practices are typically studied in isolation. In this paper, we study how the interaction between these two practices (as opposed to having just one tool) affects economic development. We present a theoretical model of political competition, where, before the election, the incumbent chooses the level of state investment that can improve productivity in the private sector. This decision affects the income levels of employees in the private sector, and, thereby, the costs and effectiveness of vote-buying and patronage. We show that when the politician can use both clientelistic instruments simultaneously, his opportunity cost for clientelism in terms of foregone future taxes declines. As a result, the equilibrium amount of public investment is typically lower when both tools are available than otherwise.

AB Purpose The paper aims to reveal the attitude of the Russian competition authorities towards cross-border mergers involving foreign buyers. The study addresses the following question: Is the probability of Russian competition authorities' intervention significantly different when a foreign buyer takes part in the merger? This is the key test to reveal whether competition authorities gravitate towards "economic nationalism" or "promotion of foreign investments". Design/methodology/approach The discrete choice model is applied to the dataset of 7,607 merger cases investigated by the Russian competition authorities between 2012 and 2017. The probability of competition authorities' intervention, such as merger correction by using remedies or deal rejection, is used as a measure of special attention. Findings The study finds out favoritism patterns of the regulator with regard to foreign companies. In particular, the deals involving a foreign buyer had less chance of intervention, i.e. imposition of remedies, from national competition authorities. The sanctions period does not moderate the probability of approval of a cross-border merger with foreign buyers by the Russian competition authorities. Originality/value The paper contributes to merger control literature by addressing the political economy issues. It discovers that, besides regulation by the law, there are hidden motives, such as protectionism or favoritism of foreign companies, which could drive the regulator's decision. Therefore, the studies of cross-border mergers provide an opportunity to investigate the political issues of merger control through the identification of a special attitude to foreign companies and analysis of regularities that might explain such a policy.

TI FACELESS LEADERSHIP OF AMERICAN PUBLIC DIPLOMACY: HR CRISIS IN THE

DT Article
DE public diplomacy; soft power; USA; world order; global leadership; HR

AB This article focuses on workforce policies trends in the American public diplomacy institutions. The author compares tendencies regarding HR policy, e.g. frequency of leadership change, length of timespans between nominations, the ratio of acting and confirmed nominees during the age of the United Stated Information Agency (USIA) and after its disbandment in 1999. Comparison demonstrates a considerable change of patterns: since 1999, persons in charge of the American public diplomacy institutions have been rotating more often, and positions themselves stayed vacant longer than they did in the 20th century. There have been many acting nominees during the past decade, whereas in the time of the USIA there has been none. In addition, the article studies characteristics of both the USIA directors and Under Secretaries of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. The analysis of education, professional background, personal relationship with the U.S. President (or the lack of it) demonstrated that standards for the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs position applicants are significantly lower than the ones that were applied to candidates for the directorship of the USIA. With the results obtained, the author arrived to a conclusion that the change of HR policy in the American public diplomacy sphere indicates the lack of interest in the particular dimension of foreign policy among the political leadership of the U.S. in comparison to the age of the Cold War. This conclusion agrees with the fact that since 1990s, the American public diplomacy remains in crisis: no major reforms of institutions since 1999, unsuccessful attempts to develop a comprehensive strategic document for public diplomacy, frequent piques of anti-Americanism in the international public opinion in the 21st century. The article argues that the absence of a prominent leader in the American public diplomacy who would have stayed in the office for considerable amount of time, been a confidant of the President and thus an active participant of the formation of a national political vision, possessed outstanding professional experience, is both the consequence of the crisis in the U.S. public diplomacy and the factor that contributes to this crisis remaining unsolved.

AB Having emerged in a global world with its high cross-border population mobility, the COVID-19 pandemic could not but affect the basic characteristics of this process. Almost everywhere, partial or complete restrictions on movements between countries and within individual nations have been recognized as one of the most effective means of combating the spread of the infection. This resulted in a broad blocking of tourist flows and business trips, as well as in the increased difficulties of students studying abroad and the serious reduction of labour mobility. The problems associated with the need to regulate migration flows in emergency conditions are considered in the article using the example of two - at first glance different, but in fact clearly overlapping - country cases. The selection of Italy and Sweden is not accidental. These nations have demonstrated both similarities and differences in the objective circumstances and subjective factors that determined their chosen strategies to combat the pandemic and the priorities of their migration policies. The deep differences in socio-cultural traditions and the dissimilarity of these strategies between the two countries are reflected, in particular, in the divergent impact of COVID-19 and its consequences on social cohesion, weakening it in Italy and strengthening it in Sweden. The increased relevance of the problem of migration in the mass consciousness that associated with the coronavirus pandemic is fraught with the emergence and spread of erroneous stereotypes, philistine phobias, and conspiracy theories. This explains the revival of the tendency to strengthen the role of anti-immigrant populist and nationalist parties and movements, which may lead to a corresponding change in the configuration and balance of political forces.

AB Research on radicalization became relevant to the study of terrorism and violent extremism just two decades ago. The accumulated empirical data on terrorism have led researchers and experts to understand that radicalization is a predictor of violent actions by terrorists, violent extremists, and lone actors. Violent incidents committed by school shooters are not terrorist crimes, but there is good reasons for inclusion as terrorist crimes since they have similar mechanisms. The article aims to create a conceptual model of school-shooter radicalization and determine the distinguishing features of the process. The paper presents a theoretical and methodological base of content analysis concepts, political models, and terrorist radicalization on the different levels of study. Based on the content analysis results, we identify the significant gaps in the research field, consider the radicalization phenomenon in detail, substantiated the qualitative aspects of the school shooters radicalization, and propose a conceptual scheme. Psychological, behavioral, cognitive aspects of the school shooters radicalization reflect a holistic picture of the relationship between the process phases and changes in the parameters of the object's state. The aspects of radicalization and this phenomenon's qualitative properties are interpreted as the determinants of the conceptual model. The model includes five stages, each of which is considered to be one of the components for the formation and acceptance of the idea of a violent way to solve a problem, but certainly do not act individually as the only component that leads to the actual implementation of the incident of a school shooting. An in-depth study of online social connections and warning signs, mobilization factors, behavioral trajectories, and imitation mechanisms can help scientists understand why school shooters are increasingly motivated to use violent means to achieve personal goals. We have outlined the possibilities and prospects of the model's application and directions for future research.

TI SPAIN AT THE CROSSING TO THE STRESS-RESISTANT GROWTH MODEL
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Spain; the consequences of coronacrisis; the formation of a new
   development strategy; a resilient growth model; Russian-Spanish economic
   relations
AB The authors analyze the most significant changes taking place in the socio-economic sphere and in the field of international relations of Spain under the influence of recent crisis shocks. The focus is on the complex and contradictory process of forming a resilient (stress-resistant) growth model, which should determine the main vector of development of the Spanish state for the period up to 2050. For the first time in the national scientific literature the key components of the new model are comprehensively studied, and a predictive assessment of the areas of structural changes in the economy, social sphere and international policy of Spain is given. A special place is reserved for consideration of the current state and prospects of Russian-Spanish trade and economic relations. The article shows that the Spanish state, after several decades of progressive development, is in a state of escape from the maze of crisis shocks and another transitional period associated with the need for deep socio-economic transformations. In fact, we are talking about the formation of a new model of growth: instead of the paradigm of development established at the end of the last century, which rested on three "whales": construction and trade of real estate, accepting international tourism and priority trade and investment cooperation with partners in the European Union. In the face of largely unprecedented internal and external challenges, the Spanish State must adopt a new macroeconomic policy that takes into account the tectonic changes that have taken place (and continue to occur) in the modern world. The future of Spain and its place on the geoeconomic map depend on how the political leadership of the country, business and society as a whole will make a major transformation. Spanish socio-economic realities, interesting and significant as themselves, have an international sound and significance, as they closely correlate with the problems of a long number of countries in the world (including Russia, the states of southeastern Europe and Latin America) facing a similar challenge - the need to change the growth model. It is not so important whether their ruling circles are focused or not on this issue now, the need exists objectively and makes itself felt more and more every day.

TI India as a Global Power:The Strategic Culture Problems

DT Article
DE India; strategic culture; global strategy; great power; foreign policy;
   national interests; South Asia
AB The article reviews India's contested role of a great power in global politics. Although showing tangible results across all the aspects pertaining to the great power status, in international relations India is still largely underestimated and even overlooked. Politicians and scholars generally mention three main reasons behind that phenomenon: weak social and economic figures, the country's relatively narrow global impact the absence of strategic culture. We argue that the latter is key, and that it is in the process of being remedied. In fact, India already has all the prerequisites for being recognised as a 'great power', since it has political, military, economic and cultural capabilities corresponding to the status. It is simply a matter of time and coordinated efforts of the government to formulate and implement a consistent foreign policy and economic strategy as well as a change in Indian elite's strategic thinking which will enable untapping India's existing potential and successfully meeting the objective of increasing its influence in global politics.

TI THE WHITE WORKING CLASS AS TRUMP'S ELECTORATE BASE

LA Russian
DT Article
DE the white working class; Trump's electorate base; Republican Party;
   Democratic Party; trade globalization; automation of production; the
   American dream; the redneck; the confrontation of values' models;
   polarization
AB In 2020, the white working class made almost half of all the votes for Donald Trump - about 37 million out of 73.5 million votes that he got. 67% of white Americans with less than four years degree cast their votes for Trump. 100 days after he lost the reelection, 29% of Republicans believed that Trump will come back to the White House before the month of August 2021. Who are they, these Trumps supporters and believers? how did Trump change their role in political life, and what will be their future after him? During the last 45 years, the white working class of America has transformed from the world's most affluent and secure working class, the linchpin of the New Deal coalition, the protagonist of the American dream into one of the most vulnerable, disintegrated and declining in its number and power element of the American electorate. Trump used their anger and despair in his way to power, bringing them back to politics. Today both the Democratic and Republican Parties are fighting again for the white working class. Historically, this group was the base of the Democratic Party. But for the last two decades, the Party has become much more liberal in its values and focused more on dgerent groups of minorities. These trends made whites without college degree to shift to the Republican Party, regardless its "party of white riches" image. The current shift occurred in the years of Obama presidency - for highly conservative, less educated, mostly South whites this President came as a challenge to their traditional views of America. By the end of the Obama era, the Republican Party almost filled the gap with the Democratic Party in white working class support. Trump became the high pick of this shift. Meanwhile, the Democrats got the trend and came back fighting for its past electorate who suddenly became the focus of a political game and interparty transformations, which makes it highly possible to change the face of the American party system as we know today.

DT Article
DE revisionism; intervention; global governance; diplomacy; worldviews;
   political discourse
AB Russia's use of force in Ukraine has been described as a challenge to the rule of international law and an event of unilateral intervention. This paper provides a reinterpretation of this standard history of Russian revisionism. Our new history places this practice in a global governance context through an analysis of the politics concerning the international legal norm of `non-intervention' and its legitimate/illegitimate exceptions for collective intervention. This analysis discloses a practice of Russian diplomacy that emerges out of resistance to humanitarian interventions advocated for by Western states. This practice justifies its own state-bound humanitarian intervention as the legitimate exception to the foundation of international order, which Russian diplomacy had previously sought to restore. We argue the political discourse of the worldview of `state civilization' explains these events of Russian revisionism. We conclude with an analysis of the international paradoxes of peace and conflict contingent on this Russian worldview.

TI THE EUROPEAN MISSILE DEFENSE FACTOR IN RUSSIA-USA/NATO RELATIONS

DE U.S. missile defense; European Phased Adaptive Approach; European BMD;
   strategic stability; Aegis; Aegis Ashore; Mk-41 Vertical Launching
   System; Joint Data Exchange Center (JDEC)
AB The article analyses the issue of the NATO missile defense development and the evolution of views in the Russian political, military and expert circles. In 2009, the U.S. President Barack Obama declared a start of the NATO missile defense system construction with a goal to be able to intercept a limited nuclear strike from Iran. Russia is in doubt about the stated purpose of the European missile defense and considers it to be a threat to its own strategic nuclear forces. The European missile defense construction has been experiencing technical obstacles and political difficulties: the cancellation of deployment of interceptor SM-3 JIB and delays in establishing operational capability of the Aegis Ashore land-based missile defense system in Poland. The current architecture of the NATO missile defense, which allows only to intercept a limited number of incoming warheads, has no significant impact on Russian retaliatory strike capability. Nevertheless, the missile defense in Europe remains an irritating factor in relations between Russia and the USA. Apparently, Biden's arrival in the White House creates an opportunity for parties to address the issue during negotiations on the New START follow-on Treaty. The research addresses the history of Russia-USA-NATO cooperation on theatre missile defense and the reasons for the failure of the joint missile defense in Europe. The author justifies the reanimation of the Joint Data Exchange Center project and outlines the idea of its transformation to the Multilateral Data Exchange Center.

AB The author continues the study of the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the economic and political space of Germany. The second article outlines the features of the double transition. energy and digital. to a climate-neutral economy. Germany is carrying it out within the framework of the European Green Deal, the adoption of which almost coincided with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus crisis has become a catalyst for the transformation processes in the field of energy and digitalization, many of which Berlin began to implement long before the onset of its consequences. Lockdowns have led to a reduction in industry's primary energy and electricity consumption, motivated businesses to relocate employees to home-based work, and accelerate the introduction of new digital technologies. The coronavirus crisis has become a challenge for government departments, healthcare institutions, secondary and higher education, which management and employees were not ready for a quick use of distance technologies. The author analyzes the structural policy of the coalition government, the contribution of German-French initiatives and projects to the implementation of the double transition in the field of energy, cloud technologies and artificial intelligence, assesses the role of a new Climate Protection Law.

DE Germany; USA; EU; China; Russia; transatlantic relations; climate

AB This article addresses the most sign cant changes in German-American relations since the election of J. Biden; unveils the main factors influencing Berlin's transatlantic policy in relations with Russia and China; analyzes approaches to the climate agenda and problems associated with the fulfillment of Germany's allied obligations in NATO; reveals new trends in Germany's approach to the issue of strategic autonomy of the EU; investigates the discrepancies on security issues between the main German parties ahead of the parliamentary elections in September 2021. The first steps of the Biden administration to normalize the transatlantic ties undermined by Trump (the return of the United States to participation in international negotiations and organizations) were seen in Berlin as evidence of significant changes in Washington's positions on international problems of vital importance to Germany. At the same time, Berlin has no illusion that with the arrival of Biden, transatlantic relations will once again be the same as they were before Trump's presidency. The most important stumbling block in the beginning process of resetting the transatlantic relations was the set of problems associated with the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline construction. It is clear that Biden is just as harshly rejecting this project as his predecessor did, and will continue to obstruct its commissioning. After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2021, the internal political situation in Germany may change significantly. In any case, the Nord Stream 2 issue will remain a subject of disputes and serious disagreements between Germany, the USA, the EU and Russia for a long time. In Germany it is assumed that in the coming decades, the transatlantic agenda will be largely determined by the growing influence and policy of China, and the relationship between the United States and the EU with China will affect not only the economic interests of the FRG, but also the sphere of its security. The climate agenda today remains one of the few areas where it is possible not only to revive the transatlantic interaction, but also to intensify cooperation between the United States, the EU, China and Russia with an eye to interaction in solving other problems, not necessarily related to the climate agenda. The most important U.S. demand for Germany remains an increase in its material and financial contribution to NATO. Berlin's readiness to meet these requirements has increased significantly. However, the thesis that the Europeans are faced with a choice - a course towards strategic autonomy or restoration of close ties with Washington and reliance on the United States and NATO - seems simplified. Representatives of all Gelman parties are unanimous in the opinion that the renewal of the transatlantic partnership, which has begun under Biden, will be accompanied by a reduction in American commitments in Europe. Therefore, the EU will have to invest more in its own security and (in the longer term) strategic autonomy.

DE human rights; rule of law; values; European Union; China
AB The article presents a comparative interdisciplinary study of approaches to the problem of human rights in relations between the European Union and the People's Republic of China. This factor is traditionally used by the EU and the West to criticize the policies of other countries, combining pressure and encouragement in order to Westernize them. to accept and practicallyl implement the Western concept of human rights. However, modern China, having carried out rapid socio-economic and scientific-technological development, not only did not change its political system, but also began to reform the international sphere of human rights in accordance with their understanding. Ideological inertia and simplification of the problem do not contribute to understanding in Europe how, while retaining the socialist ideology, China became the second economy in the world, acquiring global primacy and promoting its model, without setting, like the West, special political conditions. At the same time, there are contradictions between the Western countries, and international law, including the field of human rights, which have a historical, dynamic character, and a very diverse implementation. In the socio-philosophical sense, the competition between the constructivist and functional approaches in the forms of the liberal-bourgeois and socialist systems is developing between the EU and the PRC.

AB With the use of the analytical works of the prominent Belgian researcher Sven Biscop, the article examines the main topics of discussion regarding changes in the global strategy of the European Union. EU foreign policy has been associated with the concept of "normative power", which is seen as a kind of European "soft power". Due to the influence of the global governance crisis, the COVID pandemic, the shift of USA geopolitical interests from Europe to Asia, China's great-power policy, Russia's geopolitical ambitions and other challenges, EU researchers and politicians are raising questions aimed at changing the strategic culture in order to ensure the primacy of EU vital interests. S. Biscop believes that while developing a new global strategy, it is necessary to turn to the traditions of geopolitics to be ready to protect interests and democratic values with the use of "hard power" both internally and externally. Strategic autonomy is a promising task for the further building of the EU. Under the instruction of the European Commission, the work has begun on the creation of a new political and strategic document "Strategic Compass", its goals include defining the EU targets in the field of security, defense, and identification of threats. The discussion of a new global strategy outlines a trajectory for the transformation of the European Union into a global "Third Pole". Sven Biscop's recommendations show that shaping a new global strategy will require a revision of the concept of "normative power" and turning closer to geopolitical realism.

DT Article
DE civic protest movements; sub-Saharan Africa; historical periods; street
   mobilization; conflict dynamics; electoral process; opposition parties
AB The study focuses on the civic protest movements (CPMs) in sub-Saharan Africa and analyzes three stages of their development, from the national liberation struggle of the 1950-1970s to establishment of national democratic institutions in the 1990s, to the 'third wave' of the activization coinciding with the beginning of the Arab Spring in 2011. Every period was characterized by different mobilization forms. Modern CPMs are driven mainly by urban youth who suffer from mass unemployment more than other age groups, while rural population remains relatively inert. Street mobilizations are led not by political figures or trade unionists (as it used to be during the period of anticolonial struggle), but by activists - representatives of the educated middle class and social network users who constantly keep in touch via Internet. They are fairly well-informed in all fields of life both in Africa and abroad, which gives them understanding of global inequality between African countries and advanced ones in terms of development of economy, medicine, education, as well as quality of living and life expectancy. Mobilization movements intend to demonstrate resentment towards the ruling circles' policies that are not aimed at improving people's lives and do not adhere to the principle of democratic rotation: rejuvenation of political elites and training alternative leaders. Protest movements are active in countries lacking public consensus, especially before and during presidential election campaigns. The article draws attention to the fact that, being predominantly political in nature, civic protest movements in this macrozone are becoming an important part of the political process and even result in changes of leadership (Senegal and Burkina Faso). Being inherently anti-system, they are organizationally unrelated with opposition parties, unions and their leaders. These movements are usually financed by Western foundations and international non-governmental organizations. One cannot exclude that these anti-system' movements will eventually transform into political parties, with their leaders turning into political actors.

DT Article
DE world oil market; "shale revolution"; US; Saudi Arabia; OPEC; OPEC+;
   Saudi Aramco
AB The goal of the article is to analyze the role of Saudi Arabia in the world oil market and in the world economy for a long historical period. It is shown that strategically behavior of Saudi Arabia always was and continues to be subordinated to ensuring the stable supply of oil into the world oil market. Under the Saudi Arabia leadership OPEC aims at pursuing an economically rational and responsible policy, supporting the balance of the demand for oil and its supply thus allowing to avoid deep and lasting oil price decline. Until the very recently an important factor impacting the formulation of Saudi oil policy was maintaining of strategic interaction with the US. The restructuring of the world oil market driven by the shale revolution and nearing peak of global demand for oil have created new challenges for Saudi Arabia oil strategy. The OPEC+ situational agreement enacted since 2017 by OPEC and non-OPEC countries to voluntary reduce levels of oil production temporarily allows to keep a supply - demand balance in the world oil market preventing from substantial drop in oil prices. At the same time the agreement opens opportunities for competitors, first of all American producers of tight oil, to maintain and expand export niches. Shale revolution created a situation when oil interests of the US and Saudi Arabia came into open conflict. For political and strategic considerations, a price war in order to crowd American oil producers with their relatively high production costs out of the market is not a feasible option for the Kingdom. Attempts to transform the state oil company Saudi Aramco into a mega super major utilizing on the global economic and financial potential have failed as the leading international banks and corporations avoided the company's IPO. The failure of Saudi Aramco partial privatization is a signal of a false start of a company to open the Saudi economy to large-scale inflow of foreign investment. Paradoxically the long-term perspectives of Saudi Arabia crucially depend on how effectively it will use in the coming 10-20 years oil export earnings for diversification of national economy outside the oil sector.

DT Article
DE ethnicity; politicization of ethnicity; ethnicization of politics;
   ethnopolitical mobilization; ethnic policy; ethnosymbolism
AB In the article, the phenomenon of the politicization of ethnicity is analyzed, together with the related phenomena, i.e. ethnopolitical mobilization (including pan-ethnic mobilization and demobilization), ethnicization of politics and of other social fields for political ends. The author works within the framework of constructivist and ethnosymbolist approaches. The nature, dynamics and actor structure of the processes are considered, and an attempt is made to conceptualize them correctly. The author points at the interconnectedness of the phenomena in the terminological field of the political science as well as at the necessity to distinguish them and adapt ethnopolitical strategies to their variations. The politicization of ethnicity is defined as an attachment of political functions to the ethnic identity. Ethnopolitical mobilization is different in that it has a particular goal. Main factors stimulating ethnopolitical mobilization are: dissatisfaction of a group with different aspects of its status, political opportunities, material and non-material resources available, activities of ethnopolitical elites. Pan-ethnic mobilization employs the wider group identity involving not only actors' own ethnic group but also other groups close to it within a linguacultural cluster. The ethnicization of politics is defined as the inclusion of ethnic components into the political process. Though both politics ethnicization and ethnicity politicization are typical of majority as well as minority groups, the ethnicization of politics is usually conducted "from above" employing memory archetypes and socially significant symbols. Other social identities, namely religion, sport affiliation, etc. are prone to be ethnicized for political goals, but this process has some important constraints. For instance, religion can be ethnicized if a territorially close ethnic group has other religious affiliation or is less devote; ethnicization of sport depends on a specific historical context. Especially the ethnicization of social discrepancies has a conflict potential and is to be prevented by relevant ethnopolitical management.

AB This article serves as a comprehensive literature review on cross-border minority issues in Europe, and after a thorough analysis, we discuss the role of ethnic kinship in such matters. After exploring the literature, we conclude that the theoretical frameworks deployed so far seem to be appropriate in cases of direct ethnic kinship (i.e. when the observed groups are, ethnologically speaking, the same, except for obvious regional differences), but they are insufficient for indirect ethnic kinship (i.e. when the observed groups are, ethnologically speaking, differentiated, but remain ideologically attached because of various reasons related to common history, linguistic background, identity or ancient ancestry). We provide some examples of indirect kinship, explain why the levels of political legitimation are different for all actors involved and present a new theoretical framework to study ethnic kinship not as binary, but as a phenomenon with different levels.

TI Red Nurses in the Russian Civil War: Ideology and Self-Presentation
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE sister of mercy; Red nurse; femininity; Russian Civil War; memoirs
AB The article deals with Red nurses, a unique phenomenon that appeared during the Russian Civil War. Red nurses represented a new type of women who participated in the war both as medical workers and as fighters. The history of their emergence is traced; their main tasks are identified. The nurses were ideologized by the speeches of Alexandra Kollontai, Inessa Armand, and others, who reproduced the party propaganda during the Civil War. First of all, the class difference was important. If World War I nurses were from the bourgeois class, the new nurses were workers and peasants. Their priority was not medical knowledge, but the idea of fighting for the victory of the working class. The role of the sister of mercy "above the fight" was rejected, and the Red nurse was defined as an ideological ally and comrade of the soldier. For Kollontai and Armand, the involvement of women in the military was not a temporary task limited to the period of the Civil War, but a goal of the working class. Women's participation at the front helped to overcome the prejudices that fed gender inequality. The new image of the Red nurse was formed not only on the basis of an opposition to the sister of mercy, but also in relation to the female warrior. Traditionally, a woman was becoming a warrior by taking a male name, giving up her identity of femininity. The phenomenon of the Red nurse was based not on the female/male dichotomy, but on the expansion of the identity of femininity, when the traditional female virtues (consoler, caregiver, inspirer) were supplemented by "male" valor and belligerence. In the Civil War, extended femininity ceased to be unique and became a norm for many of its female participants. In unpublished memoirs, they often identified themselves as Red nurses. This self-identification emphasized the importance for them of the role they only played during the war. Recalling the Red Sisterhood, memoirists referred to the collective "we". This way they appropriated the party's appeal to female workers as a group of like-minded women, and the collective experience presented through the narrator's "we" seemed to be objective. Self-importance was formed through the denigration of the sisters of mercy. This was a propaganda construct that passed from the speeches of party leaders into ego-documents. Another perceived idea was the image of a propagandist sister who agitated for participation in the Civil War whenever possible. Thus, the construction of the images of Red nurses depends on political discourse. In the images of Red nurses, the traditional model of femininity was expanded, which would later form the basis for the formation of the "Soviet woman" type.

DT Article
DE Germany; interstate relations; risks of instability; armed conflicts;

AB The article examines the process of the growing German political and military activity in North Africa during the second half of the 2010s. The first key reason of this process was the new awareness of the regional role in the ensuring of Germany's and the EU security. During and after the "Arab Spring", the interstate "corridor of instability" arose. It went from Mali further to Niger and Libya which has been facing permanent instability after the intervention of the group of Western countries (2011, without German participation). The full-fledged functioning of the "corridor of instability" could cause the worse version of the refugee crisis and growing terrorist activity than it was in the EU in 2015-2016. The second reason was the necessity to ensure Berlin's strong political-military positions in North Africa for the realization of Germany's ambitions as a future world power. The research examines the features and "narrow places" of interstate cooperation in the security sphere between Germany and Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria. Germany became a senior partner for Tunisia in 2015-2017, and positioned these relations as exemplary. Since 2015-2016, Germany and Egypt have been supporting the realization of each other's leadership ambitions. The key elements of this tactic have been the cooperation in Syrian and Libyan armed conflicts regulation and launch of the EU-LAS negotiation format (2019). The article also shows the dynamics of partnership between Germany and Algeria, paying special attention to bilateral cooperation in the sphere of the Mali, Libyan and Western Sahara conflicts regulation. The transition of Germany's bilateral relations with Egypt and Algeria to the level of advanced cooperation in the second half of 2010s caused a powerful growth of the FRG's arms export to these countries. At the beginning of 2020, Germany launched the multilateral Berlin conference for resolution of the Libyan conflict. Germany's late but rather successful involvement in the Libyan conflict management should ensure its efforts to become the external participant of the North African regional security system. The paper concludes about the perspectives of the FRG's political-military line in the region considering the factor of COVID-19 pandemic.

AB This article offers a gentle introduction to the measurement invariance (MI) literature with a focus on its relevance to comparative political research. It reviews 1) the conceptual foundations of MI; 2) standard procedures of testing for MI in practical applications within the multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) paradigm; and 3) two novel approaches to MI, Bayesian approximate measurement invariance, and MGCFA alignment optimization, which are especially suitable for dealing with extremely heterogeneous data from large-scale comparative surveys typical for modern political science. It then provides an empirical illustration of the key concepts and methods from the MGCFA-MI literature by applying them to testing for MI of two recently introduced measures of democracy attitudes, so-called liberal and authoritarian notions of democracy, across 60 countries in the sixth round of the World Values Survey. These analyses show that both measures can be considered reliable comparative measures of democratic attitudes, although for different reasons. Finally, this study emphasizes that some survey-based constructs, e.g., authoritarian notions of democracy, do not follow the reflective (correlation-based) logic of construct development. These alternative measures, known as formative measures, do not assume strong correlations between their indicators, for which reason it is inappropriate to test their comparability using the reflective MGCFA approach. Instead, their comparability can be tied to their correlations with theoretically relevant external variables.

AB Monotowns in Russia epitomize the mixed history of Soviet industrialized urbanization and post-soviet transformation. The 2007-8 global financial crisis magnified socio-economic problems in these cities. In spite of the deepened neoliberal urbanization observed across post-socialist cities and the global impetus of the crisis, monotowns were typically discussed within a national political framework. Our point of departure is that the monotown is an instructive site in which to explore the conundrum of global-local interconnections. To develop this argument, we conceptualize multiscalar entanglements as a base to combine analytical attention to subjective narratives with an interest in (global) structuring forces. We use this to empirically examine logics of spatial re-ordering in Russian monotowns in two analytical steps: First, we observe how federal policy introduced in response to the global crisis redefined monotowns from being territories of "crisis" and "risk" into those that offered spaces of development. Second, we focus on a particular study-site, the city of Zapolyarny and explain how the city-forming enterprise has initiated a reconstruction of the city. We find that the enterprise has reemerged as an urban governing body. In conclusion, we draw attention to emerging trends in urban inequality and insecurity constituted by these logics of spatial reordering.

AB The coronavirus crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on all aspects of the German social market economy. For the first time in history, the crisis was caused by factors of a non-economic nature. They manifested themselves in all economies of the world, including Europe. Since March 2020, the federal and state executive authorities of Germany, along with the introduction of restrictive measures for the population and business, have adopted several large-scale economic and political programmes aimed at preventing bankruptcies of economic entities, preserving jobs and social stability in the country. Along with short-term instruments designed to stop the decline in GDP and give impetus to its growth, the German state pursued an active and coordinated with Brussels structural policy aimed at ensuring an energy and digital transition to a climate-neutral economy, including the overcoming the deficits and problems revealed by the pandemic in the country's economy. To this end, Berlin abandoned the budget surplus policy and switched to large-scale external borrowing to finance programmes to bring economy out of the crisis. The author analyzes the results of the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the economic space of Germany, including aspects of its stress resistance and competitiveness, explores the effectiveness of state policy to counter crisis and assesses the prospects for the development of Russia's leading foreign economic partner in the west of the Eurasian continent.

AB This article traces the intersecting trajectories of four doctors trained as psychiatrists in the Stalinist era who went on to work in research institutes, universities and the Health Commission. Although they were all proponents of an anatomical approach, they were nonetheless rivals, sometimes competing directly with one another. Beginning with the campaign "against mechanical materialism and Menshevik idealism" launched by Stalin in December 1930, the analysis will focus on the struggles between the different protagonists to each impose their own approach and make a career, their ways of acting, and the redefinition of the social rules of science. In this article we defend a hypothesis that goes against the idea that authoritarian movements necessarily represent a closing down of the domain of the possible, arguing that they can also constitute an opening up of the possible, both individually and institutionally. These new opportunities, however, go hand in hand with the exclusion of specific approaches and the colleagues who defend them. The narrowing of possibilities did occur, but not until the early 1950s, when the political authorities decided to put an end to pluralism in science.

   1920s and 1930s; Fascism; propaganda; Orientalism; Edward Said
AB The aim of the article is to study the functioning of the key components of the Western "myth of Russia" in travelogues by Italian writers, who visited the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s, in the period of frequent cultural, political and economic contacts between the two countries. The study is based on the analysis of the travelogues by Vincenzo Cardarelli (The Journey of a Poet in Russia, 1928-1929, published in 1954) and by Corrado Alvaro (The Masters of Deluge: A Journey to Soviet Russia, 1935). Among journalists working in the USSR in those years, famous writers enjoyed a certain degree of intellectual autonomy, compared to common reporters, and were less dependent on editorial policies and censorship that is why their travelogues are among the most interesting Italian testimonies about the USSR of that period. The analysis of the texts shows that in spite of many differences in ideology, travel itinerary, and the tone of writing, the travelogues of both authors are based on the same elements of the "Russian myth", which formed in Europe during the 19th century and still shapes the Western image of Russia to a great extent. Relations between Russia and Italy are considered in the context of the East-West dichotomy, which makes the authors see Russia as a barbarian Asian country. This image together with the concept of the "Russian soul" generates a specific idea of the Russian national character, which describes Russians as collectivist, passive, fatalist, driven by a "nomadic instinct", eager to suffer, primitive and close to nature, infantile. The analysis of the topoi of the official Fascist propaganda of that period demonstrates that elements of the "Russian myth" in the Italian travelogues interact with propaganda cliches and, consequently, come to serve certain political interests, creating in public consciousness the image of the Other and thus highlighting the superiority of the Western (and, particularly, Italian) civilization. The travelogues of the 1920s and 1930s, which criticize the Soviet reality, describe Bolshevism as a typically Russian phenomenon, and support nationalist and anti-Slavic trends in Italian society, are used by the Fascist authorities as an instrument of fight against Socialists, their main ideological opponents, and, consequently, provide legitimacy to Mussolini's regime. At the same time, visits of Italian intellectuals to the USSR increased public interest towards Soviet Russia and contributed to the development of cultural and, indirectly, political and economic contacts between the two countries.

AB The role of philosophy in Russian (Soviet and post-Soviet) society over the past 100 years is considered. A century in this case is not only a generally accepted important key measure of world history but also the anniversary of the first national state research center in the field of philosophy, the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, celebrated in 2021. In the general methodological introduction, the author focuses on the place of philosophy in the system of social division of labor. The 100-year history of the academic institution, counted by the author from the establishment of the Institute of Scientific Philosophy in 1921 under the leadership of G.G. Shpet, is further subdivided into four stages: the 1920s, the victory of Lenin's ideas and the formation of an independent Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism; the 1930s-early 1950s, criticism of "Menshevik idealism" and the subordination of philosophy to the goals of party-political ideology; the 1960s-1980s, a humanistic turn of Soviet philosophy, at the origins of which were A.A. Zinov'ev and E.V. Il'enkov; and the post-Soviet period, philosophical pluralism and the loss of common orientations.

   suggestions; citizen feedback; the role of the Internet; "whole-process
   democracy"
AB The Year 2021 is significant because of the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party of China (CCP). This is a plausible opportunity to review the accomplishments of the ruling party in the last decades, especially in the period of the current leadership headed by Xi Jinping. As China under Xi is edging closer to its ultimate aim of "the Great Renaissance of the Chinese Nation", its relations with the US, the current hegemon of the world order have experienced a severe downturn. Seen against the backdrop of.hina's deteriorating relations with the US and the West in general in recent years, the public opinion in the country has generally shifted towards anti-western and patriotic sentiments. There is in the international media, as well as in academia, a widely accepted image of China under Xi Jinping as a country where there is significantly less space for pluralistic discussions, different opinions and independent voices. Critical opinions arguably have been effectively muted, and the realm of liberal freedoms has shrunk probably to the levels of the start of the reforms' era or even earlier times. An ongoing debate on the issue of interaction between the government policies and public opinion is important to a better understanding of the evolution of the Chinese polity. Does the system block all the critical voices from below and allow the information flow only top-down? Or should we probably pay more attention to the concrete efforts by the governments at different levels to stimulate and legitimize the grass-roots reactions to government policies? In this article we take a look at whether there are still vibrant channels through which common people can voice their opinions, and whether the state keeps those channels of feedback working. The overall impression is that the above-mentioned image of the resurgent totalitarianism in China's political system seriously underestimates the complexities of contemporary PRC, the country that is searching for its own China-centered methods and channels of activating citizens' political participation.

AB The article outlines the relationship between the political process and the development of "new" mass media which mainly means social networks. Electronic media, including social networks, pose a challenge to the current state of international relations. In this regard, a number of states (Belorussia, Russia, Great Britain) and supranational structures (European Commission, UN) are developing a digital legislation envisaging control over the online space. In addition to the negative aspects, the development of "new" media helps political forces in their activities. Many European politicians and political parties actively use Internet resources and micro-targeting to attract voters. The challenge for governments and researchers in this field is to understand the pros and cons of the new digital era and to develop a plan for integrating new technologies into the familiar political process. It is concluded that the European Union and other states are at the stage of development and entry into force of uniform rules regulating the Internet. The trend towards the formation of a single legal field is combined with legislative regulation at the national level, since this area affects issues of security and sovereignty.

AB The article outlines the main populist political parties of the Republic of Moldova, the main reasons for their appearance and socio-political factors that determined the content of the populist discourse in the post-Soviet period. Firstly, the phenomenon of new populism in Moldova arises from the high involvement of external players in its internal political life, who often associate themselves with the Moldovan political forces, acting as their constant allies. Secondly, the political forces of Moldova are characterized by impermanence of interests, which under the influence of external forces are able to transform, sometimes taking cardinal forms. Considering populist rhetoric and technologies as the main resource of political actors in conditions of uncertainty, the authors assess parties on both the right and left sides of the political spectrum. It is highlighted that the dominant themes of populist discourse in modern Moldova are the following: the opposition of the European integration model to the alternative movement for closer cooperation with Russia, the traditional left-wing opposition to liberal constructs in the economic sphere, and the problem of corruption. It is concluded that populist rhetoric may expand in the coming years and that a number of populist parties will consolidate on both the left and right flanks of the political spectrum. Populist rhetoric is presented in one way or another in almost all political parties, but the real populist forces will not enter the political establishment and will remain non-majoritarian.

AB Are economic actors equally sensitive to institutional conditions? While existing research recognizes that institutions can have varying effects on actors' interests, the implicit assumption is that actors are homogeneous in how sensitive they are to their institutional environment. We investigate this assumption in the context of foreign direct investment, arguing that actors from countries with weaker institutions will be less affected by information about host country institutional conditions-both good and bad. We test this argument using survey data from a diverse group of managers-in-training at an international business school. We find that when asked to evaluate a potential foreign investment location, respondents from developing countries are significantly less sensitive to information about the host country's courts than their counterparts from developed economies. In contrast, we find that economic actors from both developed and developing countries respond similarly to information about the stability of economic policies. The findings suggest that sensitivity to the risks and safeguards of certain institutional conditions vary systematically across actors, depending on both the home environment to which economic actors have been exposed and the type of host institution.

AB Doctrines of the philosophy of right took a special place in philosophers' investigations in German universities at the turn of the 20th century. This was mainly due to the formation of the science of right as an independent discipline in the 19th century. The basis of discussions in the sphere of the philosophy of right was the questions of the methodology of the new science of right, the correlation of the empirical and philosophical science of right. The ideas of the Neo-Kantian philosopher Emil Lask take a prominent place in the context of discussions about right in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in particular, in opposition to practice-oriented legal positivism and Neo-Kantianism. In my investigation I try to reconstruct Lask's docrine of right set out in his dissertation Philosophy of Right (1905), in which Lask seeks to overcome the extremes philosophies of right in the spirit of Kantianism and Hegelianism. This opportunity is given by an understanding of the philosophy of right as a doctrine of the type of attribution to value, as well as the formulation of a special understanding of the "social" type of attribution to value, combining and individualizing Kant's ethics and Hegel's social teachings. A necessary condition for the methodology of the new doctrine of right is, according to Lask, the approval of the pre-scientific stage of knowledge. The material of cultural sciences, in particular, of right, is a unity of the material of reality and the material that appeared as a result of the prescientific formation of concepts. The methodology developed by Lask provided for the formation of a "logic of right" as a special value perspective for researching right. The science of right is the result of an epistemological analysis of legal experience. Through the perspective of the philosophy of values of Baden Neo-Kantianism, it serves as a response to the metaphysical doctrines of right and the developing practice-oriented legal theories of the positivist sense in the second half of the 19th century. The "Philosophy of Right" is an organic stage in the formation of a mature philosophical project of Lask - the logic of philosophy.

AB The article deals with the Greek concept of acrateia (alpha KPATEIA) and the political history of its usage from Antiquity till the 21st-century philosophy. We insist that there is a relation between the connotations of this concept prevailing in texts and those political and cultural contexts that served as their conceptual landscapes - especially the political discourses of power. We focus on the specific political consequences of the procedure, which produces and fixes connotations of concepts, and try to problematize power discourses optics within the theoretical framework of our research based on the historical analysis of the political history of using acrateia as a concept and on the hermeneutic analysis of the philosophical texts in which this concept was defined and implemented. Within the given perspective, related concepts and historical contexts of their usage are compared; the methodological and conceptual potential of the concept "acratic optics" is established as a possible synonym for the concept "anarchist optics" to allow the productive and detailing elaboration of its meaning by emphasizing its philosophical foundations. Relying on the Greek texts by Plato, Aristotle, Xenophon, and others, we have made an effort to review the range of conventional meanings of various morphological forms of the concept "acrateia" (especially negative ones) to show the possibility of their implicit potential redefining in terms of the positive sense of "freedom", without "reducing" these meanings to the "lack of power" or "incontinence" only, which discredited, caricaturized and destructed the possible positive meanings of acrateia as "freedom", "independence", or " absence of power" like in the related barbaric word "acratia" (alpha KPATEIA). Thus, two acratic modalities in official political and philosophical discourses are discovered and analyzed in the article. One of them is the negative meaning "incontinence" or "lack of power" in terms of the power discourse: in its framework, the multi-stage modalization of the concept's meaning established only the negative potential of this word. The other one, which we try to reconstruct using the hermeneutic analysis of the Ancient Greek sources, is neutral or positive one. We introduce the procedure of a "step-by-step definition" for political designation of concepts, which shows that the positive sense of this word is possible, and even mention the example of its usage in the neutral sense by Aristotle in Meteorology to prove that its neutral meaning was also fixed in ancient times. We hope the article could contribute to shedding the light on the non-obvious or intentionally hidden senses of the word "acrateia" as well as of its paronymic terms "acratic", "acratia", "acrates", etc. As a result of the present study, we redefine the "redefined" term and try to return to the investigated concept its initial meanings, especially those acquired "apophatically" during the long political history of its existence.

AB In the early 21st century, many European countries saw an increased influence of political parties relying on localized communities. Many new regional parties (RPs) emerged, which put the scientific community in need of understanding the reasons behind their strengthening positions in Europe. The present research provides a critical review of the RPs' definitions, examines their origins, place in the political spectrum, factors of electoral success and geographical distribution of their electorate. The study is based on the analysis of the parliamentary and regional elections results in 43 European countries in 2000-2019. A map of the RP support rate by region has been designed, showing areas of the strongest public support. Its correlation with ethnic and cultural composition, political structure, and uneven regional development of the countries of Western and Eastern Europe has been analyzed. Today, in parliamentary and regional elections, RPs receive more than 5% of votes in the area of around 600 sq. kms, or 40% of the European territory (overseas territories excluded). Particular attention is paid to party strategies in national and regional elections. Modern RPs diversify their programs going far beyond the interests of a particular sociocultural group. In parliamentary elections, they often make alliances with national parties. In turn, national parties sometimes speak in regional elections "under the local brand". The satisfaction of the RPs' demands to provide the regions with greater autonomy does not have a significant impact on their strategies, which request increasingly wider powers. Despite the fact that individual regional parties even get seats in national parliaments, they have practically no influence on the state policy shaping. Their rise is associated not with electoral results, but with trends in the European political process. One can speak not about the success of particular parties, but about the advancement of the idea of regionalism.

AB The article offers a methodology to overcome the shortcomings in the factionalism approach to studying elite politics in China. The authors study professional ties among 204 full members of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party through social network analysis to identify influential members of the elites and detect their communities. Four types of data calculation are used - degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector centralities, as well as Louvain method to identify clusters of interconnected members of the network. Xi Jinping has no match per betweenness centrality; once a major contender for becoming China's leader Vice Premier Hu Chunhua scores the second. Shanghai is a key contributor of elites in spite of Xi promoting loyal cadres from Zhejiang and Fujian. The concentration of power in Xi's hands is confirmed, the imbalance between centrality scores and real positions of certain officials speaking for a reduced sustainability of the political system.

AB The author of the article believes the beginning of the "Putin's era" - the first two terms of his presidency (2000-2008) - to be generally successful for Russia. In eight years, the bases of the state shaken in the 1990s were strengthened, the threat of an intensive political struggle, which, however, lost much of its outdoor competitive nature, decreased, the economy became stronger, the living conditions of the population improved, the activity and influence of Russia in international affairs increased. This was largely due to the favorable global economic environment for Russia and, above all, high prices for energy resources, which were the main item of Russian exports. No less obvious were the personal achievements of President Putin, who managed to consolidate the unbalanced state, put an end to the pressure of oligarchs on authorities, restore the Kremlin's control over regional elites, and extinguish hotbeds of separatism in Russia. He has built the very "vertical of power" for which his political opponents, both inside the country and abroad, will consistently criticize him. Having inherited Boris Yeltsin's policy of developing cooperation with the West, Vladimir Putin at first continued to follow this path, but gradually became disillusioned with the sincerity of Western partners towards Russia. He was most concerned about the eastward expansion of NATO's military infrastructure, its approach to Russian borders, and the West's general reluctance to consider Russian interests. Putin openly expressed the accumulated claims against the United States and NATO in February 2007 at the Munich Security Conference. 2007 was a turning point in Putin's foreign policy towards the West. Since then, the focus has been shifted to protecting Russia's national interests. Within the country, for eight years, Putin had failed to create a modern, self-regulating and multi-level system of government. The destructive chaos of the 1990s was replaced by centralized "manual control" from the Kremlin, but it also worked with constant failures. The state apparatus, especially at the regional level, did not work effectively enough, and regional authorities often did not follow the orders of the President. The lessons of the first stage of the Putin's era were: the reasonably required consolidation of the state, building the "vertical of power" often occurred at the expense of the civil society's interests, the interests of consolidating and expanding democracy in Russia.

DT Article
DE India; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Indo-Pacific; Indian Ocean region
ID SECURITY
AB The article focuses on the Indian version of the Indo-Pacific concept. The author notes that the Russian attitude towards Indo-Pacific is ambiguous, and argues that the reason is the vague and unstructured concept as such. The article analyzes the origin and history of the term Indo-Pacific itself. The author traces its history back 170 years and describes in detail how it was transformed during these years, consistently evolving from an exclusively geographical name to a geopolitical construct, then to an oceanographic term, then to a geopolitical construct again. Further, the author analyzes in detail the preconditions in the political, cultural, economic and security spheres, that had developed by the time of the emergence of the Indo-Pacific concept: India's desire to form a sphere of political influence within the borders of the Indian Ocean region, confirming its status as a great power; concerns about Chinese expansion and the alleged "String of Pearls" strategy in the Indian Ocean; the desire to restore the cultural and civilizational unity of the Indosphere; an attempt to build a comprehensive economic strategy that would allow India with relying on regional organizations, bilateral ties and trade megablocks to catch up with China economically. Because of these preconditions the idea of the Indo-Pacific, proposed by the experts, was immediately accepted by the political elites of India and turned into one of the pillars of Indian foreign policy. The author identifies two main visions of the Indo-Pacific in Indian discourse: as an anti-Chinese concept and as a broader cultural and civilizational concept, which should serve as a basis for India's further expansion into the Pacific. However, economic problems may prevent this concept from being further strengthened and turned into a full-fledged initiative. Nevertheless, India is unlikely to abandon the idea of the Indo-Pacific, so Russia should develop its own version of the Indo-Pacific concept, which would be combined with the Indian one and at the same time correspond to the interests of Russia.

AB The post-Soviet period of Moldova's history was complex and ambiguous. It was characterized by a difficult socio-economic situation, important transformations of the foreign policy, malign influence of corruption, mass departure of the able-bodied population outside the republic. Recent years have not been an exception. The turbulent events of 2016.2020, which are analyzed, became a new important stage in the life of Moldova, solidifying the trends of its development in the next decade. The authors analyze the key events of this period, of its domestic and foreign policy: the issues of the creation and functioning of a broad coalition in the summer of 2019, its collapse, the formation of a new coalition between socialists and democrats, the presidential elections in Moldova and their impact on the political situation. The authors note that the recent trends in the political development of Moldova and its foreign policy show that in the near future political instability in the republic will continue. The question is if, in the context of internal political polarization in the country, it will be possible to reach a geopolitical consensus around Moldova and prevent the acute political confrontation in the country from turning into a long-term political and institutional crisis.

AB Introduction. Today, foreign language competence of a person is a necessary means of active social and professional life. Despite this, quite a lot of young people do not always have the desire to learn foreign languages. This paradox made the motivation to learn foreign languages a popular issue to research worldwide. The article presents the scoping review of international studies devoted to the issue of motivation to learn foreign languages. First of all, it is necessary to understand the research trends in the study of this issue in general, and to determine factors, which influence the lack of students' interest to learn foreign languages in particular.
   The aim of the present research is to outline the current focus trends and to define the gaps in international research papers aimed at investigating the issue of motivation for foreign languages learning.
   Methodology and research methods. The methodological framework of the current research is based on the qualitative content analysis of relevant empirical research on this issue from the periodicals indexed by the international databases Scopus and Web of Science over the last 15 years. This review will provide an understanding of the degree of knowledge of the analysed issues at the international level.
   Results. The research works on the issues of motivation for foreign languages learning were divided into two main categories: the research works concentrated on inner - academic and professional factors, and the works which deal with the outer - social factors of influence. Within these groups, the existing research trends and the most promising research areas were identified (for instance, the influence of peers on the motivational sphere of students). Amongst the numerous works investigating external (socio-economic) factors of influence, there is insufficient research on the influence of macro-political and macro-economic factors on the motivation for learning languages (for instance, foreign languages learning preferences). The research outcomes will contribute to understanding the factors, which influence the students' lack of interest in learning foreign languages.
   The scientific novelty is in the originality of the demonstrated review, which includes many scientific papers performed by scientists from all over the world and based on various research procedures. In the review, the geographical principle of data selection was not used and the publication date was not taken into account. The main selection criterion was a research paper to be published in a journal peer-reviewed by international databases over the last 15 years.
   Such a principle was necessary to understand research trends in the issue of motivation for mastering a foreign language competence and to determine similar (or specific) factors for different countries, which cause students' lack of interest in learning foreign languages.
   Practical significance. The results of the obtained analysis will give understanding of the reasons for the lack of students' motivation to study foreign languages. Moreover, it will help to find a solution to this international challenge.

AB This paper offers a brief social history of the hospice movement in Russia. The author explains why the hospice movement has become so relevant over the last five years in modern Russia; who the people are who lead this movement; how their ideas collide with 'reality'; and what consequences of this collision can already be observed. The author presents the Russian hospice movement as a dynamic social process which arises in the particular context of the political protests of 2011-2012. The paper is based on the first results of ethnographic research conducted in several hospices in Siberia, as well as on data from in-depth interviews with hospice movement activists and archival materials. The author argues that the hospice movements in contemporary Russia serve a social function as grassroots mediation for social and economic care between local bureaucracy and patients.

AB The question of whether science is a good cannot be resolved in one article just because the concept of good allows for a variety of meanings and connotations. The article discusses the ideas of Ilya Kasavin, who concretizes this concept in relation to science. Criticizing this approach, the author, for his part, deconstructs what Kasavin proposed and conceptualizes the diversity of the usefulness of science in three key horizons: social, temporal and thematic. In the social dimension, science, on the one hand, really responds to the demands of external consumers of a scientific product; on the other, it acts as a generator of social "critical rationality", which in turn is assimilated by the same consumers. In the temporal dimension, only science, based on its theories, is able to formulate useful forecasts and predictions. Finally, in the thematic dimension, the proper function of the scientific communicative system is carried out, namely, fundamental scientific research in the form of propositional (false/true) knowledge. This three-dimensional space of scientific communication makes it extremely difficult and ambivalent to respond to the question Kasavin posed about the public good of science. After all, a positive meaning in the thematic horizon (say, the self-valuable and autonomously rational interest of scientists, for example, to the structure of the atom) can turn out to be high-risk, dangerous and high-cost in the social dimension, which means that it acquires a negative meaning in it.

AB Citizens are an active subject of the urban environment development, they formulate and express their request for the comfort of the city through discourses. In this regard, an urgent problem is to determine the criteria for the comfort of the urban environment and the attitude of citizens to the city through the analysis of their discursive practices. For this purpose, a study was conducted, the object of which was the residents of the city of Tomsk. A total of 22 semi-formal interviews were held, during which citizens freely expressed their attitude to the city as a whole, focused on their values in the context of the urban environment, pointed out the shortcomings of the urban space, and described in detail their understanding of the comfort of the urban environment. The method of analysis was discourse analysis of interview texts. The main conclusions of the study are the following. Firstly, the informants understand a comfortable city as a place where citizens have everything that is important to them and, at the same time, do not interfere with other people's lives. Secondly, the assessments of Tomsk are diverse and contradictory; they include retrospective and territorial-state aspects, are divided into negative, combined and positive. When giving assessments, the informants are guided primarily by personal values and meanings. In this regard, for a better understanding of comfort, it is necessary to analyze the criteria for evaluating the urban environment. Thirdly, the categories of comfort of the city have been divided into two groups - related to vital (environment, power, security, demography, infrastructure, leisure categories) and existential (citizens' activity, citizens' moral qualities, emotional, socio-humanistic, personal, self-realization opportunity categories) needs of citizens. They are equal in number; thus, it can be inferred that at the moment the satisfaction of citizens' vital needs in the urban environment becomes a matter of course and takes a back seat, while existential needs become the most relevant. It is existential needs that citizens pay more attention to when forming a request for the quality of the urban space. However, when planning the development of the urban environment, city managers focus on vital categories, which is confirmed by official ratings of the quality of cities - there are practically no existential categories in them. Thus, the study confirms the fact that the understanding of the comfort by government representatives and by citizens is different. Therefore, it is obvious that there is a need to form a common semantic field of interaction, a dialogue between government structures and citizens to coordinate ideas and form common goals for the development of the city.

AB The article investigates the problem of the philosophical and anthropological foundations of the new educational policy with an aim of determining the key foundations and prerequisites for the emergence of a new anthropological education project. The article attempts to deduce the image of a person that may lie behind the current discussions about the results and content of education that take place in the emerging educational policy. The central concept of the article is the anthropological project, which is considered as the basis of educational paradigms and formations. The connection between the anthropological project of education and didactics, which plays a key role in the practical implementation of the philosophical and anthropological foundations of a particular educational system, is investigated. The prerequisites for the formation of the modern anthropological project, which contain ideas about the "person of the future" to the idea of further development of the theory and philosophy of education, are considered. The basic research methods were: a content-genetic analysis of the main categories and principles of open education didactics; explication of its system-forming principles in accordance with the category "anthropological project of education". In the course of the study, anthropological projects were analyzed as a context for the development of education. Two approaches were identified to describe the relationship between education and anthropological projects, which can be considered as the foundations of educational activity. The dual structure of anthropological projects is considered, which is expressed in the fact that the practical implementation of idealized images of a person can lead to the formation of ideologies focused on achieving opposite results laid down in these images. Based on the materials reflecting the essence of the discussion in modern educational policy, the possible prerequisites for a new anthropological project were analyzed. As a result of the study, the prerequisites for a new anthropological project were identified, which are associated with the study of a person's ability to live and act in the future, while the future is interpreted in different contexts. In the first case, the future is viewed as a problem of uncertainty, in which a person needs to be able to effectively navigate; in the second as a planetary crisis, in which a person needs to learn to survive by changing their attitude to the world (or even worlds) around them and revising the status of their own subjectivity.

AB This article is a part of the discussion of Ilya Kasavin's article "Science: A Public Good and a Humanistic Project". The author agrees with Kasavin's opinion on the importance of forming a new approach to humanism and considering science as a humanistic project. The author substantiates the possibility of forming a new mission of scientists as the formation of a new approach to humanism. In a world, in which confidence in large narratives has been lost, various strategies for the production of knowledge are criticized, and the mind can justify inhuman actions, the question arises about the specific mission of scientists and science as a humanistic project. The humanistic project was formed during the Renaissance. In this project, the human occupies a central position in the world. With the power of reason, s/he can transform the world. Science relies on the same assumption. In the new conditions of a technogenic civilization, it is necessary to form a new humanistic project. It can be based on the joint mission of scientists, philosophers and sociologists. Within the framework of the technogenic civilization, non-human actors have a huge impact on the realization of projects. Therefore, the mission will be aimed at forming a new attitude towards the human who is now included in the world on an equal footing with non-human actors. In this case, a new humanistic project can be associated with the formation of a new approach to the construction and understanding of the place of the human in the world and the processes of forming new knowledge. Science is such a humanistic project. Constructing a world shared by humans and non-human actors through will and representation is the new mission of scientists.

DE Republic of Tajikistan; educational system; Russian language;

AB The aim of this research is to define the place and role of the educational system that was formed in the Republic of Tajikistan in the process of achieving the goal that republic has set for itself: poverty elimination by transforming the country into an agrarian-industrial state by 2030. This article is based on the following sources: data from the World Bank researches carried out in 20102020 on the social and economical development of the Republic of Tajikistan, data from the Agency on Statistics under the President of the Republic of Tajikistan for 2000-2020, and data from independent international nongovernmental organizations and researchers. The author came to the following conclusion. As a result of the civil war in the 1990s, the Republic of Tajikistan lost about 1/3 of its gross national income. More than 800 thousand people left the country - mostly highly skilled professionals, which led to the interruption in the transfer of knowledge and skills, and to the sharp degradation of the various spheres of the economy. But the educational system of Tajikistan was the hardest hit. The end of the civil war and the establishment of a stable political system led to a rather quick resurrection of the country's economy. GNI's growth in the first quarter of the 21st century was almost 5% per year. The basis for the educational system of the independent Tajikistan was the education law adopted in 2004. It formulated the main principles for the functioning of this system and served as a basis for a whole set of laws that formed a complete educational system in the Republic of Tajikistan. However, the result of the catastrophic decline in the educational level during the civil war and the following period of reconstruction was that by 2020 the educational system, with the help of the government, was only able to heal the wounds. A major role was also played by Russia, which rendered significant financial and methodological assistance to the Republic of Tajikistan in this process. With Russia's help, Tajikistan was able to reconstruct and build new schools, receive thousands of new textbooks and teaching guides; leading Russian universities opened their branches in Tajikistan; every year Russia allocates more that 600 quotas for teaching Tajik students in the leading Russian universities; annually 50 Russian language teachers are sent to the country. The national development strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan for the period up to 2030 assigns a significant part in its implementation to the educational system. However, the flaws in it and its place in the structure of the Tajik government and in the priorities of the social, political, and economic development make it impossible to assume that the level of education in the republic will significantly change in the near future, and that science and knowledge-based industries will appear in the country.

DE doubt; attempt at doubt; epoche; term; experience
AB The article analyzes the way of introducing the terms "epoche" and "phenomenological reduction" denoting the basic procedure of the phenomenological method. Husserl's attempt to present epoche as a special kind of experience is considered. The basic presupposition of the research is the difference between terms and experience, as well as terms and metaphors. The introduced terms with other terms that directly refer to intersubjectively available experience - "doubt" and "attempt at doubt" - are correlated. The distinction is made between terms and metaphors, or images ("put out of action", "disconnexion", "bracketing", etc.), which are usually used to characterize the basic procedures of the phenomenological method. This kind of metaphors is seen as an obstacle to distinguishing between a term ("concept") and the experience denoted by the term. The uncritical use of metaphors results, as a rule, in the interpretation of the meanings of terms in the commentary literature, rather than in the analysis of the experience they indicate. Descartes' and Husserl's different ways of transforming the experience of doubt for methodological purposes are considered. The introduction of "epoche" as the basis of the phenomenological method is assessed as an important moment on Husserl's way to phenomenological transcendentalism, with its characteristic tendency to go beyond experience within experience itself. Just like the Cartesian Ego in the first edition of Logical Investigations turns out to be not "completely empirical" in Husserl, epoche appears as a certain mixture of the natural and the artificial. The transformation of the experience of doubt into an attempt of doubt serves as the main means of presenting epoche as a quasi-experience, as the als ob experience. What Husserl designated as epoche or phenomenological reduction contains the hidden elements of doubt as real experience; however, Husserl ultimately rejects these elements, "extracting" the procedure of epoche from the experience of doubt and transforming experience into a transcendental condition of experience.

DE digital sovereignty; technological transformations; digitalization;

AB Due to the high level of digital transformations, the study of the phenomenon of digital sovereignty of the state deserves great attention. Within the framework of this study, methods of expert interviews and focus group discussions were used to determine the degree of relevance and significance of ensuring digital sovereignty of Russia, as well as to identify its content and structural components, taking into account the vision of practitioners. In the course of 80 expert interviews, the vast majority of experts (83.3%) noted the extremely high relevance and significance of the problem of digital sovereignty. In their opinion, this is due to the ongoing (and to some extent forced by the conditions of the pandemic) digital transformation in many, including traditional, spheres of life of the state and society. The problem is also actualized by the extraterritoriality of digital technologies and the fact that the main lines of tension in geopolitical terms are largely associated with "technological conflicts". Some experts expressed a generally skeptical attitude to the possibility of ensuring full-fledged digital sovereignty in the conditions of usage of global digital communications of an extraterritorial nature. The most "popular" sign of digital sovereignty, according to experts, is the right to manage digital resources operating in the national segments of the digital space independently. Digital sovereignty in the framework of this conceptual prism is presented as the ability of the state to independently determine the degree and methods of its participation or non-participation in relations associated with the use of digital technologies to realize its interests. In addition, a sign of digital sovereignty, according to some experts, is the presence of the state's own effective and highly competitive software products for solving a wide range of tasks. Another group of expert views on the phenomenon of digital sovereignty is related to its competence aspect - it focuses on the ability to use digital resources, as well as on the ability of the state to conduct an independent foreign and domestic policy in the digital space. The model of digital sovereignty includes regulatory, technological, competence, political, economic and managerial components, which, when combined into a single system, create the emergent property of digital sovereignty. The full implementation of each component is a critical condition for the formation of a sustainable digital sovereignty of a modern state. In turn, its provision is the most important strategic task, the effective solution of which is one of the key national priorities of modern Russia.

DE logical procedure; cognitive procedure; natural thinking; logical

AB The article contains the results of a study of logical procedures (LPs) as a variety of cognitive ones. The psychological and logical approaches to the analysis of LPs are differentiated. A logical and philosophical interpretation of LPs in the formal paradigm as a system of proof and proof-search (by Vladimir Bryushinkin) is discussed. The methodological and applied problems associated with this interpretation are formulated. In particular, a modeling relation between a formal LP and natural thinking procedures deprives the former of the status of a constructive element of cognitive processes. Moreover, natural reasoning loses the sign of logicality. The necessity of a system interpretation of LPs as a subject-object structure is substantiated. The LP concept is constructed through the restriction of the cognitive procedure concept. It is emphasized that: the LP object is logical forms of thought, the subject is their logical properties and relations; process and result are always expressed in some language; the result is a logical object. The LP is defined as a system of cognitive operations (carried out by a subject using a natural or artificial language) on logical signs of logical forms of thought, aimed at constructing a logical object with characteristics caused by these signs. The LP class is analyzed. Procedures for operating with logical objects and procedures for their generation are differentiated in it. The LP conceptual signs and the cognitive parameters of the thinking processes are correlated. The following procedures are eliminated from the LP set: metalogical procedures for interpreting a certain context as a logical task; intellectual operations on logical forms of thought with significant destructions of their macrostructures; pseudo-logical operations of human thinking based on the manipulations of language constructs. The article reflects the first part of a research on LPs. The second part will discuss the analysis of the structural characteristics of LPs, the problem of differentiation of normative and descriptive forms, the coverage of applied issues of the LP theory.

AB The article focuses on the origins and history of the academic and public discussion on the discriminatory depiction of non-European races in the anthropological works of Immanuel Kant. The first part contains a brief analysis of key works and passages that are at the core of the discussion: fragments of lectures on anthropology and physical geography, Kant's minor works of the 1770s and 1780s (Of the Different Races of Human Beings, Determination of the Concept of a Human Race, On the Use of Teleological Principles in Philosophy) and the paragraph on races in Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View.

While providing a critical account of the arguments of scholars participating in the discussion (which can be roughly divided into two groups or interpretative strategies), I also present my point of view: there are, indeed, racist statements and classifications in Kant's minor works and lectures, although they do not affect the main elements of his critical philosophy; in his late works of the 1790s, Kant abandons his discriminatory approach to the description of races in the light of his idea of cosmopolitanism. In the final part, I present some aspects, results and possible conclusions from the discussion on Kant's concept of race that I deem to be important for historians of philosophy and those interested in classical European philosophy. In this regard, I distinguish three key aspects of the problem: the historical aspect which concerns the genesis of Kant's anthropology in general and his idea of race in particular; the practical aspect which relates to the question on our view of Kant's texts and ideas as subjects of teaching and study; the theoretical-philosophical aspect concerning the evolution of Kant's anthropological ideas and the role of the concept of race in Kant's practical philosophy. My key argument here is that while there is explicit evidence that some of Kant's remarks on different races can be called racist from our contemporary point of view, we cannot use this evidence as an argument against Kant's anthropology as a whole or as a basis for any restriction of studying Kant's texts in the academic curriculum.

AB The article presents the results of research, a comprehensive scientific review and analysis of the main approaches to the problem of the evolutionary development of transport and transit systems (TTS) and the interface of infrastructure and integration projects in order to form the Greater Eurasian partnership (GEAP) in the space of Global Eurasia. Transport and construction, organizational and institutional problems of infra-structural support for the formation of GEAP are identified. It is shown that the research community has three options for considering the infrastructure integration project "Belt and road" (B&R), such as: building a network of routes for Euro-Asian transport; including a comprehensive mechanism for China's external expansion and its international trade relations to solve internal problems; forming a global political, social, economic, and cultural space based on the movement of energy, goods, technologies, competencies, and others. It is proved that at present only the Chinese B&R initiative can become an effective basis for the evolutionary development and integration of infrastructure and integration projects in the Greater Eurasia area. A scientific review of possible ways to use the Chinese B&R initiative to form a GEAP with Russia's leading participation is given. The most effective forms and methods of combining alternative B&R infrastructure and integration projects for the formation of GEAP for the development of the TTS of Russia have been identified.

AB The article is let in to disclosure the content of scientific understanding of the processes of agrarian colonization of the Steppe region in the modern historiography of Russia and the Republic of Kazakhstan. The research procedures are based on the methodological principles of the new cultural and intellectual history, and the reliability of the conclusions is determined by a complex of historiographic sources. The author's team found that the historiographical tradition of the stated problem was formed in scientific schools of Russia and Kazakhstan under the influence of "traumatic" events of the colonial past, which influenced the Genesis and evolution of ideas about the causes, course and results of the process of Imperial incorporation of the Steppe region into Russia in the second half of the XIX-early XX centuries. In the construction of the subject part of the study, the socio-cultural and political background of the institutionalization of approaches to scientific reflection of the issue was taken into account. It is proved that a positive result of the historiographical discourse of the Russian and Kazakh scientific schools can be active communication in the scientific field, an appeal to modern research approaches and practices, including the "new history of the Empire", which actualizes the common "trauma" of colonization for the Kazakh and Russian peoples.

AB The paper examines perceptions of Russian literature in the first half of the 1920s by a Czech literary criticism of the left-wing political orientation, namely by Rude Pravo, newspaper of the communist party of Czechoslovakia. On the one hand, at this time, the Russian classics are being rethought in terms of their usefulness for the purposes of proletarian movement, up to discrediting individual authors (for example, F. M. Dostoevsky) and adjusting ideas of other writers to the communist ideology (L. N. Tolstoy). On the other hand, much attention of the editors is paid to the modern literature of post-revolutionary Russia, whose representatives are evaluated and selected for translation and review, provided they accept and praise the revolution (first of all, this is the poem The Twelve by A. A. Blok, poetry by V. V. Mayakovsky, prose by M. Gorky and V. G. Korolenko), whereas their work is assessed one-sidedly, exclusively in the ideological aspect. The first attempts of writing generalizing materials on the contemporary literary process (for example, Peasant revolutionary poetry by I. Weil) are being made. In general, Russian literature is viewed from an ideological standpoint, only with varying degrees of categoricality by individual critics. As the author reveals it was of great importance for the shaping of the ideological position and cultural program of the Czech communists, and compared with other literatures, its role is identified as leading.

AB The article examines the trends that hinder the development of international energy and economic cooperation in 2018-2020. These trends have been particularly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting global economic and energy crisis. Falling demand for oil has affected the decline in world commodity prices. Competition between oil exporters has intensified amid falling demand. As a result, international energy cooperation mechanisms in the energy sector have come under serious pressure. The dynamics of relations between the world's largest economic centers: China, the United States, the European Union, and the Eurasian space have become another aspect of the aggravation of imbalances and confrontational trends in the global economy. The strengthening of trade contradictions between the United States and China in 2018-2019 negatively affected global economic growth and the dynamics of major manufacturing indices. In turn, the events of 2020 clearly confirmed that the contradictions between China and the United States are of a deep structural nature. These contradictions exacerbate the polarization of the global economic system and cannot be overcome by concessions and agreements exclusively in the field of investment and trade. Against this background, the real effectiveness of measures taken in the EU to deal with the economic consequences of both the pandemic and Brexit is questionable, and can only be reliably assessed after a sufficiently long time. The authors show that in contrast to the situation in the EU, the EAEU has tendencies to further strengthen economic, political and energy cooperation. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economic crisis and external challenges, the Eurasian economic Union not only stands up to them, but also continues to actively work to unite the Union's countries, as well as improve their energy and economic security. The authors offer their vision of further development of international economic and energy cooperation in the post-pandemic period, taking into account the positive trends in the development of the Eurasian space.

TI FUNCTIONS OF CIVIC EDUCATION: TEACHERS' PRIORITIES
SO OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
LA Russian
DT Article
DE civic education; civicism; citizenship; social studies; teacher;
   education functions; education priorities
AB Introduction. A wide range of valuable and active aspects related to citizenship remain not relevant, which leads to the atomisation of society, weakening of the institutional foundations of the state. Today, the development of the civic education system is an important social issue. Therefore, turning to the experience of other countries, including in terms of building their priorities in this area, contributes to the solution of both theoretical and practical problems in national education. It is customary to associate the civic component in the Russian educational system with the implementation of state educational standards aimed at obtaining formal knowledge about society and the state by schoolchildren, as well as with the systematic educational work carried out in educational institutions, focusing on the development of patriotism. As a result, the structure of youth civic orientations is dominated by intentions to consciously distance oneself from politics, the state, a narrowly formalised understanding of citizenship as a set of rights and obligations fixed by law, and patriotism mainly in its protective-military form.
   The aim of the present research was to comparatively study the opinions of teachers in 22 countries (including Russia) on the priorities of civic education in schools.
   Methodology and research methods. A secondary analysis of the data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study, implemented under the auspices of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievements (IEA), serves as a research method. The empirical base of the study is a questionnaire survey of teachers from 22 countries (including Russia). The total sample size was 36674 respondents - 8849 teachers (24% of the sample size), implementing programmes of social sciences, 27825 teachers (76% of the sample size) not directly involved in civic education.
   Results and scientific novelty. As a result of the comparative study undertaken, the specificity of the opinion of teachers in Russia and other countries regarding the importance of certain areas of civic education in schools was revealed. The answers to a special question were analysed, suggesting the choice of the most priority options from the proposed ones. At the first stage, a ranking procedure was implemented, which allowed to identify the structure of priorities in each country. In most of them, the formation among students of independent, critical thinking occupies the first position in the ranking. This goal is especially significant in the Scandinavian countries, as well as in Finland. In Russia, the level of support for this priority is one of the lowest (36%) - less than only in South Korea (24%). At the second stage, the target settings of teachers involved in civic education are classified. Using cluster analysis, the types of orientations are determined, that is, a combination of various combinations of answers, and their prevalence among civilian educators. Seven types of orientations have been identified and described: critical, socialisation, social studies, participatory, environmental, conflictological, particularistic. The features of their representation in different countries are described.
   Practical significance. The results and conclusions presented in the article, the proposed typology can be used in the process of further development of the issues of civic education, training and education of citizenship, including in other empirical studies. The quantitative data provided can be used as an information base for the development of civic education programmes at various levels, as well as the design of curricula and content of disciplines of civic studies.

AB In the struggle of Russia's Indigenous northerners for greater control over their ancestral lands, the spatiolegal formations known as Territories of Traditional Nature Use (TTPs, using the Russian acronym) have become their most effective tool. TTPs have assumed diverse characteristics across Russian regions in response to the evolution of federal and sub-federal law and of center-periphery relations at national and regional scales. In the Sakha Republic (Iakutiia), TTP formation is entangled with wider territorial politics and economic trends, which have led to the precarious but powerful advancement of Indigenous rights. This article explores this evolution by comparing the creation of two neighboring TTPs, formed eight years apart under distinct political and legislative conditions. A combination of local efforts, subnational legislative and economic initiatives, and reaction to federal overstep have compelled the improvement and systematization of Indigenous rights in the republic.

AB The paper traces connections of the works by Eurasian and Russian avant-garde directors Dzig. Vertov and Vsevolod Pudovkin. With this purpose it addresses cinematic creations of mentioned authors and teachings of Eurasian movement, especially by N. S. Trubetskoy. In his opinion, to analyze Russian history, one must take into account the geographical, political and economic components. He paid special attention to the geographical factor. The population of Russia-Eurasia includes various "human races": both Slavic and Finno-Ugric peoples, as well as Turkic and Mongolian peoples. The Turan element occupies a significant part of the territory. Genghis-khan united all nomadic tribes under his sway and introduced Asian statehood in Russia. Moscow Rus form the basis of the Russian Empire after joining it former Golden Horde's uluses. The views of N. S. Trubetskoy largely correlate with the ideas of avant-garde activists. The creations of the directors of the Russian avant-garde are also associated with the Asian theme. Eurasian ideas soaked up Soviet directors' minds and translated into culture, as well as into cinematic culture. Representatives of Russian avant-garde including D. Vetrov associated with futurists, LEF magazine and representatives of formal school, who in their turn were connected with Eurasians (R. Yakobson, for example). Eurasian teachings and avant-garde representatives' perceptions have common roots to be highlighted in Russian history. The scientific novelty of this study which involved comparative method is due to identifying similarities between them.

AB A comprehensive analysis of various kinds of socio-philosophical literature concerning the issue of our compatriots who ended up abroad of their homeland against their will allowed us to single out the factors and conditions determining the essence of Russian culture and its significance for a person who became a migrant. This also made it possible to find answers to some questions related to their fate, as well as to see and realize the depth of loss for the present and future Russia due to the loss of representatives of Russian culture. We carried out a comparison and analysis of two historical situations associated with the forced migration of Russian-speaking (1917-1930) and Russian compatriots who came to be hostages to Russian politics (1991-2000). Many aspects and factors intrinsic to ethnic Russians living on the territory of the former republics of the Soviet Union (after 1991) have been identified, which led the authors to realize the presence of deep ethnic sociocultural mechanisms defining the meaning and values of their existential world, find expression in the socio-political and cultural position of many representatives of the Russian community. The emerging negative trend for Russia associated with the loss of the Russian-speaking population continues these days; there is an active and, "voluntary" "drain" of them abroad. This fact is highly alarming and causes great concern to a greater extent among the country's scientists than among its leadership. The comprehensive research carried out by the authors was also supplemented by the results of a sociological survey of compatriots living abroad regarding their understanding of the concept of "Russian culture". The results obtained made for developing provisions concerning the problems of Russian-speaking people living outside the borders of their motherland, which can be used in further scientific research, as well as for the development of state and public programs in this area.

TI Aleksandr Nikitenko's Private Library as a "Chronicle of Russian
   Literature"

DT Article
DE private library; history of Russian literature; chronicle; Aleksandr
   Nikitenko
AB The article aims to actualize the heritage of Aleksandr Nikitenko, which is the synthesis of his diary and his private library as the laboratory of mental life, and to analyze the way Nikitenko considered Russian chronicles, as well as the degree of their influence on the professor's cultural and historical views. In the history of literature of the pre-revolutionary and Soviet times, Nikitenko was regarded mainly as the author of his diary, which for many years had been considered as the vital source of data of the Russian literature of the 1820s-1870s. At the same time, Nikitenko's research and official activities remained unfairly underestimated by the scholars of the past as being ordinary and unremarkable. Today, there appear studies that highly evaluate Nikitenko's activities in terms of the cultural-historical and aesthetic-literary context of the 19th century. For Nikitenko, the library became the basis on which he built his idea of the world aesthetic and philosophical thought. He formed his professional ideas under the conditions of the creation of Russian literary criticism, changes in the censorship regime, and the sharp change in the political position of the Russian government. Nikitenko compiled his private library while he was developing as a professor of literature at Saint Petersburg University, a critic of Russian literature, and a censor. The article proves that Nikitenko regarded the keeping of the diary and the compiling of the library through the concept of the chronicle. In the study, this concept is presented as a kind of a communicative model, which Nikitenko applied consciously to define himself as the chronicler of Russian literature. The study is based on the systematic method that combines library science and the history of literature for the analysis of various sections of the book collection, for the investigation of common elements in Nikitenko's diary and texts. Nikitenko's library contains publications of chronicles and historical documents, as well as research of historians, including that of his contemporaries whom Nikitenko knew personally. Nikitenko needed the chronicle material to create a new periodization of Russian literature, with its origins from chronicle sources. At that time, teaching was mostly based on Western doctrines, and the problem was to form a coherent idea of the course of Russian literary history. Nikitenko was one of the first to solve the issue of periodization in a historical way. He did not deal specifically with chronicles as a historian; he focused his interest on the ways historical figures were presented in literature, on the images of Nestor the Chronicler, Ivan the Terrible, and others. Collecting chronicles in his library, he used them as sources to investigate verbal expressions of the ideas and mental life of the Russian person rather than facts of the past. Nikitenko was developing his own concept of considering the history of Russian literature, which was delivered in the periodization he proposed, as well as in his articles and university lectures.

DT Article
DE democracy; totalitarianism; political regime; Russia; Yeltsin; Putin
AB This article discusses the question of why a Western-style democracy has not been formed in Russia. The prerequisite for the formation of a democracy as a political regime is the domination of small and medium-sized private property and a middle class. Since the middle class has been small in Russia throughout most of its history for a number of objective reasons, the country has hardly known full-fledged democracy, and the current political system only imitates it. Russia's attempts to enter the trajectory of democratic development-both in the early twentieth century, and since the early 1990s-have failed, and the trend of abandoning the basic principles of democracy has prevailed over the past two decades. The blame for this lies not only on the current Russian leadership but to no lesser extent on the political leadership of the West, which for the sake of short-term self- serving interests or political ambitions has contributed much to the formation of the current Russian regime.

DE trust; labor migration; international trade; economic growth; basic

AB The review is devoted to the book by 2019 Nobel laureates in Economics Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee, published in Russian by the Gaidar Institute Publishing House in 2021. Building upon the crisis of confidence in economists, the authors in the microeconomic plane reflect upon a set of effective tools for combating poverty in economic science. The book focuses on the following topics: trust, migration, trade, economic growth, technological progress, the role of the state in the economy, and basic income. Duflo and Banerjee consider real situations within the framework of these topics, using the method of natural experiments, in order to show the inconsistency and lack of fundamental basis in numerous stereotypes of economic policy. Technological progress is useful for high-tech industries in terms of creating jobs and saving public funds, but for the rest of the labor market it may destroy jobs and lead to increasing social insecurity of citizens with low incomes. It is the consideration of the program theses of economic science on trust, migration, trade, technological progress and welfare from the perspective of socially vulnerable population segments that determines the uniqueness of the study. Since the work touches on disparate areas, it also has a number of drawbacks, which are mentioned in the review. In particular, the idea of a natural experiment is not followed by a political economy generalization, which is a disadvantage of the work.

AB Research objectives: The article scrutinizes the arguments challenging the urban status of the Kuchum settlement (Isker), the capital of the Siberian Khanate. The author analyzes the available data on the vicinity, population, trading, and craft production of this capital.
   Research materials: The main sources are materials obtained during archaeological research in the ancient settlement in the twentieth and twenty-first century, as well as artifacts collected on the shallows of the Irtysh River from the destroyed cultural layer of the monument since the 1880s. The cartographic materials of S.U. Remezov, V. Filimonov, and V.N. Pignatti were also used in the study.
   Results and novelty of the research: An analysis of the available data showed that the area of the monument reached at least 2.6 hectares by the late fifteenth century. In addition, archaeological research by A.P. Zykov and the author revealed a complex multi-level fortification system aimed at defending the capital of the Siberian Khanate. The artifacts found in 2019 suggest the presence of oversize brick structures in the capital. Such artifacts prove the important role of Isker as the center of trade located on the most convenient route which connected Central Asia, China, Eastern Europe, and the taiga regions of Western Siberia. The population of the settlement widely used silver and copper coins in trading. The collected data show that blacksmiths, casters, jewelers, tailors, and tanners lived and worked in Isker. A huge cultural layer, rich in artifacts, of the Kuchum settlement could be formed only by a fairly large population by Siberian standards, consisting of the khan's family and its servants, close members of the nobility, Muslim clergy, warriors, merchants, and artisans. The total available data allows us to consider Isker as the political, commercial, craft, and religious center of the Siberian Tatars.

AB The article explores the institutional aspect of the incorporation of the peoples of the Central Caucasus into the political and legal space of the Russian Empire on the example of the activities of the Mozdok Upper Border Court (1793-1822). Among the main areas of such incorporation, the court considers the application of Russian normative acts in decision-making, the legitimization of concluded and the certification of concluded contracts and transactions, the recognition and consolidation of the social status of representatives of the local population, and the use of institutions of justice unusual to the traditional legal consciousness of the highlanders. Attention is drawn to the formation of socionormative pluralism in the region, when the norms of adat, Muslim and Russian law were applied in resolving disputes and conflicts.Issues related to difficulties of inter-language communication of the court with subordinate institutions are considered. Examples of the issuance of mortgage letters by the court are considered as a guarantee of the fulfillment of property obligations assumed by the participants in the proceedings. Information is given on the introduction of the institution of attorneys in the practice of the border court. It is concluded that all this was one of the mechanisms for subsequently forming the origins of Russian civic identity among representatives of the local population.

AB Introduction. The author presents a brief description of the situation in the South Caucasus after the establishment of the Soviet power in Azerbaijan. A brief characteristic of the international context influencing decision-making in relation to Georgia and Armenia is given. The author makes a short review of historiography. Methods and materials. A list of historical sources is presented. The materials of the Archive of foreign policy of the Russian Federation and the Russian state archive of social and political history, private documents and the description of Menshevik Georgia in 1920 by Soviet scientist and publicist N.L. Meshcheryakov are the base of the research. Analysis. Based on these sources, the author explores the Soviet-Georgian relations, which are considered as interstate, since Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic legally accepted the independence of the Georgian state. A comparison of the positions of the representatives of the Caucasus Bureau and the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs revealed the difference in approaches to politics in Georgia. Moscow was against forced Sovietization and considered the Georgian Republic as a temporary buffer between Russia, on the one hand, and the forces of the Entente and Kemalist Turkey, on the other. The main directions of the Soviet-Georgian interaction were analyzed. The author, giving examples from documents, proves that Georgia was used as a center for strengthening control over Azerbaijan, consolidating success in the North Caucasus and pursuing a policy of reintegrating the South Caucasus into the Russian statehood. One of the clauses of the Soviet-Georgian treaty signed in May 1920 was the creation of an associated commission. The article considers the features of its work and shows its inefficiency using the documents. Results. The author draws the conclusion that achieving independence in a wide international context was impossible for Georgia at that date. The RSFSR policy during 1920-1921 can be called the course of postponed Sovietization. It became an independent stage in the reintegration of the South Caucasus.

DE Alexander von Humboldt; Science Policy
AB In conditions of deep social differentiation, science, apparently, is not capable of internal integration. As a result, it cannot fully participate in political life as an independent and equal subject. Turning to the figure of Alexander von Humboldt, the author reconstructs a certain "workaround" of the possible influence of scientists on politics and science management. The importance of the Humboldt brothers for world science in general and Russia, in particular, can hardly be overestimated. Alexander von Humboldt was a specialist in the widest range of disciplines: astronomy, geology, mineralogy, chemistry, biology, and many others. He stood at the origins of modern geography. Today he is called the herald of globalized science. At the same time, during his journey, the first world global network of scientific research was finally completed, the famous network of geological stations, which made it possible to simultaneously record natural and climatic changes in Europe, Russia, and the United States. Today, in an age of fatal environmental change, this endeavor's relevance has finally become common knowledge. The article proposes the idea of the possibility of a mutually beneficial "rational exchange" between science and politics, which is interpreted by the author in the systemic-communicative concept of "structural conjugation".

ID PARADOX
AB The article is a response to a work by Vsevolod Ladov, which is devoted to the discussion of the views of the "early" Wittgenstein on the problem of logical paradoxes. It follows from Ladov's work that Wittgenstein's position, preceding the TLP period, is the most radical version of the hierarchical approach, which has a more significant argumentation potential than Russell's theory of logical types. According to Ladov, taking into account the spatial-graphic syntax model proposed by Wittgenstein, problems associated with self-referential identities should be resolved without any additional theoretical study. In contrast to the criticism of the theory of types, criticism of the theory of types in the works of the "early" Wittgenstein is of a different nature. It focuses not on the denial of the theory of types itself, but on the fact that its postulation turns out to be simply redundant for the logical-theoretical analysis. This article provides a number of arguments against the thesis Ladov defends. It is shown that the foundations of Wittgenstein's theory of symbolism do not correlate with the operation of the principles it establishes: none of the possible interpretations of this theory can avoid the need for hierarchical typology.

AB The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has convincingly shown that the very concept of security is going through a deep transformation in the 21st century. Widespread epidemics, massive illegal migration, international terrorism, environmental disasters, new forms of nationalism, cyber technology, and scarce resources challenge the traditional military threats that have always been at the center of theinternational community's attention. Undoubtedly, in the list of new non-military threats, the pandemic initiated by the coronavirus came to the fore, which raised the question of rethinking the very concept of security. The article analyzes the phenomenon of pandemic and security nexus, as well as the consequences of this phenomenon for the functioning of the European Union and its member states. In particular, the author examines the threats posed by the pandemic to human security or the foundations of human life, economic security, socio-political stability, and, ultimately, to the future of European integration. The author argues that the EU's response to the devastating consequences of the coronavirus will be a test of its viability as a unique integration association capable of becoming a full-fledged power center in post-pandemic international relations. The title of the article "EU Security: Micro-aggression with Macro Consequences" is metaphorical and intended to highlight the misleading perception of the scale of the new non-military threat.

   digital technologies
AB Modern technological, informational and social processes, especially rapidly occurring in the current situation of growing complexity and uncertainty, lead to the need to adjust the established patterns of behavior and forms of communication in various sociocultural environments. Many of these processes are already unthinkable outside of digital reality. The relevance of issues related to the development, testing, implementation and application of digital services and technologies is increasing in the changing world under the influence of total shocks, in particular the coronavirus pandemic. The social sphere, in the broadest sense of this concept, is undergoing global changes: local and total self-isolation, the "closure" of borders and territories, the remote nature of learning, work, shopping, and service provision force modern science and technology to develop at an even faster pace, increasing the digital shell. In this regard, the functioning of all socio-anthropological systems becomes impossible outside the digital format, which means that digital technologies are already given as a modern stage of civilizational development. Despite the clear necessity and proven positive effect, digital technologies have a range of real and potential risks and threats that accompany almost every opportunity they provide. Risks and threats are especially pronounced when assessing long-term prospects, in particular, in strategic planning and socio-humanitarian forecasting. Among the real and potential risks and threats, one can note social degradation; risks of autism; loss of empathy in the digital generation; reduced ability to analyze information and make decisions, and transfer of these functions to artificial intelligence; reduction in the number of jobs; technical legal, ethical lack of preparation of society; cyber crimes; etc. How can the risks of digital technologies be avoided or minimized? This is a deliberate introduction of "digital hygiene", "digital diet", the systematic and gradual introduction of new technologies so that there is a real opportunity not only to assess risks, but also to manage them. The authors emphasize that the introduction of digital technologies into social reality is possible only under the control of systems of socio-technical expertise, in the process of constant monitoring of the changing landscapes of the anthropotechnosphere, exclusively with the priority of observance of laws, ethical norms, individual rights, and the well-grounded welfare of society.

DE Slavs; Turks; ethnic history; identities; nagaybaks
AB Slavic-Turkic contacts were of great importance in the panorama of the ethnic history of Eurasia. In the XVI-XIX cc. the Turks of Russia were involved in ethnic processes, the results of which were the emergence of new identities. The purpose of the article is to determine the reasons, mechanisms and logic of such processes using the example of the Nagaybaks - the Turkic people of the Southern Urals. The material offered to the reader has been prepared on the basis of the author's research and literature of the XVIII-XX cc. The genesis of this identity is associated with Russian influences on the Turks in political, social and cultural aspects. After the victory over Kazan, the state task was to ensure the protection of new borders and security in new territories. The strategy consisted in the formation of a population loyal to the Russian authorities through Christianization, estate building and administrative reforms. As a result of mass Christianization, a new identity appeared - the baptized Tatars. The authorities have had some success. The baptized Tatars did not support the Bashkir uprisings. In the XVIII c., part of the baptized Tatars, together with the Russians, entered the Orenburg Cossack Army. Now they have become socially isolated and adopted a new identity - the estate one. By the name of the Nagaybakskaya fortress, they were called Nagaybaks. In 1843, together with the Russian Cossacks, they were resettled on the Southern Urals. Russians were in the majority here, and they perceived the Nagaybaks not so much as Cossacks or Christians, but as another people speaking an incomprehensible language with their own culture. However, the Nagaybak-Russian contacts intensified. In the XIX.., under Russian influence, they became a people with an original complex of culture. The state carried out the administrative structure of the Nagaybaks. In the XVIII c., Muslims were resettled from them, and the settlements were administratively united with Russians. This strengthened their confessional and estate identity. In the XIX c. their villages, being close to each other, were subordinate to different Russian administrations. This ensured both intra-group family ties and helped to get closer to the Russians. In 1926 and 1927, the population census for the first time recorded them as an ethnic group, and the Nagaybak district was formed. The people received official recognition and ethnic territory, delineated by the administrative boundary. The history of the Nagaybaks is an example of how a new people can arise in a short period. It appeared thanks to the influence of the Russian administration on the Turkic population of the Volga region and the Urals, through the strengthening of state security and social reforms in new territories.

AB The paper explores the current peculiarities of the relations between the Black Sea littoral states (Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Georgia and Turkey) with the consideration of the coronavirus pandemic that has changed the ways of the external interaction. The author analyses the role of the Black Sea region in the political discourse of each littoral state and defines the trends of the economic and military-political interaction between the Black Sea states. It is shown that the pandemic has not led to the alleviation of the confrontation between the littoral states amidst the new common challenge. Neither has it stimulated them to reassess the current challenges and threats to maritime security. On the contrary, during the fight against the pandemic the conflicting nature of their interaction exacerbated under the conditions of the absence of the united strategic basis developed by the littoral states for their policy in the Black Sea region since the collapse of the USSR in 1991. The aspiration of Ukraine and Georgia to obtain military-political advantages in the Black Sea area prevailed with the support of the non-regional actors.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE world-class university; global university rankings; competitiveness;
   geopolitical inversion
AB The article considers the results of the third wave of identification of world-class universities in 2021, obtained on the basis of the authors' methodology. The comparison of the new results with the data for the 2017 and 2019 allowed us to examine in more detail some well-established mental stereotypes of a geopolitical and national character. In particular, the role of the North American university center is declining, but the universities of the United States and Canada are still models for the rest of the world, both in terms of the breadth of scientific diversification and in terms of the research results obtained. The seemingly self-evident "decline of Europe" concerning the market of advanced universities is not confirmed. Moreover, there is reason to talk about the growing activity of the European geopolitical center, whose universities not only hold their positions but also rapidly increase the number of highly specialized institutions and are at the forefront of training personnel for postindustrial society. Contrary to many expectations, the Asian university market is still far from becoming a distinctive authentic phenomenon and is still only an example of a relatively successful "copying model" of Western models. Quite unexpected was the alarming conclusion about the superiority of advanced universities in Latin America over universities in the post-soviet space in general and in Russia in particular. It is shown that the recognition of "new" world-class universities by international rating agencies, such as the National Autonomous University of Mexico, is very late. The internal Russian mental archetype concerning the model of development of the Lomonosov Moscow State University is recognized as untenable, whose tenure as a member of world-class universities is extremely unstable. Additional proof of this is the fact that this university has already lost the competition in the direction of "political science" to two other Russian universities - the HSE University and the MGIMO University.

DE Ladislaus II of Poland; Battle of Grunwald; Polish-Lithuanian
   Commonwealth; Teutonic Order; representations
AB This article deals with Polish representations of Wladyslaw II Jagiello, Grand Duke of Lithuania, ruler of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom, founder of the Jagiellonian dynasty. Research on representations of the past has become one of the main fields of memory studies in recent years. They allow us to look at historical events and their emblematic protagonists through the prism of their successive emanations. The kaleidoscope of images of the past reflects changes in social awareness and collective memory of a given political community. Jagiello and the Battle of Grunwald (1410), which is inseparably associated with his reign, offer a model case in point. Among the numerous representations of Jagiello, those created in the nineteenth century have made a lasting impression. At first, they took the form of literary works and paintings, and only later did they appear in political journalism and historiography. With time, they transmogrified into grass-roots commemorative initiatives, the most spectacular manifestation of which was the jubilee of the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald, celebrated in Krakow in 1910. The works of Jozef Ignacy Kraszewski, Henryk Sienkiewicz and Jan Matejko fulfilled their role and became part of the canon, on which the Polish imagination depended from then on, regardless of the changing political configurations. In this way, Jagiello became one of the most important figures in the pantheon of rulers, while the distant historical experience of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was permanently grafted onto and modelled the Polish political imagination. This observation is also confirmed by his twentieth-century portrayals in Polish films and historical series.

AB The article deals with the problems of new social and political divisions associated with the widespread use of information and communication technologies (ICT) by inhabitants of megacities and city administrations. The author considers different approaches to the conceptualization of "digital divides" and to the study of their socio-political consequences, analyzes the main dimensions and levels of digital divide in the context of current socio-political processes and development trends, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, and considers different approaches to overcome them in a modern megacity. Three main levels of digital divide in modern societies are identified and characterized: 1) the availability of the material basis for the use of digital technology (technical level); 2) the skills for its use by different people (social level); and 3) the real opportunities for full participation of the individual in the life of a modern "digital" society and democratic participation in political and social processes, including the realization of their civil rights and freedoms, in expanding social connections and relations (political level). It is shown that while these three "traditional" types of digital gaps - inequalities in access to ICT, in the level of digital skills and in the possibility of full participation in the political life of modern digital society - remain and grow in importance in the megacity context, their new aspects, such as access to big data sets (Big Data), the degree of dependence on automated decision-making systems (algorithms) using artificial intelligence technologies, and digital exclusion and separation on the relational level are becoming increasingly important. Some socio-political implications of the new digital divide and the associated political risks are identified. It is concluded that the measures taken to mitigate and reduce the digital divide in the modern metropolis have so far been mostly partial and palliative, with a focus on improving the material basis for the use of digital technologies rather than on overcoming the deeper sociopolitical causes and consequences of digital divisions and gaps. It is shown that policies to reduce the digital divide and digital inequality in modern megacities are particularly important because megacities are home to the most politically active populations.

AB The history of the left opposition in the CPSU(b) is mainly represented in historiography by works devoted to the internal party struggle in the highest echelons of power (Politburo, Central Committee, etc.). However, a characteristic feature of the political clashes of the 1920s is the involvement of the broad party masses in the conflict, who tried to present their own point of view on the prospects of the development of the socialist revolution. Therefore, one of the most promising directions in the study of the political history of this period is the exploration of the peculiarities of confrontation at the grassroots level, i.e. in certain regions or in spheres of social, cultural and economic life. The purpose of this article is to reconstruct the struggle of the left opposition at Leningrad University, one of the largest scientific centers in the country. The author determines the number of oppositionists, their leaders among university teachers, as well as the main strategies of struggle. Special attention is paid to the further destinies of oppositionists. One of the main observations of the article is that the tactics of suppressing opposition at the university largely coincided with that used in the central apparatus of the country. The author has established that students played an important role in the activities of the opposition. They were responsible for distributing opposition literature, collecting signatures for the political platform, etc. Propaganda activities were revived in the form of pre-revolutionary circles organized at the university and at industrial enterprises in order to agitate among students and workers.

An analysis of historiography demonstrates that the most diametrical interpretations of this event are presented in the literature: Nikolai acted under pressure from M. A. Miloradovich and/or Maria Fedorovna, together with the Governor-General and/or Empress Mother. An important aspect of the work is the study of the normative component of the problem of succession. It is shown that by November 1825 a contradictory situation had developed: by law the heir was Konstantin, by family agreement - Nikolai. The article justifiably proves that the Manifesto of Alexander I on the transfer of the throne of Nicholas was a model of separate family law and was never supposed to be published. On the basis of a wide range of sources, the article reconstructs the course of meetings on November 25, describes the features of taking the oath on November 27, and reveals the development of the dynastic crisis arising from them. It is demonstrated that Nicholas had a complex plan to seize power, which implied unification with representatives of the generals and the highest bureaucracy, an oath in favor of Konstantin in violation of the established tradition, pressure on his older brother and, ultimately, the proclamation of emperor. The article presents the question of rumors spread in St. Petersburg society related to the secession of Poland and the hypothetical murder of Constantine.

DE theory of war; pre-revolutionary Russia; war as a political phenomenon;
   strategy; methodology and method
AB Introduction. The article explores the conceptualization of war as a political phenomenon in prerevolutionary Russia and presents its results for theory and practice. For this purpose, the article studies and interprets the origins of political ideas about war, the occurrence of political content in its scientific understanding, the emergence and development of various paradigms for its understanding as a political phenomenon and the conceptualization of Russia's superior strategy. Methods and methodology. The research methodology is based on political realism and the recognition of war as an actual phenomenon. The choice of works for analysis stems from the connection of their content with political issues. The article studies political situations and processes that caused the enhancement of research into war as a political phenomenon. Analysis. The first political perceptions of the phenomenon of war began taking shape in Russia in the second half of the 17th century and they reveal an understanding of the link between war and politics. The formation of the knowledge system about war and military activities took place without political understanding and contained a significant element of borrowing from outside. In relation to the formation of the science of war, there was also a theoretical understanding of its political content. In the second third of the 19th century scientific discussions began, in which two approaches based on the decision to recognize the political content of war were formed. Eventually, an approach that essentially negates the primacy of political institutions prevailed in military science and in the education of military personnel, which had negative consequences for theory and practice. Results. The study of war as a political phenomenon in pre-revolutionary Russia formed dialectical and metaphysical approaches with the latter dominating and being followed by representatives of official military science. It can be stated that there is a problem of method in the study of war, which is manifested in modern conditions.

DE deontic logic; dynamic propositional logic; normative characteristics of
   actions; deontic universe; Kislov
AB In a series of recent papers, Kislov introduced a number of new normative characteristics of actions - permissible in the strict sense (in what follows I write 'strictly' instead of 'in the strict sense'), strictly forbidden, strictly obligatory, strictly indifferent, recommending-indifferent, and warning-indifferent. He defined them, in particular, in the context of a deontic version of propositional dynamic logic with a symbol for 'sanction' as the only propositional constant (in what follows, this logic will be referred to as PDL). He also suggested a map of deontic universe representing extensions of the standard and the new normative characteristics of actions. I find his characteristics of actions interesting because they reflect some intuitive normative ideas that are not reflected by standard characteristics. In this paper I examine the semantics of PDL and Kislov's map of deontic universe, and show that both should be corrected in some respects. First, I show that, in order for a PDL model to be deontically relevant, the following restriction on models should be imposed: in each PDL model <W, V>, V(nu) is a nonempty proper subclass of W. Second, I examine Kislov's map of deontic universe and point out three erroneous tenets behind it: 1) There are strictly indifferent actions. 2) Each strictly obligatory action is also strictly permissible (equivalently: each strictly forbidden action is such that not-performing it is strictly permissible). 3) Each (standardly) indifferent action is either warning-indifferent or recommending-indifferent. I conclude that the map of deontic universe should be corrected taking into account the following facts: 1) In models meeting the above restriction, there is no strictly indifferent action. 2) An action can be strictly obligatory without being strictly permissible, and equivalently an action can be strictly forbidden whereas not-performing it is not strictly permissible. 3) An action can be (standardly) indifferent without being warning-indifferent or recommending-indifferent. I also adduce some new examples of using Kislov's characteristics of actions for formalizing intuitive normative ideas.

DE Russell; Wittgenstein; type theory; theory of symbolism; formal
   language; Liar paradox; self-reference
AB In his article "Criticism of the Theory of Types in the Early Wittgenstein's Philosophy", Vsevolod Ladov attributes the following two claims, inter alia, to Russell: (1) Some sentences of natural language, such as "This sentence is false", are paradoxical. (2) The existence of paradoxical sentences is a flaw of natural language that should be fixed. According to Ladov, these claims motivated the development of the theory of types by Whitehead and Russell, so this theory was worked out as a tool for improving natural language. Ladov contrasts this position with the early Wittgenstein's theory of symbolism according to which paradoxes cannot be formulated in natural language because the intrinsic logical syntax of natural language makes this impossible. Ladov concludes that Wittgenstein's theory of symbolism is a more radical version of hierarchical approach to paradoxes than Whitehead and Russell's theory of types. I challenge attribution of (1) and (2) to Russell and show that the type theory by Whitehead and Russell, on the one hand, and Wittgenstein's theory of symbolism, on the other hand, share the following claims: 1) The hierarchical logical syntax preventing self-referential expressions is intrinsic to natural language. 2) Since self-reference is a necessary condition of paradoxes like the Liar paradox, they cannot be formulated in natural language. 3) The paradoxical character of sentences like "This sentence is false" is an illusion. The conjunction of these claims can be named the "Russell-Wittgenstein theory of symbolism". So I also challenge Ladov's claim that there is a deep difference between these theories with respect to the problem of paradoxes. Finally, I challenge two tenets from Wittgenstein's Tractatus that are frequently reproduced in literature: the tenet that the theory of types depends on semantics and the tenet that the theory of types is confined to the prevention of self-reference.

DE Orthodox church and international law; M. V. Zyzykin; law and religion;

AB The article discusses the ideas of Mikhail V. Zyzykin (1880-1960) about the contribution of the Church to international law in the context of its history and the international relations in the 1930s. Special attention is paid to the relation of Orthodoxy to international law, since Zyzykin is one of the few jurists who have studied in detail the influence of the Orthodox Church tradition on the law of nations. His works on this subject (first of all, an essay The Church and International Law (1937), based on a report at the Oxford conference of practical Christianity in 1937), remain little known to social and political science. The article considers the main provisions of Zyzykin about the origin of international law in medieval Europe with the participation of the Church in the context of the positions of other international lawyers (Taube, Martens, Kamarovsky, Nys, Bluntschli). It contains a comparative characteristic of the attitude to international law of the three Christian denominations (Catholicism, Protestantism, and Orthodoxy) according to Zyzykin and his idea of the Christian West and East "asymmetric" international contribution (the East was represented initially by the Eastern Roman Empire, and then by the Russian Empire). The fourth part describes the most original part of Zyzykin's ideological legacy: a comparison of two vulnerable attempts of international organization, the Holy Alliance in the XIX century and the League of Nations in the XX century.

SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Apocalypse; eschatology; political theology; millenarianism; liberalism;
   Marxism; conservatism
AB This article outlines various concepts of the Apocalypse and their relationship to such political ideas of modernity as socialism, liberalism and conservatism. Eschatology is based on the idea that time is striving to elaborate itself and fulfil its own meaning and is therefore directly related to the concept of history as the link between the present, past and future. Different versions of the Apocalypse have become the basis for certain political perspectives: the aspiration to eradicate the old world and establish the Kingdom of God is related to the ambitions of emancipatory and revolutionary movements, while liberalism derives its coherence from a Kantian ethics in which the eschatological assumption provides the foundation for personal moral autonomy. However, the attempts of revolutionaries to realize the meaning of history and the eschatological "fulfilment of time" have become a key element in the criticism of emancipatory movements by conservatives.
   Contrary to the widespread idea that eschatological expectation and politics are opposed, the author argues that the very notion of politics is impossible without addressing certain concepts from the Apocalypse. The similarity of their eschatological tropes should not be taken as a suggestion that socialist, conservative or liberal ideas (which continue to be in a state of fundamental conflict) may possibly converge; but it does indicate a deep connection between politics as such and the notion of the end of time. These foundations of the political are now threatened by a post-politics associated with the disappearance of the experience of time-an "eternal present" in which the multitude of catastrophes we constantly experience devalues each of them as a unique event and inscribes the idea of the Apocalypse in the reproduction of the existing order of things.

AB The article considers representative viewpoints and arguments of German universities' faculty and management regarding some problems the present-day German Academia have been facing. The author compares these problems with challenges of the Russian higher education in the context of scientific communication. The major difference between German humanities professors and their Russian counterparts is a lack of systematic communication mechanisms even within the professional community, insufficient interdisciplinary connections and a weak public role of the intellectuals. It is for this reason that Russian scholars find it difficult to get incorporated into the international knowledge market, and to insist on their field's specific character - namely, qualitative assessment, publications in their mother tongue and publishing traditional monographies. The author outlines structural elements of successful scientific communication and regards its problems in Russia and Germany in the context of the global knowledge market, global competition and a new industrial revolution caused by the total digitalization and automatization. The article also focuses on the third mission of universities which refers to their faculty's public activity, accessibility of their research results in the mass media, the scope of their public discussion and tangible impact on social and political institutions, industry and business. The author pays special attention to the evaluation criteria in philosophical, sociological and humanitarian disciplines, and to their specific nature compared to other research and education fields (i.e. IT).

AB The article is devoted to the study of the phenomenon of meritocracy, which arouses considerable interest today both in political journalism and academia. The article shows that meritocracy has largely become the ideology of modern neoliberal elites, and therefore often serves as a cover for the actual plutocracy. Although the framework of cognitive capitalism witnesses a certain movement towards meritocratic principles of the formation of elites, it simultaneously prepares ground for the emergence of a kind of "trap of meritocracy", when, for a number of reasons, the layer of "educated and talented" turns into a hereditary caste.
   At the same time, according to the author, the future hardly belongs to meritocrats, no matter how well they fit into the realities of the high-tech economy. New developments in artificial intelligence are jeopardizing many forms of intellectual work, leading to a cut-throat competition for a decreasing number of high-paying jobs. In turn, the bourgeois world of labor is being replaced by a post-capitalist world of idleness and creativity as the production of intangible goods. The rapid development of social media makes emotional and social intelligence, as well as the ability to achieve popularity and influence through media activities, increasingly important. In other words, modern technology makes life difficult for cognitive elites, while opening up enormous opportunities for very different social groups. In this regard, the author puts forward a hypothesis according to which popularity will become a key criterion for the formation of elites in the foreseeable future rather than merit. Post-capitalist personocracy will gradually replace bourgeois meritocracy, which, however, does not exclude the possibility of the preservation of the myth of meritocracy, implying that those who can skillfully attract attention will be assigned various merits.

DE Belozersk monasteries; the crisis in Russia in the last third of the

   abbot of the Belozersk Monastery Matthew
AB Introduction. The article examines the situation of the monasteries of the Belozersk region in the last quarter of the 16th century - the first decade of the 17th century: regional manifestation of crisis phenomena, the reasons for their occurrence, the degree of influence of individual factors (epidemic, famine, foreign invasion). Methods and materials. The topic is disclosed using the methods of historical research (analysis, synthesis, external and internal criticism of documents). The source base was made up of acts and monastic business books, including inventory of property. Analysis. In the last quarter of the 16th century - the first decade of the 17th century the Russian state was going through a deep crisis, which was observed in all aspects of the life of Russian society: political, dynastic, economic and social; it was intensified by the great famine of 1601-1603. During these years monasteries remained centers of economic stability, providing the brethren, servants, ministers and beggars with the necessary products and household items. In the years of famine, grain from the monastic granaries was "loaned" to the peasants for consumption and sowing. The devastation of the monastic economy and the physical destruction of the population began in the Time of Troubles. As a result, the authors came to the following conclusions: the crisis of the last quarter of the 16th century and the Great Famine of the early 17th century did not lead to degradation and disruption of the traditional way of life in the region; the destruction of Belozersk monasteries begins in 1612 and continues until 1618; only the Kirillov Monastery, headed by Abbot Matthew, was able to organize the defense and protect the fortress, preserving the Cyril's heritage from the Polish-Cossack plunder.

ID DEMOCRACY
AB In the article, we characterize the dispute on the agenda as a type of non-thematic communication, show its specifics, analyze its relationship with the thematic dispute. We also describe the ways of assessing the results of the dispute on the agenda, to present the positions of agents in relation to their strategies and risks. These questions are illustrated by the analysis of dispute on the Internet. We made the following conclusions. Agenda disputes, or non-thematic disputes, are ubiquitous in communication. They are more about a conflict of interest than a divergence of opinion. Such disputes carry risks for the status of the participants, since, unlike in thematic disputes, the resolution of the dispute on the agenda determines who and according to what rules will dispute about the subject. This, firstly, outlines the range of options for its solution; secondly, this often predetermines them; and, thirdly, due to the adoption by the parties of the rules, this reduces the social distance between them, discursively equalizes their rights. The integral assessment of the agenda dispute arises as a combination of assessments on four scales reflecting four aspects of the dispute: epistemic, actional, interactional, and public. The main role here is played by the aspects of interaction and publicity. This circumstance is associated both with the historically established forms of public deliberation and with the communicative methods of unelected representatives and actionists, who achieve the most significant results in disputes on the agenda, namely, the recognition of their political subjectivity. There are logical-pragmatic relations between the dispute on the agenda and the related thematic dispute, on the basis of which it is possible to ascribe the positions of the agents in the dispute on the agenda that reflect their attitude to resolving the dispute, their strategies of behavior and risks. Eight such positions were identified, which made it possible, in particular, to clarify the essence of actionism as an attack on the indifferent position of the counterparty, to identify the properties of an agent for whom, on the contrary, no communication is acceptable, to describe the features of various forms of promoting and blocking topics and arguments in non-thematic and thematic disputes. An analysis of examples showed that reaching a non-thematic level is a frequent and productive maneuver in a dispute that undermines interaction, and blocking it, regardless of the course of a thematic dispute, brings the agent success, primarily in the aspect of publicity.

AB The aim of the article is a socio-philosophical analysis of the theoretical and methodological foundations of the discursive representation of urban identity in the scientific works of domestic and foreign authors. The following tasks were set and solved in the work: (1) analysis of theoretical and methodological approaches to understanding the city in philosophy; (2) analysis of existing approaches to the philosophical conceptualization of urban space as a living environment; (3) analysis of existing approaches to the conceptualization of the concept "city space" as a construct of places significant for citizens; (4) nalysis of existing approaches to the conceptualization of the concepts "place" and "non-place" of the city. To solve the problem associated with the study of theoretical and methodological approaches to understanding the city, the following theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of the problem were analyzed: social constructionism (P. Berger, T. Lukman, M. Foucault); critical discourse analysis (N. Fairclough); humanitarian geography (D.N. Zamyatin, I.I. Mitin); geographical hermeneutics (H.-G. Gadamer, V.L. Kagansky, I.N. Kornev); ecoanthropocentric paradigm (T. Dridze). The study analyzes the main approaches to the study of the city that are relevant for modern social philosophy: the functional approach (H. Lefebvre, L. Mumford, J. Habermas); the socio-cultural or environmental approach (V.L. Glazychev, T. Dridze). In the part of the article devoted to solving the problem of conceptualizing the concept "city space", the results of the socio-philosophical analysis of the theory of social space based on the works of P. Bourdieu (the concept "social space" and the principle of vision and separation of spaces developed by him), H. Lefebvre (the concept of space reproduction), M. Foucault (the concept "disciplinary space") are presented. When solving the problem, to address the existing approaches to the conceptualization of the notions "place" and "non-place" of the city, the article presents an analysis of the points of view of domestic and foreign authors, divided us into two groups: (1) M. Auge, D. Harvey, G.Z. Hagan (the place of the city as the connecting link between the physical space of the city and citizens) and (2) B.I. Serov, M. Castells (place as the point in space that passes through flows and movements, it does not have to be historical, identifying, binding, or authentic). The research material presented in the article allows forming a holistic understanding of the philosophy of the city as an independent philosophical direction, clarifying and detailing the theoretical and methodological resources of the theory of perception of urban space and representation of urban identity in order to find answers to topical questions in modern urban space research. The conclusions and materials presented in the work can be used in the preparation of lecture courses on the philosophy of the city and the phenomenology of space, theoretical urban studies, writing textbooks in the designated areas and conducting subsequent theoretical research.

DT Article
DE environmental policy; environmental civic engagement; stakeholder
   interaction; simulation; performance
AB Based on the analysis of documents, a series of expert interviews with different city stakeholders (n = 60), and a representative survey of the population of the cities of Moscow and Kazan (n = 1500), the authors provide insights on the main difficulties and achievements of environmental policy in large Russian megacities. The use of imitation approach permitted an analysis of environmental policy in two cities as a series of simulacrums: urban elites simulate the involvement of the population in the urban agenda, citizens simulate interest in such activities. Despite the strengthening of the environmental component in the strategic development goals of the Russian cities, in practice, the policy pursued provides only an imitational improvement of the environmental situation. The main problem in both cities is the ambiguity of environmental legislation provisions, the disorganized interdepartmental interaction of authorized bodies in making and implementing managerial decisions, as well as the almost complete exclusion of professional ecologists and members of the public from this process. The opinions of Moscow experts on their inclusion in environmental decisions are divided: some believe that environmentalists are not involved in this process, and others that all decisions are peer-reviewed; while in Kazan, the first group of sceptics meets more support. According to the group of sceptics, their role in the environmental policy of cities, as well as the entire process of organizing civic participation, is of a symbolic performative nature, and is deliberately orchestrated by political elites. The authors make recommendations for improving the effectiveness of environmental policy in cities and involving various groups of the population in the decision-making process on social and environmental issues.

AB The author of the article explores the relevance of the theories of the European identity, memory politics, identity politics by placing them in the context of the European (international) security. The threats to European identity are not perceived as particularly important compared to the attempts to use identity as a legitimization tool for the foreign policy of the European Union. The article highlights following perspectives of this problem: the confrontation inside the EU on the politics of memory and identity and the justification of the EU foreign policy towards Russia by the need to protect the European identity and European values. The eagerness to defend own identity in Europe is only matched by the lack of patience and tolerance towards differing opinions, especially coming from historical rivals. The author uses the discourse-analysis and identity research methods. The main emphasis is placed on the competitiveness of identity politics and the possibilities of using it for political purposes, for example, to legitimize solutions to ensure the security of the European Union and the world as a whole.

AB Virtue Epistemology (VE) offers a specific approach to the problem of knowledge. The condition for the possibility of knowledge is the presence of certain intellectual abilities or traits in the subject - epistemic virtues. The task of VE is to compile a list of epistemic virtues, the development and cultivation of which should lead individuals to epistemic success with a high degree of probability. The vice epistemology arises as a branch of VE, which focuses not on virtues, but on vices that hinder achievement and deserve censure. Vices can be attributed to both individuals and communities. As a rule, those who tend to question the scientific consensus are considered to be vicious knowing communities: conspiracy theorists, denialists, religious fundamentalists, etc. The article argues that the logic of imputing blame for bad epistemic traits used in vice epistemology tends to turn from an epistemological tool into an ideological and political one. Since in the logic of the vice epistemology, "vicious minds" pose a threat not only to themselves, but also to the health of modern democratic societies, the eradication of vices is a primary political task. Using the theoretical framework of S. Fuller's social epistemology, the author shows how the rhetoric of vice epistemology is used today in the fight against anti-intellectualism and epistemic populism.

AB This article introduces into scholarly circulation documents kept in the funds of the Scientific Research Department of Manuscripts of the RSL and the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art relating to literary, socio-political, and material life of the Russkoye Bogatstvo magazine. Along with documentary evidence of literary activity, these documents serve to clarify human preferences, assessments, relationships, and reveal the internal mechanisms of the editorial life of the magazine.
   The chronological period which the archival materials date back to (1896-1900) is a landmark in the history of the magazine when it first became a legal print medium of the Narodniks and, second, recovered the cooperative principle of its publication. Finally, during the period in question, the relations between the members of the editorial board began to be regulated progressively. Also, to a greater extent than before, all financial flows that passed through the editorial board started to be regulated legally organising the work of the editorial board which allowed the magazine to continue to exist despite the many difficulties - censorious, political, repressive - it had to face on its long and difficult way to the reader.
   The materials presented in the article tell about some episodes of the fate of the famous magazine under the changing historical conditions and clarify facts of human, literary, and financial relations in the editorial board, while a brief real commentary restores the historical and literary context of the facts described in these documents. The subject of the published documents is specific circumstances including economic ones of the editorial office of Russkoye Bogatstvo, which until now have rarely been the subject of historical and literary publications and articles.

AB The article raises the topic of identity construction in public speeches of the leaders of regional subjects of the country. How and what identities do they build in discourse? What grounds are used by them for the population to identify with the region? Is the ongoing regional identity policy combined with an identity policy implemented at the national level? These issues are considered on the example of one of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation - the Republic of Tatarstan. Texts of the Messages of Tatarstan republic President R.N. Minnikhanov to State Council of the Republic of Tatarstan were explored using the theory of critical discourse analysis. This allowed using linguistic tools to reveal the symbolic space of public speeches of the regional leader. The purpose of their analysis was to identify tactics and techniques used by the regional leader in constructing the discursive reality of identity - all-Russian, regional, ethnic, religious, professional, gender. The head of Tatarstan speaks most of all about professional identity - about the accumulation of human capital in the territory entrusted to him, and about specific areas of the economy. The construction of all-Russian and regional identities illustrates the complexity of their construction and combination. The President of Tatarstan solves this problem with the idea of the consolidation of the Tatarstan community and the stability of the political system of the republic in the name of national security of Russia. He talks a lot about ethnic issues and the image of the region as a territory open to cooperation and creating favorable conditions for investment. All this becomes a brand of Tatarstan. Thus, the proposed approach takes into account various context-sensitive discursive and social practices of the discourse of the identity of a regional leader.

AB The article is devoted to key issues in the development of legal regulation of electronic forms of interaction between participants in corporate relations in Russia. The author consistently examines the development of legislation and the practice of its application since the mid-1990's until present day. The impact of the emergency legislation created to counter the spread of coronavirus infection in 2020 is separately considered. The author analyzes in detail the materials of the Bank of Russia, various political attitudes. For the first time in special literature, the correlation of the development of electronic forms of interaction in private and public relations is shown. The fundamental current legislative initiatives are considered. The purpose of the study is to formulate the main directions of the development of legal regulation, based on the analysis of the experience of the development of legislation, including regulating public relations. To implement this, the first part of the study (introduction) shows the traditional approach to corporate actions, evaluates its pro and contra; then the second part of the study describes and evaluates the first attempts of the electronic Interaction and digital prospects in the 2000's, including elements of electronic interaction in legal regulations; then (in the third part) a radical change in the legislator's approaches to regulation in 2010 is shown, estimates are given of the state of regulation for the period from late 2019 to early 2020 (before the start of the coronavirus pandemic); in the fourth part of the assessment of current draft laws, as well as the author's proposals in terms of directions of regulation are formulated and argued. The main conclusion was made about the need to expand the use of electronic forms of interaction for all legal entities, as well as the correlation of private law and public law regulation.

DT Article; Book Chapter
AB Russia's is an electoral political system biased towards authoritarianism. This chapter analyses the structural conditions of the political system and the major choices made by Russia's political and economic elites over the last two decades. The Russian elite sees modernization narrowly as only improvement in economic and technological competitiveness. However, they avoid long-term commitment to modernization programmes because a concrete failure could lead to a crisis in the legitimacy. In this way, the elite is both a promoter of, and an obstacle to narrow modernization. Our analysis shows that the Russian system combines the risks of both democratic institutional forms and those of authoritarianism. The most important constraints of Russian modernization stem from a combination of authoritarianism and informal administrative practices.

TI Images of Soviet Colonization in Archival Cinema: "Jews on the Earth" by

DT Article
DE Archival cinema; Soviet cinema industry; visual anthropology; Abram
   Room; Cinema Atlas of the USSR; Jewish settlement of the northern
   Circum-Pontic region
AB At the turn of the 1930s, the Soviet film industry actively released documentary films about life of remote regions of the country, giving its audience an opportunity to make virtual trips across the "sixth part of the Earth." This phenomenon had a political background: pooling leading creative and scientific forces for creation of the screen image of a multi-structured, multinational, and successfully developing socialist country within the frameworks of state project "Cinema Atlas of the USSR." The article is to introduce into scientific use an archival documentary "Jews on the Earth" (1927) directed by Abram Room, a film telling about the state program for Jewish settlement of the northern Circum-Pontic region. The socio-political, cultural, and ideological context of its creation is analyzed. The study draws on little-known visual and textual archives, as well as on data of the Soviet periodicals and excerpts from the screenwriter V. B. Shklovsky's theoretical heritage. Due to specifics of silent cinema, the film "Jews on the Earth" is a kind of cinematic text, consisting of approximately equal number of alternating film frames and text credits written by Vladimir Mayakovsky and Lily Brick. The film story is a sequence of episodes describing agrarization of the Jewish population, its "exodus" from the destroyed miasteczkos to the fertile southern lands. In the course of the research, it becomes obvious that this film is an example of the propaganda films describing the success of early Soviet colonization projects. The method used by Abram Room when working on the "Jews on the Earth" was a creative combination of the documentary and feature film techniques, allowing the film not just to convey dry information, but also to highlight socio-cultural context of the events. The film's significance was in its contribution to the visual chronicle of the Soviet colonization and to the development of the myth of existence of the Jewish community in the USSR. It is concluded that this film overcomes the frameworks of purely propagandistic narration and becomes an outstanding phenomenon of cinematographic art; it remains a significant example of the visual anthropology of the Soviet period, as well as a multilayered historical source that has not lost its relevance for modern scientific study.

TI BOLSHEVISM AND RELIGION IN ITALIAN TRAVELOGUES ABOUT SOVIET RUSSIA FROM

DT Article
DE Bolshevism and religion; travelogue; Curzio Malaparte; Vincenzo
   Cardarelli; Corrado Alvaro; USSR of the 1920s -1930s
AB This article analyses religious themes and motifs in travelogues by Italian authors who visited the USSR between the 1920s and 1930s. Their writings deal with religion from two different points of view: first, the authors use religious images and allusions to the Bible and other Christian texts as a common cultural code, which helps them comprehend various phenomena of Soviet reality; second, they explore different ways in which religion is present in Soviet society, which was (as the Italian authors saw it) simultaneously strictly atheistic and permeated with religious spirit. The analysis of these two aspects allows the author to point out some important features of the Italian reception of the Soviet Union and to study the influence of fascist propaganda and the European "Russian myth" on the image of the USSR in Italy. This can help us understand the mechanisms underlying the formation of the image of the "other" in intercultural contacts between Russia and the West. The research is based on studying the travelogues by the Italian writers Curzio Malaparte, Vincenzo Cardarelli, and Corrado Alvaro, who visited the Soviet Union between the 1920s and 1930s when political, economic, and cultural contacts between the USSR and other countries were expanding rapidly after the Civil War. Among other testimonies of the Italian "guests" in the Soviet Union, travelogues created by prose writers and poets are of particular interest as an example of how reality is transformed by literary imagination. These sources are mostly unknown in Russia and have not attracted the attention of researchers. However, they have been studied abroad from the 1980s in several articles and monographs dealing with the image of the USSR in Western culture; recent years have witnessed the publication of several works especially dedicated to Italian writers travelling to the Soviet Union. However, non-Russian researchers mostly regard these texts as historical sources without considering their literary structure: a "philological" approach is crucial for an adequate understanding of such a complex of both fictional and documentary sources. In the long run, the results of this research may contribute to the development of new efficient strategies for intercultural communication in the modern world.

AB The VI International Congress of Historical Sciences was opened in the Norwegian capital in August 1928. Soviet and emigrant scientists took part in the work of it. The forum in Oslo was the first experience of direct communication between the representatives of the national historical science school who found themselves on different sides of the state border. Researchers have touched this topic either as fixation of the fact of the participation of Russian historians in forums, or in biographical narratives as the context of the activity of a specific representative of the historical community, or as an illustration in the works devoted to studying the procedure for organizing overseas business trips to the USSR. Purpose of the present paper is to analyze the scientific communication of soviet and emigrant scholarly historians at the Congress in Oslo. As sources in this study, a congress program was used the programme of that forum incliding information on the organizing committee, the composition and number of delegations, reports at plenary and sectional meetings, "informal" events; articles in soviet and emigre publications dedicated to the forum; documentary of soviet scientific institutions; documents of personal origin of the participants of the event. The author of the article established the communication actors of this forum. They are soviet delegation that was represented both "Marxist" (M.N. Pokrovsky, M.N. Lukin, V.V. Adoratsky, S.M. Dubrovsky, etc.), and "bourgeois" historians (E.A. Kosminsky, V.I. Picheta). Emigrants were "dissolved" in US delegations (M.I. Rostovtsev), Poland (F.F. Zelinsky), Yugoslavia (A.K. Elachich), Germany (E.M. Kulisher), Czechoslovakia (P.N. Savitsky) and France (A.M. Kulisher, P.P. Gronsky). Furthermore the author detailed such communicative events as the "protest" of M.I. Rostovtsev in the Norwegian edition "Aftenpost", as well as its evaluation by soviet and emigrant scientists, a debate on the reports of soviet scientists, etc. The factors that influenced the communication process were installed. There are the methodological and political attitudes of actors, their emotional willingness to communicate; reformatting the communicative field as a world science, in connection with a change in foreign policy factors; events in the Academy of Sciences of the USSR; organization of the congress and established academic standards of communication. Despite the fact that in scientific terms the interaction of soviet and emigrant scientists was unproductive, the less the results of this study are important for further study of the institutional aspect of the Russian historiographic process in the 1920s-1930s.

AB On September 17-19, 2021, the election to the State Duma of the Russian Federation of the eighth convocation took place in Russia. The article analyzes the outcome of the vote according to official data of the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation. The results of the past elections are considered broken down by federal district, constituent entity, and municipality of the Russian Federation. We analyze the dynamics of the outcome of the parliamentary elections for the period from 2007 to 2021. The results of the latest election are compared with the results of the RF presidential election (2018) and the all-Russian referendum on amendments to the Constitution (2020). We consider the latest parliamentary election in a broad context - as part of the internal Russian political process. In this regard, a significant part of the article is devoted to the analysis of specific managerial decisions made by the Russian President and aimed at addressing the issue of forming a new, post-Soviet statehood, the key elements of which were revealed in the President's article "Russia at the turn of the Millennium" (1999). Official statistics, independent experts' assessments and sociological research findings allow us to say that the head of state has adopted comprehensive and consistent decisions to achieve the tasks he formulated in 1999 (the Russian idea, a strong state, an efficient economy); but so far, not all the goals stated in these tasks have been achieved. At a meeting with deputies of the State Duma of the eighth convocation the President noted that the low level of Russians' income was the main obstacle to stable development and demographic future. And it is the most objective self-assessment of the effectiveness of the entire system of public administration.

AB Classical science was mainly focused on the investigation of the cause-effect relations between phenomena obeying the principle of determinism: a certain phenomenon under certain conditions causes a certain effect. These relationships are expressible via functions. A function can be understood as an operation that, when applied to a certain object from the function domain, obtains a certain object from the function range. In nature, society, and cognition, there are relations of a different type. They obey the principle of quasi-determinism: one of several phenomena under one of several conditions causes one of several consequences. These relations are expressed by means of quasi-functions. In the article, a quasi-function is understood as an operation that is applied to an object from a subset of the (now) quasi-function definition domain to obtain an object from a subset of the quasi-function range. Since subsets of the domains of definitions and values of a quasi-function can consist of a single object, a special case of a quasi-function is a function. A special case of a quasi-function is also complete uncertainty (randomness) if the subsets from which the objects are selected coincide with the domain and range of the quasi-function. Since the function can be probabilistic, multi-valued, etc., then the quasifunction can be the same. The article reviews the main results of research on the application of the principle of quasi-functionality (quasi-determinism, limited determinism, nondeterminism) in the field of logic, mathematics, epistemology, natural science, technical and social knowledge. The methods of constructing quasi-functional logics of aletic ontological and logical modalities, and deontic logic are given. Ontological aletic modal logics are based on quasi-matrices, and logical ones are based on the semantics of restricted sets of state descriptions. Since methods of constructing logical systems that express relations in forms between judgments containing logical modalities are less known than systems with ontological modalities, they are given more space. Some problems for further research of quasifunctional logic and the methodological role of the principle of quasi-determinism in scientific knowledge are formulated, for example, the task of constructing logical systems, statements in which contain both logical and ontological modalities. It is proposed to apply the principle of quasifunctionality in the development of management decisions, etc.

AB Introduction. The article analyzes the influence of modern terrorism on two megatrends of contemporary world politics - globalization and democratization, which are linked with three levels of political organization of modern world - the Westphalian system, the system of interstate relations and the political system of states. Methods and materials. The methodology of systems approach is applied which allows identifying the variety of factors of mutual influence between terrorism and the selected trends. A simplified method of constructing a forecasting scenario is used, which provides a description of the influence of terrorism on the dynamics of the development of globalization and democratization in the future. The author relies on the ideas of a cyclical approach, according to which "upward" and "downward" stages are inherent characteristic of social and political processes. To understand the influence of terrorism as a factor of such cycles in the development of considered megatrends, scientific and analytical materials of Russian, Western and Iranian researchers are used. Analysis. It has been established that modern international terrorism uses the uneven distribution of benefits from globalization and its unifying characteristics in the sphere of culture and social relations in its destructive ideology and practice. As a result, globalization in the least developed countries is perceived in a negative way, and the risks of local rollbacks for this phenomenon remain. Long-term recommendations are proposed to improve the current situation. A scenario of anti-terrorist struggle, its state and prospects, and the dynamics of the two selected megatrends in the context of those scenarios have been developed. Results. It is concluded that terrorism is a significant negative factor for globalization and democratization. The first feels the influence of terrorism at the local level and it is unlikely to become a de-globalizing force, while the direct or indirect influence of international terrorism on the dynamic of democratization waves can be more significant.

DT Article
DE human development; social investment; e-participation; civil society;
   Russian regions
AB Human development, social policy and e-participation are interdependent. Effective social investment in the human capital leads to the emergence of demand for participation mechanisms among citizens, which in turn results in the willingness of authorities to implement participatory innovations. At the same time, e-participation is itself a part of the social investment paradigm, aimed at raising the quality of citizen feedback on social and economic policy. This paper attempts to test this interrelationship in the case of the Russian regions. Recently regional authorities have introduced a lot of e-participation platforms. However, many researchers emphasize the insufficient effectiveness of such platforms, as well as disproportions in their development at the regional level. Using an original evaluation methodology, we have estimated the quality of the regional e-participation portals. These data have been used in a quantitative study. The results of correlation and regression analysis suggest that human development and social expenses of the regions are important factors of e-participation development, in comparison to other potential predictors, like quality of political institutions, quality of governance and IT-expenses. It is impossible to say that human development inevitably leads to the growth of demand on e-participation among citizens, or the supply of such services from the government. However, the analysis shows that social policy is important for e-participation development: despite investment in ICT, regional authorities should actively contribute to social investment. Possible directions of such investment include providing equal opportunities via raising the living standards of the unprotected social groups, developing social programs for active citizens, eliminating regional disparities, as well as investing in the digital capabilities of citizens and civic initiatives.

AB Theme of the paper: the confrontation between the government and opposition forces with regard to the parliamentary elections of August 30, 2020. The paper analyzes the factors behind the opposition's first victory through the prism of the thirty year-long period. The author gives credit to the MontenegrinPrimorye Metropolia of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which made a decisive contribution to the defeat of the incumbent authorities, i.e. the politically disoriented President and the government who entered into conflict with the hierarchs through their arrogant and short-sighted monopoly rule. It was precisely the Church circles led by the late Metropolitan Amphilochius who managed to consolidate the ever-quarreling opposition, give them a new promising leader and offer an effective political platform that made the unification of the pro-uropean and Pro-Serbian parts of the opposition possible. The paper examines the international reaction to the transfer of power and its internal and foreign policy consequences. Chances of the new Cabinet of experts summoned by Zdravko Krivokapic to complete a full time are not too high. The trouble of the present coalition is not only its slim - by only one Assembly mandate - majority. The majority itself is extremely fragile, since the leaders of the Democratic Front, which forms the core of its pro-Serbian part, do not hide their feeling of being deceived and deprived of the division of trophies. Thereby they consider holding a snap parliamentary election almost a single task of the Cabinet. However, the government is already able to start dismantling the existing authoritarian regime of Milo Djukanovic. As far as its foreign policy is concerned it can be assumed that the new authorities would try to normalize relations with Serbia and Russia, deliberately damaged by Milo Djukanovic, but the fundamentals of the priority relations with the EU and NATO will remain unchanged.

AB This article analyzes approaches (philosophical, linguistic and historical) to the concept of "value" in the political discourse. When some critical events occur in the country or in the world, there is the transformation of axiological concepts. The article substantiates the point of view that the process of identification with a sociocultural community is clearly seen in modem political leaders.
   Based on philosophical and historical analysis, the authors disclose the transformation of the concept of "value".
   In each language, one can trace the component of categorization and assessment of political reality. Modem problems of transforming society and ensuring its sustainable development lead to the evaluation of the value system.
   The application of various scientific methods (including theoretical analysis of the provisions of philosophical, historical, pedagogical, sociological, cultural science) made it possible to perform this study.

DT Article
DE Russian polity; nineties; legitimacy; presidency; federalism; freedom of
   association; freedom of religion; open borders
AB In the 1990s, after the collapse of the USSR, was established the Russian polity, which continues to exist to this day. In this paper polity is understood as a macro-social community, united by a certain political order i.e., by a stable set of institutions and actors, as well as normative standards for organizing their interactions, both formal and informal. Establishment is understood as a series of events that establish these most fundamental frameworks for political action, as well as a repertoire of its scenarios, behavioral stereotypes, strategies, and tactics.
   The negative myth about the nineties, which has dominated the Russian public discourse in the recent years, describes the 1990s as a time of catastrophe and degradation. It certainly has its reasons, but this myth almost completely ignores the fact that the same decade was also a time of creation. Thus, the current state of Russia cannot be understood without paying attention to the circumstances of its establishment.
   The article describes some of the key features of the modern Russian polity that emerged in the 1990s - the "main takeaway" of the constituent era. They are the following: the electoral legitimacy of the supreme political power; non-partisan presidency; capitalism as the economic foundation of the political order; federalism as a principle of territorial organization of political space; freedom of association; freedom of religion; open borders. This list is not exhaustive: there are other elements of the design of the Russian polity that can claim the status of constitutive ones. However, a radical change in all these institutions together or in any one of them individually would mean another re-establishment of the political community as a whole.

AB This study examines the ethics of political consultants in Russia using the materials of 73 interviews with election campaigners (political consultants, chiefs of staff, field workers, lawyers, etc.). The study suggests that it is impossible to speak of Russian political consultants as a single community sharing common values. This professional group is heterogeneous and includes people with different perceptions of norms and ethical boundaries. Based on the analysis of the interviews, a classification of political consultants' professional taboos was developed: universal human morality, ideological orientation, professional orientation, procedural taboos, and legal boundaries. Interestingly, some of the informants used the rhetoric of justification when talking about ethical restrictions. The existence of certain standards of behavior was justified by the fact that the informant was somehow different from the "correct" political consultants (professional biography, belief system, etc.). The absence of ethical boundaries in several cases could be interpreted as a norm and a sign of professionalism, as opposed to as an anomaly.

AB Aim. The aim of the research is to study the symbolic capital of northern cities (semiotic potential) contained in "urban texts" and the influence of the historical memory of a multiethnic region on the political process of the region and the country as a whole, through a comprehensive and interdisciplinary study of the symbolic space of cities in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). Methods. The study used the cognitive approach, the method of space-time analysis, and the method of historicism and questionnaire survey. Symbolic space as a text is a heterogeneous content. Results. The results of the study show the importance of a symbolic resource as a brand tool, first, depending on the political context and introduction into the collective memory through a constant "reminder" of its importance and significance in the socio--cultural and everyday life of citizens. The resulting databases of monuments served as the basis for compiling a virtual album of monuments and art objects in the cities of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The research results can practically be applied in the field of education, politics, culture, in the study and promotion of the cultural and historical heritage of the regions of Russia. Conclusions. The urgent problem is the task of preserving the accumulated experience and values, places of memory, relics of the past, as well as ideas about the past that are stored in the memory of its inhabitants and the transfer of this knowledge to the younger generation.

LA English
DT Article
DE Crimea; Russia; Crimean Khanate; Ottoman Empire; public thought;

AB Research objective: This paper aims at the revealing and analysing various documents, created in different countries of Europe prior to 1783, which suggested the change of the Crimea's status and its accession to Russia, and the determination of interactions of these sources and general trends and principles behind discussions of the "Crimea question" in Russian and foreign public opinion.
   Research materials: This research addresses a large body of sources, created in Russia and the West from the sixteenth to eighteenth century, discussing the future of the Crimea - political treatises, memoranda, historical works, and correspondence.
   Research novelty and results: For the first time in the scholarship, the whole array of available sources on the planned accession of the Crimea to Russia has been analysed. It has been discovered that there were periods when the "Crimea question" was disputed in the West far more widely than in Russia. This "discussion" continued with the participation of very different authors, including the leading minds of the public discourse such as Voltaire or Francesco Algarotti. The attempts of the western intellectuals to influence the Russian government's decisions have been demonstrated. Therefore, the accession of the Crimea is a product of not only "Russian imperialism", as it is often suggested, but to a certain extent also of the Western Europe's public mindset. Obviously, such a development was considered quite admissible in the West, and many authors viewed it positively both for international relations and for the internal perspectives of the region. The given article has exposed the dynamics in these arguments, with initial counter-Muslim rhetoric underlining the existential opposition of Christianity and Islam and the need for "returning" lands which had formerly belonged to Europe. When the Enlightenment era started, the further reason of Europe's civilizing mission appeared. This mission was thought to be impeded in the Black Sea by the "backward" Islamic society. In Russia, the discussion of the future of the Crimea became topical in the second and third quarter of the eighteenth century, probably when the elite realized that the conquest of the peninsula had now become a reality.

TI FALSE THEORETICAL SYNTHESIS - THE BRAKE OF REAL PRACTICE (METHODOLOGICAL
   NOTES ON THE DISSOLUTION OF THE USSR)
SO SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Soviet sociology; theoretical synthesis; USSR; political economy of
   socialism
AB Theoretical synthesis in scientific disciplines is when new doctrines, the necessary revision of basic premises and the renewal of methodology are integrated in already existing theoretical knowledge. The need for theoretical synthesis is determined by changes in real practice, which require adequate scientific analysis. From this point of view, the paper analyses the political economy of socialism and Soviet sociology, which (along with scientific communism) were the major elements of Marxist social science in the USSR. Accordingly, the common methodological basis of both the political economy of socialism and Soviet sociology were the ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the model of socialist society which was based on them. It is shown that, despite repeated attempts undertaken by representatives of both disciplines, to critically analyse the concepts used in this methodology and to introduce new categories and conceptual additions, there was no significant update of the methodology. Therefore, necessary theoretical synthesis, in the course of which a phased "reset" and adaptation of theoretical knowledge to changing social reality takes place, did not occur either in the political economy of socialism or in Soviet sociology. The hypothesis that the "frozen methodology"of these sciences became the main obstacle to the adequate performance of their social functions, primarily prognostic and transformative, is justified. Thus, we associate the dissolution of the USSR with, among other things, the lag of the Soviet social sciences to reflect the needs of the socio-economic development of the nation. This lag is based on failures in the development and application of an adequate integral methodology for analysing the problems which built up in the USSR and to identify solutions.

TI Unknown Documents on the History of the February Revolution of 1917 and
   the Circumstances of the Abdication of Nicholas II
SO HERALD OF AN ARCHIVIST
LA English
DT Article
DE Historical source; State Archive of the Russian Federation (Gamma AP
   Phi); February Revolution 1917; Russian Emperor Nicholas II; political
   reforms; responsible ministry; M. V. Rodzianko; Duma opposition
AB The question of actions of the Russian Emperor Nicholas II during the February Revolution, and in particular, of his willingness or unwillingness to make concessions to the Duma opposition is a controversial issue in the historiography. Thus, Soviet and ?migr? historians believed that the tsar agreed to reforms under pressure of the military elite, which collaborated with the State Duma in those rebellious days. However, in modern historical science, an opposite opinion is gaining foothold, according to which in February - March 1917 the monarch showed a conciliatory attitude towards the opposition and was ready to agree to an actual limitation of his power by introducing a responsible ministry. The roadblock is assessment of sufficiency and reliability of the source corpus (mainly memoirs) for drawing the conclusion about the tsar's readiness for reforms. The lack of "documentary" evidence makes the narrative of the tsar's desire to establish a "ministry of confidence" vulnerable. However, documents of the period of the February Revolution that have been identified in the State Archive of Russian Federation (fond 97 "Office of the Palace Commandant of the Ministry of the Imperial Court") allow us to come nearer the end of this historiographical discussion. They are two typewritten paragraphs on a single sheet of paper, without a title or any additional information on its author, time, and place of creation. Source analysis has concluded that the documents are drafts of tsar's telegrams prepared by the palace commandant V. N. Voeikov on March 1, 1917 to be sent to the ex-chairman of the State Duma M. V. Rodzianko. The content of these drafts clearly indicates that the tsar was ready to provide a "ministry of confidence" even before his arrival at the headquarters of the Northern Front on the evening of March 1, that is, de facto to establish parliamentarism in Russia. The author's reconstruction of the events has showed that the first draft of the telegram is tsar's delayed response to the appeal of the Duma leader encouraging him to reform public administration (dated February 26-27, 1917). The second telegram is supposed to be sent to Rodzianko inviting him to Pskov for final decision concerning the head of the new "government of confidence." Despite the fact that they for some reasons had never been sent to the addressee, these "messages," nevertheless, are the "documentary" evidence of Nicholas II's consent to a gradual introduction of parliamentarism in the country during the February Revolution.

TI THE INVISIBLE HAND OF HISTORY: GOVERNMENTALITY, THE PROVIDENTIAL
   MACHINE, AND HISTORICAL MATERIALISM
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE governmentality; sovereignty; state of exception; historical
   materialism; providential machine; economy
AB The article is devoted to one aspect of the genealogy of Soviet governmentality. Michel Foucault, who elaborated the original theory of different types of governmentality, rejected the idea that socialism could arrive at its own practices of management. From his point of view, real socialism ties into the already existing police and liberal versions of governmentality. The "police-administrative" aspect of politics in socialist countries is well known, but its liberal component is only beginning to be systematically studied. In the theoretical canon, a revolutionary project nevertheless comes close to a liberal one: the Marxist criticism of bourgeois political economy shared the same epistemes with it. Some interpreters assume that this commonality also extends to concepts of history, that both Marxism and liberalism see economic rationality as a driving force in the historical process. Economic governmentality can be interpreted not only as a peculiar, historically determined disposition of power but also as a principle -both ontological and epistemological-that governs history itself.
   That interpretation was disputed by the most prominent Marxist philosophers. In particular, Walter Benjamin and Louis Althusser criticized social-democratic "economism" and "progressism" as they rehabilitated the key concepts of sovereign policy. "Intervention," "state of exception; "the exception becoming the rule"-all these concepts refer not to regulation by policing practices but precisely to the model of sovereign decision. Any such revival of sovereignty in liberation politics is certainly problematic, especially when both sovereignty and governmentality belong to the same "providential machine" of theological "oikonomia" as recent studies by Giorgio Agamben have made clear. The article points out the paradoxes in suspension of the "laws of history" by the sovereign using the example of the debate among Soviet historians (which was studied in depth by Andrey Yurganov) about the true nature of the Russian late medieval state. In conclusion, the author analyzes Antonio Negri's concept of constituent power as a force that can suspend the operation of the providential machine.

AB The world is in the midst of a systemic transition from unipolarity to multipolarity, which has prompted many experts to think deeply about the future of the international order. Leonid Savin, a leading figure of the International Eurasian Movement, is one such expert. His latest book, "Ordo Pluriversalis: The End Of Pax Americana And The Rise Of Multipolarity", covers a wide range of topics in arguing that the coming world order will be a post-liberal one characterized by civilizations acting similar to how nation-states presently do in the current order. Savin reveals how a rich diversity of social, political, religious, legal, and other systems have survived the brief period of American-led liberal unipolarity, which will lay the basis for the coming reorganization of international (or it should be said, inter-civilizational) relations. Intriguingly, since one of the foundations of this worldview is that these various systems will become more prominent in the wake of America's decline, he also attempts to incorporate many social theories into the field of political science to account for the increasingly complex nature of inter-entity relations. Savin's work is therefore practical but also highly theoretical, though this review simplifies the gist of his ideas by focusing only on the most important ones which contribute to his conclusion of nation-state-like civilization-level actors becoming a subject in global affairs.

AB Changes in the representation of the history of cities in Western Siberia in the journal "Siberian Lights" in the period from the beginning of the 20s to the mid 40s of the XX century are considered. These changes are interpreted by analyzing thegeneral contexts of the development of historical local lore in Siberia and the activities of various subjects of the memory policy at both local and state levels. The relevance of the study is due to the increased interest on the part of society and the state in the problems of forming the historical memory of Russians about the national and regional past as one of the foundations of social identities. The novelty of the research is seen in the fact that until now the Siberian magazine periodicals of the Soviet era, in particular, "Siberian Lights", are poorly understood as one of the significant means of forming the historical memory of society about the past of Western Siberia. The composition of the authors of materials on the history of Western Siberian cities is described in the article. The stages of the development of the history representation of West Siberian cities in the publications of the journal are determined, reflecting various, ideologically determined assessments of the historical past of the cities of Western Siberia. It is proved that during the Great Patriotic War, authors of works on the history of Western Siberian cities synthesized both the experience of Siberian ethnographers and their antagonists, pursuing the task of stimulating patriotic upsurge and the necessary social mobilization.

DT Article
DE Islamic parties; communication system; state; and nation-building;

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the transformation of the concept of Islamic party in the Muslim political discourse. Considering the processes of separation of Islam and politics as the formation of independent communication systems, the authors try to find an answer to the question of how, despite doctrinal restrictions, the notion "Islamic party" managed to acquire the features of a stable political concept. The authors propose a hypothesis, according to which, as the socio-political modernization of the Arab countries proceeds, the political system appropriates this concept, thereby specifying Islamic values at the level that allows to combine these values with new power institutions and fulfill specific political actions with these values.
   To test this hypothesis, the authors turn to the analysis of the temporal structure of the concept of party in Quran (Sunnah), the texts of the first ideologues of the Muslim Brotherhood and the rhetoric of the modern Islamic movements that occupy stable positions in the national parliaments. As a result of the study, the authors document the polysemantics inherent in the Islamic doctrine and identify the main parameters of the temporalization and pragmatization of the concept. According to their conclusion, the Islamic parties' abandonment of Quranic time and placement in the national-historical contexts, as well as the erosion of their initial core values, determine the modern perception and functional significance of such parties: they act as an institution that differentiates Islamic norms and ensures their combination with the institutions of the nation state that emerged in the process of modernization.

AB The article is devoted to the investigation of starting factors, potential moving realization forces and Japan project failure aimed at the foundation of the Jewish Autonomy in Manchukuo (Fugue Plan).
   In the course of current investigation the authors introduce documents of VChK/GPU, NKVD Administration in Chita Region about Russian national emigrant activities in Manchuria and FSB Administration of Russia in the Republic of Buryatia about Zionist movement prevention in the Soviet Power early years, the representatives of the above mentioned political forces being the most mass segment of Jewish opposition emigration to Manchuria.
   The foundation of Manchukuo state under the control of Japan with its mixed ethnical population structure claimed specific national politics, combining interests of the united state and different ethnical societies national identity preservation possibilities. The Jews were the target of Japan Foreign Department's fixed attention, this nation having its own national administrative structure - the Jewish Autonomous Region in the USSR. Due to their assistance the Japan intended to kill two birds with one stone: to obtain the opportunity of Soviet Union political blackmailing aiming at proposed desire to unite Manchurian Jews and that of Jewish Autonomous Region and establish the Jewish colony consisted of European immigrants being able to attract American investments.
   In the course of investigation the authors came to the following conclusions:
   economical achievements of Jewish community, being the most influential among all emigrant ethnical groups in Manchuria, allowed Japan to rely the perspectives to the future prosperity of the Chinese territories under Japanese occupation on the Jews;
   for the sake of Jewish community in Manchukuo growth Japan aimed at attracting immigrants whose life in the Fatherland faced the danger, first of all in fascist Germany; it was contemplated that the broad autonomy given to the Jews would make Manchukuo attractive for them from other countries;
   having clear idea about the Jewish lobby influence in the USA, Japan hoped for American fundamental financial investments into its own economics and occupied territories;
   beside economical purposes Fugue Plan pursued ideological ones. Once more it was supposed to demonstrate great historical Japanese mission to protect Eastern countries suffered from the white imperialism;
   Fugue Plan was Utopian and from the very beginning doomed to failure. Refugees having arrived to Japan and on territories under the control had no money even to keep their body and soul together. Hopes for American Jewish investments failed as well: rich American Jews granted their financial assistance only to their co-religionists and had no desire to contribute to Japanese well-being. Nevertheless, in the frames of this project Sugihara Tune, a clerk of the Japanese Consulate in Kaunas, succeeded in saving the lives of 6 000 European Jews.

AB The article analyzes aspects of the social policy of the crown government of Russia towards the peoples of the North Caucasus during the difficult period of their entry into the administrative-legal space of the empire. Their inconsistency and periodic change in social priorities are substantiated - the emphasis on the noble-princely elite was replaced by flirting with representatives of the "black people". The change in social vectors made it possible to limit the political ambitions of the nobility in their striving for an alliance with Turkey, the Crimean Khanate, and Iran. The complementary attitude of the Russian authorities to the decision of a part of the highlanders to accept Christianity and live under the protection of the Russian fortresses of Kizlyar, Mozdok, Astrakhan and others was proved. The Caucasian administration limited and then eliminated slave and dependent relations in the region. More than 60 thousand dependent mountaineers, thanks to the policy of Russia, became free in the 60s. 19th century, most of them received a free land allotment and some rights of citizens of Russia.

AB The article analyzes the main trends in the development of the political consciousness of Russian students in the aspect of public solidarity formation. Students as the most dynamic social and professional group and, at the same time, the human resource of public administration, corporate structures and systems for ensuring the reproduction of human capital (education, health care, social support, etc.) demonstrate the level of acceptance / rejection of certain behavior models to the greatest extent. Public solidarity in this study is considered as a system of spiritual ties of society, uniting citizens of the state and ensuring the state's integrity and social integration as a complex organism. This makes it possible to comprehensively study the conditions for the consolidation of national communities, to determine the conditions and factors of their development, the ability to overcome disintegration processes. The article discusses the topical problem of the formation of young citizens' political positions, views and behavior models. Traditionally, sociologists, political scientists, social psychologists, teachers, and anthropologists pay much attention to this problem: a variety of theories and approaches can be applied to explaining sociopolitical processes, and assessments of the prospects for political changes can be made. This research interest is not accidental, since, on the one hand, the range of issues related to the mechanisms of transferring social experience, the acquisition of new qualities and properties by young people is of great importance in connection with the need to understand the patterns and features of the political process. On the other hand, research in this area makes it possible, at least in general terms, to imagine what will happen tomorrow, especially, to see the contours of the social structures whose political positions and preferences can significantly predetermine the development of the entire Russian society. Will young Russians for the most part get into the precariat and, accordingly, become a "new dangerous class" deprived of significant volumes of social guarantees in comparison with their parents and ready to actively defend their interests through anti-systemic actions, relying on direct conflict with any government? Or will today's students, working youth and unemployed / carefree youth be able to find themselves in a complex society and realize their own ambitions, in professional, sociopolitical and personal terms? In addition, in this study, an attempt has been made to present the possibilities of state policy to influence the strengthening of public solidarity in the youth environment, or rather in the student community.

According to Johnstone, the purpose of argumentation is to maintain tension and risk as necessary conditions for a dispute where people go beyond the limits of their immediate experience and assert themselves as rational individuals, consciously exposing themselves to the risks of failing to defend their views. The relevance of Johnstone's ideas is connected with the contemporary development of argumentation logic with its key relation of the attack of one argument by another instead of the support of the thesis by arguments, interpreted in argumentation logic as a rejection of the attack.

AB In interdisciplinary contemporary science, knowledge is obtained from a close collaboration of specialists with various competences. Philosophy appears to be effective in clarifying the meaning of concepts, discerning the normative and the empirical, determining whether the differences in the positions of the participants depend on how they use words or the essence of the argument. Philosophers actively help to develop various fields of the humanities and social sciences and they are in demand in the sciences. They admit themselves that the history of philosophy is the unifying factor for all the areas, although the areas of their research are diverse. The article considers the question of whether it is possible to talk about a specific influence exerted by professional historians of philosophy on other disciplines. Restricted to the humanities, it traces the streams that exist in the dialogue between the humanities and historical-philosophical studies, and also considers what contribution the historians of philosophy make in the field of historical sciences, in various areas of political research, in gender studies, anthropology, theology and religious philosophy, as well as the articulation of practical philosophy as a way of life. Despite the fact that the history of philosophy is thought of as an auxiliary discipline, the contribution of the historians of philosophy to the development of related and indirectly related fields of scholarship is significant: they reconstruct the genealogy of meaning and as a result, the concepts or ideas are clarified within their native cultural environment.

AB The article deals with the Arabic-language epistolary documents of Dagestan origin, dating back to the late 19th-early 20th centuries. The relevance of this study is due to the need to enter into scientific circulation epistolary material from the Fund of Oriental Manuscripts of the Institute of History, Archeology and Ethnography of the Dagestan Federal Research Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It is noted that the introduction of these materials into scientific circulation will allow them to be used as sources of factual information, which can significantly supplement or clarify the facts already known to a specialist historian dealing with a particular problem. An overview of some Arabic-language epistolary documents of Dagestan origin is presented, their thematic characteristics are given, individual excerpts of letters from Arabic into Russian are translated, and the features of these documents are described in a historical context. Particular attention is paid to sources, as a storehouse of valuable information on the study of the socio-economic and political life of the Dagestan society. It is shown that the epistolary heritage allows one to reconstruct and interpret the history of everyday life, personal relationships in society and clarify certain aspects of the life of Dagestan society in the 19th-early 20th centuries.

AB The article presents the results of a sociological research with the aim to determine the extent to which public communications of Russian official bodies reflect the characteristics of modern crisis communications, as well as to identify factors affecting the effectiveness of public communications during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data analyzed are eighteen in-depth focused interviews that were conducted in February-March 2021 in seven out of eight federal districts of the Russian Federation. The interview guide included five sets of questions on the following topics: (1) preferred channels and genres of communication, and the motives of these preference; (2) the image of the crisis and the authorities during the crisis, and the factors that influenced these perceptions; (3) patterns of behavior during the pandemic and factors contributing to their formation; (4) evaluation of the effectiveness of official communications during the pandemic, and expectations related to the messages from authorities. The analysis revealed that Russian citizens demonstrate the behavior of a modern actor in such aspects as a tendency towards rational analysis of information, preference for discussive content, multi-channel information, and involvement in the global information space. With regard to public communications, it is argued that they do not provide space for discussions, do not take into account the analytical capabilities of the knowledge society actors, do not provoke the community involvement (in the exchange of information, social participation); their content is poorly focused on public interests and calls for personalization. Based on the informants' assessments, factors influencing the effectiveness of communications were identified. Among them are the use of channels preferred by the community, selection of competent speakers, laconic style of messages, promptness of information update, targeting, and others.

TI THE "SIBERIAN TSARDOM" AS A CONCEPT IN RUSSIAN CHRONICLES AND
   AMBASSADORIAL DOCUMENTS OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
SO ZOLOTOORDYNSKOE OBOZRENIE-GOLDEN HORDE REVIEW
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Shibanids; Tyumen khanate; Siberian khanate; Islam; Western Siberia;
   Moscow Tsardom; Ivan IV
AB Research objectives: To detect sources and stages for the formation of the concept of the "Siberian Tsardom" in the Russian chronicles and ambassadorial documents from the second half of the sixteenth century.
   Research materials: This work was carried out on the basis of the analysis of the published sources (chronicles, ambassadorial documents, charters and contracts, travelers' notes, cartographic data).
   Results and novelty of the research: In the native historiography, the Shibanid states in the territory of Western Siberia are traditionally referred to as the "Siberian khanate", terminology which dates back to the famous "Siberian Tsardom" in the Russian sources. An analysis of the written sources and cartography shows that during the fifteenth and first half of the sixteenth century, this notion was not used in any documents in relation to the Shibanids' possessions. Such terms were most often connected with Tura or East Turan or Tyumen by the Russian authors. As the political interests of the Muscovite rulers expanded east of the Urals, the name "Siberian land" appears in the corresponding sources, which was quite clearly differentiated from neighboring Tyumen for a long time. Only in 1563, during tripartite negotiations of the representatives of the Shibanids, Taibugids, and Ruirikovichi in Moscow, did Siberia start to be connected with the tsardom. This, as well, demonstrates the enlargement of the possessions of Tyumen khans to the east, something which was recognized in the Muscovite State. Afterwards, other names of the Shibanids' possessions were forgotten and in some cases the concept of the "Siberian Tsardom" or "Siberian Khan" came to refer to some earlier time and to be used for the Tyumen khans, Ibrahim and Kutluk. This reference to the past was created from historical examples which could be used to justify the notion of original Russian possession of the Siberian land.
   The concept of the "Siberian Tsardom" obviously reflected the interests of particular Muscovite political circles, because it allowed for the consideration of Kuchum Khan as a separatist who seized the throne which was previously in vassal dependence on Moscow, and likewise did not admit his dependence. This latter act legalized and justified the resulting military activities. This concept, elaborated by Moscow diplomats, justified the Siberian khanate being tied into a single category alongside the Kazan and Astrakhan khanates. Their accession could be considered not so much as an unjustified, illegal military aggression, but as an exercise of the right to establish an acceptable form of government for Moscow. The annexation of the Siberian khanate began to be seen as the return of original "fiefdoms" of the Russian sovereign, a right which he received from the old Russian dukes. However, we must understand that the idea of the longstanding tradition of this power was itself developed in Moscow no earlier than the 1570s.
   Thus, the choice of the name of the "Siberian Khanate (Tsardom)" to define the Shibanid states in the south of Western Siberia reflects the ideology of the Muscovite State from a historic point of view. It had little to do with how its rulers, the representatives of other post-Horde states, and the resident population would call it; for them, the concept of the "Tyumen Khanate" was much closer.

DE big challenge; COVID-19; pandemic; transformation of religiosity;
   religious institutions; religious practices; state-confessional
   relations; online religion; virtual religion; ROC; religious leaders
AB A big challenge which the COVID-19 pandemic put the spotlight on was religion and specifically the deep foundations of religious meanings and religious institutions present in public spaces: in particular, the bases of their legitimacy, regulatory uncertainty, and the emergence of new practices and structures that are religious, multi-vector, and even diametrically opposed to public expectations. In the reflexive search for an answer to the COVID-19 challenge, there is more polemic than interpretive instrumentalization. In political pragmatics, there is more of an intrusion of politics into the previously closed religious sphere itself than the formulation of the principles of the new status quo of the secular and religious. The pandemic actualized the ratio of modern to traditional, translating this problem into the scope of the limits of applicability of online opportunities, blurring and changing the very essence of traditional religious practices and foundations. Numerous newly emerging numerous phenomena within the Church and in the space of its supporters have led to the traditional sociology of religion being questioned, insistently offering to pay attention to acquiring the relevance of approaches from other fields of religious knowledge; these are already seen in the logic of possible transformations, possibilities of splitting in the future, and the need for new tools, such as heterogeneity. Religious institutions in the context of the modern global challenge demonstrate the blurring of direct subjectivity, while uncertainty implies a drift to various tactics of specific representatives, raising questions of ontology and stability. The diversity and ambiguity of the behavior strategies used by religious institutions, religious leaders, and religious practices in Russia actualize a pool of different trends that lead to different opportunities for redistributing the balance between religion, society, and politics, between Faith and institutions, and between axiology and modern pragmatics. The methodological message of the article is based on the recognition of the multidimensional multiplicity of forms of religious presence that are not reducible to a single explanatory scheme. It actualizes and complements many concepts of social development that have become ineffective and have a linear character. To verify speculative positions, the authors turned to the heuristic potential of discourse analysis, as well as to the formation of a reference base for the event series.

AB Using materials from Russian archives as well as from the Leeds Russian Archive (Great Britain), this article traces stages of activity of the Russian Political Delegation (RPD). The Delegation was established in 1919 by the Russian Political Meeting (RPM) in Paris for direct participation in the Versailles Peace Conference. Its activities were authorized by Admiral Kolchak, Supreme Ruler of Russia. The article covers the formation of the RPD, which included Prince Lvov, N. V. Tchaikovsky, V. A. Maklakov, and S.D. Sazonov. Due to circumstances beyond its control, the Delegation did not get the opportunity to participate in the conference, and its international activities were quite limited. However, after the dissolution of the Russian Political Meeting, the Russian Political Delegation continued its activities, claiming the status of the foreign center of a White Movement. Its ranks aggravated the split between public figures and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Movement: social activists wanted the government of Omsk to remove S. D. Sazonov. Admiral Kolchak decided to retain control of his government over foreign missions, keep S.D. Sazonov as Minister, and asked the delegation to continue its work. In fact, in late 1919 and early 1920, the Russian Political Delegation managed to head the foreign mission of the White Movement. However, it was unable to cope with problems standing on its agenda. G. E. Lvov and N.V.Tchaikovsky, who used the situation of the Delegation members to influence affairs, diligently supported its existence. The last statements of the Russian Political Delegation refer to the end of 1920, the period of evacuation of the Wrangel's army from Crimea. Analysis of the RPD's activities provides an insight into challenges that in general were characteristic of the Movement and that eventually played their role in its defeat.

AB This study aims to provide rationality regarding Donald Trump as a fake news aggregator. Donald Trump's leadership from 2017-2020 is controversial and created a massive wave of fake news. As a populist leader, he often issued statements that confused the public during his reign, causing people's trust in the Trump administration to decline. He made the statement not only on national television but also on social media. Social media is the right political communication funnel for any populist leader when it comes to audience reach. Donald Trump is an active user especially on Twitter and uses it to spread misinformation and disinformation to spread what he calls as a truth. Many statements make Donald Trump worthy of being called a fake news aggregator. This study uses a qualitative approach with the content analysis method. Thirty-two samples of Donald Trump's hoax statements that were examined found that the hoaxes spread by him were not limited to just one topic. This research has both theoretical and practical significance. From a theoretical point of view, this research contributes to the development of literature regarding the relationship between hoaxes and populist leaders. In practical terms, this literature contributes to understanding the characteristics of populists and how social media is used as a funnel to spread hoaxes.

DT Article
DE Arab Nationalism; Baath; Levant; secularism; Atab Awakening; qawmism;
   watanism; national liberation; Islam; hybridity; convergence
AB Arab Nationalism (AN) is a broad ideological and political movement that played a key role in the liberation of the Arabs initially from Ottoman rule, then from European domination, and ultimately in the emergence and development of a whole array of independent Arab states. The article offers a radical new take on the current state of this movement, whose adherents have been in power in Syria for almost six decades. A review of the movement's genesis undertaken by the author reveals that the Levant-Iraq zone has been a major feeding ground for the advent and elaboration of the united Arab nation concept, which formed the backbone of the ideology and politics of one of the three AN Pan-Arab segments - Baathism. It is ascertained that for its survival, as a ruling party movement in Syria, a matter of paramount importance is the historic memory, that has played a much more prominent part in politics in Oriental countries than in the West. From an overview of the AN historical heritage, two tides of the Arab Awakening are singled out, and the role played by the personalities who devised the fundamental secular tenants of the Pan-Arab ideological and theoretical background is highlighted. In this context, the author identifies a continual trend underlying strained relationships between AN and the Levant, on the one hand, and the Ottomans, thereafter the Turkish nationalists of nowadays, on the other hand, meanwhile the modern slogan of the latter ("Five States - One Nation") is practically a replica of the chief AN slogan ("One Arab Nation"). The article analyzes the evolution of the dichotomy: Qawmism (Pan-Arab Nationalism) - Watanism (particular, country-wise patriotism). Despite the fact that the Pan-Arab ideas have apparently suffered a crushing defeat, under conditions of glorification of the nation-state model, there are substantial prerequisites in the Arab world for its integration, that provide an impetus for AN to get back on track in the foreseeable future. However, this would require an ideological transformation of AN and for it to adopt its hybrid, or rather convergent variety, in order for it to meet the challenge of overcoming the antagonism between Qawmism and Watanism.

DE Dusya Vinogradova; Stakhanovism; fan letters; socialist competition;
   celebrity culture
AB The main question of the article is why Soviet citizens of different professions and ages wrote letters to Stakhanovka, who was the first Soviet celebrity. To answer it, the author relies on "celebrity studies", a new direction in the social sciences and humanities, in which historians turn to the study of "celebrity culture". In the article, a celebrity is seen not as a status assigned to an individual and providing prestige and other social dividends, but as an analytical tool for analyzing the culture of society. Therefore, to study the mechanisms of the emergence and spread of celebrities, it is important to shift the research focus from studying the personality of a public figure to fame in general. In other words, it is important to pay attention to the cultural practices of consuming the image of a public figure, as well as to the political and social mechanisms by which these practices were constructed. Referring to "celebrity culture" as a tool for analysis, the author demonstrates that in the 1930s, the Soviet Union was not an anomaly in comparison to the Western societies. The Soviet culture of celebrity was the basis of the planned economy and the authoritarian regime, but this did not exclude the presence of non-repressive, democratic phenomena among the audience of the central Soviet press.

AB At present, there is no common perception in modern science and international political practice of what the world (international) order (legal order) is. The article analyzes the relevant points of view. It is concluded that by referring to the relevant provisions, generally accepted in the framework of the general theory of law and the theory of international law, it is possible to get close enough to the solution of this problem. The article also examines other problems related to the essence of the concepts of the world (international) order and its types (world public order, world legal order and global world legal order), and also the varieties of social norms of the international regulatory system, the results of the implementation of which shape the corresponding orders. Special attention is paid to the fact that, in contrast to the widespread perceptions, all three types of world order are neither a set of international relations, nor a set of norms regulating such relations. According to the theory of international law, they are the result of the implementation of the requirements of certain norms of the international regulatory system aimed at managing international public relations. In addition, various factors influence the state of a particular type of international order (including a change in the hierarchy of states depending on their role in the international political and/or economic system, the formation of new centers of power, a change in bipolarity, polycentricity or monocentricity of the world, the emergence of multilateral integration formations. the activities of international multilateral institutions, etc.), but they should also not be confused with international orders themselves.

ID HIERARCHICAL APPROACH; PARADOX
AB The article contains a critical analysis of Wittgenstein's theory of logical symbolism. According to an influential interpretation, Wittgenstein presented in the Tractatus a new method of solving paradoxes. This method seems a simple and effective alternative to Russell's type theory. Wittgenstein's theory of logical symbolism is based on the requirement of clear notation and the context principle: the type of a symbol only "shows" itself in the way we use the signs of our language. The function sign phi(phi x) does not express any paradox, because the syntactic rules for its use, written in clear notation, should "show" us that phi(phi x) = psi(phi x). Many researchers (Davant, Ishiguro, Mounce, Ruffino, Friedlander, Jolley, Livingston, Ladov, et al.) follow this interpretation. However, the difficulty of such a view on Wittgenstein's theory of logical symbolism is that there hides the fallacy of petitio principii. Indeed, in examples of a functional sign of the form phi(phi x), we are interested not only in the question of whether the functions f are different symbols, but also in how this functional sign phi(phi x) itself excludes the symbolization of the same object by different ways. This interpretation is contrasted with the idea that Wittgenstein's theory of logical symbolism is in fact a modified analogue of Russell's simple theory of types. The reciprocality principle becomes the core of Wittgenstein's theory: the combinatorial potential of the "prototype" of a functional sign is identical to the combinatorial potential of the "prototype" of an argument. According to Wittgenstein, only describing the combinatorial potential of linguistic expressions (symbols) can vanish the illusion of paradoxes. The function cannot be its argument, because the function sign phi(phi x) already contains the "prototype" of its argument, "showing" us that phi(phi x) = phi x. The correctness of this interpretation does not exclude the possibility that the differences between Russell and Wittgenstein are in fact nothing more than facon de parler.

DT Article
DE Soviet project; internationalism; agrarian question; Marxism;
   Bolshevism; peasantry; politics; philosophy; history; economics
AB The formation of the USSR five years after the October Revolution followed not only from internal needs, but also from the idea of "dialectical transition" of the feudal-capitalist component of the Russian empire's heritage to the socialist form. The USSR formation also had a more ambitious goal: The Soviet Union was expected to become the first experience of creating the "world workers and peasants union" (V.I. Lenin). First of all, this experience was gained in the agricultural sphere - the dominant sector of the country's economy. In this regard, the main scientific problem of this article is the philosophical and historical understanding of the methods invented by the Bolsheviks during the war communism policy period in 1918-1921 to form a new sense of agrarian life adequate to the future "world USSR". After a short break of NEP the experience gained in the agrarian sphere was used during the forcible collectivization in the Russian Federation and in the territories of the former Russian Empire annexed to it for internationalist purposes. The article analyzes in detail the political and ideological reasons of the Bolshevik's activities solving the agrarian question during the periods of "war communism" and collectivization, the legal basis they had developed for this issue, the successive elimination of the peasant cooperation as a self-organization of active people, the idea of historical necessity and the communist practicability of the overall labor obligation and the effectiveness of forced labor, as well as the consequences of these measures: the terrible famine of 1920-1921 and the armed resistance of the peasantry to the agrarian policy of the Bolsheviks.

   research; Poland; parliamentary elections; electoral behaviour
AB This article refers to the topic of parliamentary elections in Poland. The authors maintain the hypothesis that more and less stable regional clusters of electoral behavior, which undergo some changes over time, exist in Poland. The study traces a pattern between the formation of regional clusters and a number of factors, such as their proximity to the borders of other states, ideological orientation of the party programs, the traditions of political culture that have developed in the regions and the division of regions into urban and rural. The study uses Moran's index to describe the neighborhood effect. Local clusters of spatial association were calculated by means of local Moran's index. Maps of cluster locations were constructed on the basis of the results of the 2007-2019 parliamentary elections. This allowed us to consider their spatial changes in perspective. The novelty of the work consists in use of the mathematical method of spatial autocorrelation in electoral study and consideration of the results both from the point of view of the percentage ratio and neighborhood index. It was concluded that some regional clusters remain stable throughout four electoral cycles, however, they undergo minor changes. Most of these clusters are located in rural areas. As a rule, cities are not included in stable clusters, they form separate centers, distinguished by the variety of the electoral preferences of citizens. The four analyzed electoral cycles show a tendency of reduction of the spatial dependence between the results of voting in constituencies and stability of regional clusters in Poland.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of interrelation between economic growth and change of government in the regions of Russia. The authors hypothesize that there is some correlation between them. In order to test the hypothesis, the quantitative analysis based on the data of 82 subjects of the Russian Federation was used. It was discovered that there is some interconnection between change of power and previous economic dynamics. This tendency has the higher significance during the period of indirect election of governance (2005-2012) At the same time, such economic indicator as GRP per capita is less interconnected with change of power. In other words, a regional recession or stagnation is much more likely to lead to a change in leadership than the low (compared to the national average) level of GRP itself. In addition, after the change of leadership in the short term, the dynamics of regional development is somewhat improving. In addition, after the change of leadership in the short term, the dynamics of regional development is somewhat improving. Apparently, these findings could be applied to the national level, but in this case, there should be additional discussions also about change of governance of executive power and legislative authority. It should also be borne in mind that effective regional leaders are often transferred to the federal level or to other, less successful regions within 2-3 electoral terms.

AB The article analyzes the features of the establishment of Russian philosophy as an academic discipline at Leningrad-Petersburg University. In this regard, the work deals with the methodological principles and guidelines for courses in the history of Russian philosophy by professors P. F. Nikandrov and A. A. Galaktionov, ideological and philosophical foundations of their study guides, and the novelty of their approach to studying Russian philosophy. It is emphasized that this stage of the study of Russian philosophy at the Leningrad University can be characterized as critical; it made it possible to study in detail the concepts of many previously unknown thinkers to the general reader. The article examines the specificity of teaching Russian philosophy at the Department of the History of Russian Philosophy chaired by professor Alexandr F. Zamaleev. The conceptual frameworks that formed the basis of the new educational research paradigm are revealed. They were based on a comprehensive analysis of Russian philosophy in the context of the development of Russian spiritual culture, which made it possible to identify certain theoretical features in Russian philosophy: anthropologism, moralism, historicism, epistemological realism, etc. Significant attention in the article is given to the analysis of the methodology for the course "Political Thought in Russia" at St. Petersburg University, its structure and basic methodological guidelines are determined. It is argued that teaching Russian political thought was based on taking into account the traditions of statehood and political consciousness that developed in Russian society. The conclusion is made that in the process of the formation of Russian philosophy as a scientific and academic discipline at Leningrad-Petersburg University, objective difficulties arose in rethinking the methodology of historical and philosophical science as well as developing a new paradigm of socio-humanitarian and philosophical knowledge.

AB The article is focused on the structure and ideology of the European Free Alliance. The research aims at identifying resources and possibilities of the institutionalized transregional and supraregional cooperation of ethnoregionalist parties at the European level. The research was conducted predominantly in the paradigm of structural functionalism, while employing the methods of institutional analysis, QDA (exemplified by program documents and key actors' rhetoric), network analysis (based on the data of the EU data-bases). The research resulted in the following conclusions. The EFA has not succeeded in becoming an entirely representative europarty for the respective party family, due to deep discrepancies between ethnoregionalist parties in the domain of ideology, goals, attitude towards European integration, and domestic political opportunities. The attempts to create an integrative ideological platform based on "creative eurofederalism" and "progressive nationalism" may hardly be called successful. Besides, big ethnoregionalist parties prefer to cooperate with bigger and more influential europarties and political groups of the European Parliament. However, in the EP-2019, "Greens-EFA" political group improved its position, even in spite of Brexit. This happened not because of the EFA achievements, but because of the growth in representation of the European Green Party. Though influence and capacities of the European Free Alliance are lower than those of other europarties, it has a significant symbolic meaning as a structure unifying different ethnoregionalist actors.

AB The paper is a reflection on the book The New Science of Politics: An Introduction by the German-American political philosopher Eric Voegelin. The book is considered as a classic work in the field of the political theory of the 20th century. The first edition of the book was published in 1952, but its Russian translation was only completed in 2021. The author notes that although Voegelin's thought is clear, the reading of the work may be difficult because Voegelin re-invents the terms that were already established in the scientific field, such as positivism, Gnosticism, the philosophy of history, the philosophy of consciousness, etc. To clarify the thinker's contribution to political philosophy, the author addresses several studies that describe this contribution. After a brief enumeration of the components of this 'contribution', the author discusses how fully these points are reflected in The New Science of Politics. It turns out that although this work is based on six lectures, it contains all the topics of Voegelin's political theory. The author further clarifies several key terms of the philosopher, and proceeds to the presentation of Voegelin's concept. This technique makes Voegelin's political theory crystal clear. Finally, the author turns to the context of "before-Rawls" political theory and briefly describes how the jurist and (later) political scientist Hans Kelsen reacted to Voegelin's work. The author also analyses the polemics between Hannah Arendt and Voegelin, explaining why Arendt's reaction to Voegelin's criticism might seem strange, although it should not be considered as such. He concludes by referring to some excellent assessments of Voegelin's philosophy, and states that the great hope that Voegelin would become the most important philosopher of the twentieth century did not come true.

AB An attempt is made to analyze the place of political cartoons in the current socio-political media discourse in the United States. The material was the cartoons published in the spring of 2020 from USA Today and Philadelphia Inquirer, the informational occasion for the creation of which was the Covid-19 pandemic. The definitions of political cartoons as a multimodal text with a complex coding system is considered in the article. It is noted that in this type of text, phenomenological cognitive structures are actualized both through linguistic projection and through visual-spatial images. Attention is paid to intertextuality as the basis of political cartoon: the authors proceed from the position that the decoding of meaning by the recipient depends on whether he and the author have common background knowledge. It is shown that the Covid-19 pandemic is thematically embedded in the broader socio-political agenda, whereby a successful interpretation requires the recipient to have background knowledge of the current sociopolitical challenges facing the United States, namely the domestic political agenda. It is stated that the studied cartoons are distinguished by their reliance on precedent, and the actualization of background knowledge occurs through a combination of the visual and verbal components of the text. It is concluded that among the linguistic means of creating a satirical effect, a play on words is distinguished based on the literal and figurative meaning of individual lexical units.

AB The images of geographical space and historical time, born in the practices of poetic experience and philosophical reflection, subsequently migrated to the subject-matter domains of sociology, political science, economics, and other social sciences, undergoing a long conceptual as well as analytical evolution. In fact, they turned into effective tools for scientific analysis of social, political and economic proceses with the scope of application ranging from theoretical constructs and expert assessments to managerial decision-making and futurological forecasts. Moreover, cultural and historical images, arriving into the sphere of theoretical as well as expert-and-analytical knowledge from pre-scientific practices, came back to the sphere of everyday life and began to play an increasingly important role in self-identification, as well as in individual and collective searches for identity. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the newly formed concepts of the East and the West, the Modem and the Archaic, in their dynamic dimension, gave birth to the "procedural" derivatives thereof, the most well-known and the most broadly applied among which is the concept of modernization, which manifested itself, inter alia, in the emergence of a theory or even many theories of the same name. At the same time, the concepts of westernization and archaization have been less fortunate: in fact, they have turned into the terms used in the conceptual space of the same theory of modernization. The rarest to be used is the fourth of the concepts in question - the concept of orientalization. This article deals with the very few instances of the use of this term found by the author in modem scientific literature.

DT Article
DE political sociology; social mythologems of space; Eurasianism; Western
   geopolitics; Atlanticism; hermeneutics of geopolitics; space of
   development
AB The article considers the origins of Eurasianism as a Russian social doctrine that emerged as an answer to the Western geopolitical concepts, in particular of the Anglo-Saxon and German geopolitical schools. Both concepts serve to justify social institutions and associations based on the difference between the spaces of the Eastern and Western parts of Eurasia. The authors argue that geopolitics of both the Western-European and Eastern-European types is based on mythologemes which claim to be of scientific importance but are not capable of achieving this status. The article shows that both theories claim (1) the invention of an ideal timeless homeland of society on the basis of a mythological interpretation of space; (2) possession of sacred knowledge (through the sacralization of space) which is actually profane. The key difference between Western geopolitical schools (Anglo-Saxon and German) and Eurasianism is the proposed connection between space and a specific society. Geopolitics proceeds from the constant spatial opposition as a factor of social-political competition. The geopolitical assessment of reality is based on the need to attack the 'alien' space due to its initial, 'natural' hostility. The geopolitical hostility and even aggressiveness contradicts the defensive nature of Eurasianism which declares that space unites peoples with similar values; therefore, their societies should defend their 'space of development' from the encroachments of the Western countries. Thus, Atlanticism as a global project of the contemporary Western geopolitics fundamentally contradicts Eurasianism which does not accept hegemonism and supports the principle of a multipolar world; today, the level of conflict between these projects is not high, although there are no prospects for this conflict resolution.

   science; Lysenkoism; agriculture; bureaucratization; the USSR
AB The struggle in Soviet biological and agricultural science is examined through the prism of letters of scientists to Soviet leaders in the 1950s. Scientists' "letters to power" were an important form of struggle of the scientific community to normalize the situation in the agrarian and scientific sphere under conditions of total party-state control. Considering science to be the most important element of the USSR's international prestige, scientists who advocated classical genetics considered it necessary to rid biological and agricultural science of external "imperious" influences on the sphere of scientific knowledge. Moreover, some suggested the active use of party-state structures, not excluding law enforcement agencies, against their scientific opponents. Others believed that the shortcomings of the organization of Soviet science could only be eradicated by the scientists themselves, provided that the scientific community was widely involved in identifying the most important scientific areas through free creative discussions. With all the disagreements, the appeals of scientists to Soviet leaders, the author concludes, contributed to a change in public sentiment in favor of genetics. On the contrary, the supporters of Trofim Lysenko by their "letters to power" pursued the goal of maintaining his dominant position in science. Transferring scientific problems to the political plane, they called on Soviet leaders to resolve the contradictions accumulated in the agrarian-scientific sphere by the methods of party-state influence. The rejection of each other's arguments by the scientific opponents did not allow them to reduce the severity of confrontation in biological and agricultural science and did not contribute to scientific research. The appeal of geneticists to the authority of world science in the context of the Cold War further aggravated the situation in the scientific community, since in the opposite camp, this phenomenon was assessed as ideological sabotage. The inertia of such traditions of scientific communication persisted for a long time.

TI THE STATISTICAL SOURCES ON THE HISTORY OF THE SIBERIAN CITIES AT THE

   First General Census of 1897; urban science
AB The series of socio-economic, political and administrative transformations, the development of production and lines of communications in the second half of the XIX - beginning of the XX centuries made certain changes in the development of cities, the composition and number of population, the development of socio-economic infrastructure. Siberia had its own development features. In this regard, the consideration of this territory is of scientific interest. Often urban studies (gorodovedenie) are based on statistical materials, which were made in a large number in the XIX - beginning of the XX centuries by different departments. Thereupon it is important to take into account the specificity of the sources, the degree of their reliability, completeness.
   The purpose of the article is the historiographic analysis and identification of the most high-demand sources of statistical data on the Siberian cities at the turn of the XIX- XX centuries on the basis of historiographic analysis of the modern researchers' work.
   Since the study is the historiographic review, the works of modern historians are used as the sources, in which the issues of the urban history of Siberia reflect.
   The researchers working with official statistical sources note that their analysis seems to be a very difficult research task. It is necessary to take into account the time and circumstances of collecting data, their processing, because of most statistical books are revised primary data, therefore, they can carry some inaccuracies after the processing stage. The statistical data are necessary for the compilation of time series, with the subsequent possibility of comparing data in a chronological perspective. However, the difficulties of analyzing data often lie in the heterogeneity and insufficiency of the available information. As a rule, the researchers use a wide range of sources to compare information with the aim to achieve objective results. Thus they enforce data from one source with information from other sources.
   Statistical materials complexes allow studying of urban history widely and comprehensively. The analysis of the historiography of the Siberian urban history revealed that the researchers, striving for the objectivity of the submitted data, compare the information of sources, which are most often published by different departments, and also identify possible statistical errors associated with objective reasons (lack or failure to provide information from a particular department) and subjective ones (distortion of information in analysis, incomplete its representation).
   Despite the great study of statistics on the Siberian urban history, lots of publications are practically not used in research or used partially. The above is also true of the materials of the General Census. In summary, statistical publications and census data own significant information potential and need to be introduced into a wider scientific circulation with their mandatory critical analysis.

AB The functioning of various types of documents in the information space is determined by new technologies: social networks, blogs, forums, Internet exhibitions, electronic periodicals and non-periodical editions; they directly affect the formation of ethical, political, socio-cultural perceptions of modern users. There is a tendency to diversify these technologies as applicable to various types of electronic documents and for purposes of their use. Nowadays, the archives face a number of important tasks concerning study, analysis, admission for storage, and further use of documents. Among the issues requiring consideration and clarification in relation to electronic documents there is definition of the original, distinction between the original and electronic copy, the original and falsified document, definition of its material carrier, broadcasting of information, as well as some legal issues, primarily, questions of ownership, copyright, etc. The accumulation of information in the virtual sphere proceeds in various forms: there are photographs, videos from digital cameras, all kinds of electronic documents; it necessitates a clarification of some provisions concerning acquisition, storage, and usage of the documents and the information they contain. The article uses a research metaphor of "digital cultural layer" to express the changes in the archival sphere, where there emerges a new layer (complex) of electronic documents that has been created and is functioning in the virtual sphere. Electronic digital document doesn't fit the usual paradigm, according to which a document always has a visualized material medium. The notion of the "original" becomes a subject for clarification. Acceptance of electronic documents for storage leads to adjustment of such traditional notions as "storage item" and "record-keeping item." Identification of electronic document also requires clarification, since it does not lend itself to "identification" in the usual sense and we can only speak of conditional identification. The issues of acquisition, storage, and usage of electronic documents are considered in the article on the example of personal collections. As a significant part of citizens participate in various forms of social activity on the Internet (blogs, forums, electronic correspondence, etc.), thus expanding the social base of creators and holders of personal information, the near future will see a replenishment of personal provenance collections by electronic documents of personal origin.

AB Middle East Arab diasporas, primarily the Iraqi and Syrian ones, are playing an in-creasing role in the economy and demography of Sweden. This study aims to describe the formation of economically active diasporas in Sweden over the past three decades. There has been a paradigm shift in the immigration and business activity of people from the Middle East Arab countries in Sweden. Diaspora leadership changes depending on the situation in the countries of origin and migration phenomena driven by political and military shocks. This change affects the migration process and the role of communities in the economic life of the country. The study draws on the work of top research centres and data from leading Swedish and international statistical agencies. The rise and subsequent decline in Syrian immigration, which included labour migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, did not restore the unconditional leadership of the Iraqis among the Arab com-munities of Sweden. The significant business activity of Syrian immigrants, their profes- sional skills, level of education, and broad business ties make the diaspora a likely leader in the Arab community. These four factors also contribute to easier migrant integration into Swedish society.

AB The article reviews emerging research programs and analyzes new research strategies, including media epistemological and media archeological approaches, interface semiotics, economic theory of communication between market entities, etc. The main questions of the article: how is a digital turn in culture possible, what are its preconditions and consequences that radically transform the context of life? The development of information technologies has led to the emergence of a number of research areas such as chaos theory, transformational linguistics, bioinformatics, etc. Applied theories today can already change not only basic epistemological, but also ontological concepts. Thus, the spheres of everyday existence, habitually labeled as marginal, become decisive for global political, economic and socio-cultural subjects. So, the message on social networks affects the stock markets, the behavior of computer players - on the ways of interacting with digital gadgets, and the instrumental and communication skills of our time, the network content of private video bloggers can sometimes determine the main agenda in the media. Software applications of the digital environment developed in the IT industry determine the set of tools available to the user, and with them, the ways of expressing and perceiving thoughts. The authors share the conclusion: whatever we work on, we work together with the digital mind, which in the form of Big Data, Big Five, Cyber DNA and other technologies determines our actions. The essence of the digital turn is not taken by the arsenal of pre-digital methodological attitudes that require a return to the original unity of logic, epistemology, ethics and aesthetics in an era of epistemological uncertainty. The situation becomes more complicated in connection with the declared counter-tendencies of globalization - glocalization.

   policy; US presidential elections
AB The emergence of Donald Trump in American political life was an unpleasant surprise for the mainstream elite, even though it could have been predicted. Unresolved domestic problems had been steadily growing and aggravating. The political elite, expert community, and mass media had already started an anti-Trump campaign in 2016 that turned into political war. Its peak happened in November 2019 when procedure of impeachment was initiated in the House of Representatives, and was continued in 2021 after Trump left office. The collective monograph "Trump Phenomenon", prepared in INION RAS by a group of well-known specialists in American and international studies, and edited by A. Kuznetsov, a well-known Russian scholar and member correspondent of the Russian academy of sciences, presents a profound inter-disciplinary analysis of contemporary America (7 parts, 37 chapters). The United States remains a superpower, and its global offensive policy exerts visible influence on the course of world development and world order formation. The authors analyze the domestic and foreign policies of the United States during the Trump administration, the social and economic situation, aspects of American political culture, the phenomenon of new populism, and Trump as its manifestation. Debates about Trump will continue. Questions of primary interest are: "How could it happen that a non-systemic candidate emerged in presidential elections and won them with the support of practically 50% of Americans?"; "Why did the mainstream American liberal elite react so outrageously to the results of the elections?"; "Will political crises continue, and what impact could it have on relations with Russia?". Answers to these important questions, and many other questions related to them, can be found in the book.

TI MODERN TRENDS IN UNIVERSITY CITY BRAND MODIFICATION

DE positioning policy; university city; frame; semiosphere; representation

AB This article examines modern trends in the modification of the brand "university city" in the context of communication. The first part is a theoretical analysis based on the main categories of semiotics. Thus, brand modification is considered within the semantic framework of the urban semiosphere, and the brand here means "text" in the interpretation of Yu.M. Lotman. In the context of the authors' concept of the political construction of reality, the generating subject of communication is the party that " writes" the text and also takes care of its coding and understanding. In this regard, the constructivist role, considered through the concepts of "border" and the change of places of the "core" and "periphery" of the urban semiosphere, is transferred from authorities to "active users". At the same time, communication is understood as an equivalent of cultural dialogue with its "translation". This kind of communication moves away from the absolutely linear form of advertising communication of brands and approaches the network configuration of "discussing" brands and giving them values, uniqueness, and thus identity. All this reveals the semiosis of the city brand as a sign and points to the correction of its meaning. Thus, active "users" generate their own "lexicodes" for discussing the topic of the city and spontaneously create a "frame" for the required "university city" and university. The second part of the article reveals the figurative meaning of the " university city" frame by examining the opinions of foreign students. A concrete example of their views regarding a relevant "university city" is shown by a survey of foreign students in Tomsk. The survey revealed the structure of interrelated characteristics that indicate the representative properties of Tomsk and articulate its special significance. In fact, this is a kind of implementation of the right to the city (H. Lefebvre). Empirical research has shown that the image of Tomsk is structured, as it were, on two levels: everyday and symbolic. In general, the form of the generalized image of Tomsk resembles the character of a person, and the city-subject appears as democratic and sociable. The symbolic hypostasis of Tomsk is a city-university, an ideal environment and a favorable place to study at. Thus, based on the culture of dialogue, it is feasible to exchange symbolic positions and create a specific language of communication, in which it is advisable to formulate a semiotically modified idea of a new positioning of the "university city".

SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Max Weber; social science; dialectical rationalism; formal and
   substantive rationality; subjectivity; metaphysics; positivism;
   theology; politics
AB The article analyzes Weber's epistemology of social sciences (including its political characteristics), which is fragmented in form but strives for synthesis in content. It is based on the "negative" concepts of antimetaphysics and antipositivism on the one side, and on the "positive" concepts of subjectivity and dialectical rationalism on the other. Weber substantiates non-metaphysical, secular, rational principles, relying on a dialectical explanation of rationality. Dialectical rationalism (the concept being first introduced relative to Weber) is based on the statement that rationality is the original source of culture and that it generates itself by the interaction of its two internal modes: "substantive" (sets subjective goals) and "formal" (which is operational, "mathematical" rationality, based on objective logic). In his study of religious history, Weber points to the moment when religious goals once became unreachable, which strengthened the formal rationality and made it finally independent in the modern era. According to Weber's logic, rationality is based on rational goal-setting and the denial of a personal God. This approach separated secularism from a materialistic worldview and, contrary to the positivism approach, legalized religion and all other "subjective" worldviews in modern society. All subjective worldviews have become social subsystems, thus protecting them from discoursive persecution but depriving them of political subjectivity. Social sciences have become a mediator between man and culture. Weber, however, failed to give a definitive definition of the source of rationality and religion, which allows us to assume that there is an implicit theological context in his approach. His combination of a dialectical, anti-metaphysical approach with a theological context creates a theology of nihilism, which lacks the ability to formulate both cultural and political programs for the future; this leads to Weber's "pessimism". One of the possible ways out of this situation is the proceeding and expansion of the Weberian program of a theological understanding of the social epistemology.

ID INSTITUTIONALISM
AB The main purpose of the article is to identify a fundamentally important critical points of modern discussions, which aim is to find new theoretical arguments to substantiate the validity of the assumption that classical university idea, its projective dynamics and discursive resources today continue to have a huge impact on the formation of university communities in most regions of the world, despite a large number of obstacles and signs of crisis. The highest priority is to expand the range of sources related to those areas of research of the classical idea of th university, which today play the most important role in its theoretical interpretation. Much attention is paid to various aspects of the concepts of University by W. von Humboldt and J. H. Newman and their analysis in the modern Western scientific and political philosophical tradition. An attempt is made to present all the variety of approaches to the analysis of the idea of university in Western European and North American political theory in the second half of the 20th - early 21st centuries. The structure of the analytical review includes a philosophical analysis of the traditions and principles of university education in the works by M. Oakeshott, M. Adler, J.-F. Lyotard, A. McIntyre, J. Pelikan; sociological concepts of M. Weber, T. Veblen, N. Luhmann, Z. Bauman; political science ideas by A. Flexner, K. Kerr, F. Ringer, M. Hofstetter, S. Fuller, M. Blyth, V.A. Schmidt, R. Sassower, K. Offe, R. Barnett, S. Bengsten, Sh. Rothblatt, B. Wittrock and other scientists. It is very characteristic of modern educational discourse that many discussions around the university idea reproduce similar philosophical and ideological disputes of early modernity, as well as of comparatively recent decades. According to the authors, this trend does not look random: an analysis of the nature of the university and the complex structure of university communities does not always allow one to come to consistent results that can satisfy everyone.

AB At the end of the 19(th) century and the first quarter of the 20(th) century, political parties became the main actors for Russia's social and economic processes and events. During the last three decades, they have been the focus of scholars' efforts since classified sources of the Soviet period were opened for public access at the end of the 20(th) century. Intense scholarship shaped two main approaches to the topic. One focuses on each political party individually, and the other focuses on interactions between all of them. The second approach, even considering its merits, remains limited because relationships are explained mainly through competition between political parties, whereas in reality, connections were more diverse. This article makes a first attempt to show at personal and group levels the transition of former socialists to the Bolshevik party between the February and October revolutions. It identifies specific party leaders and groups that changed their political views and positions; establishes the time and motives for their break with their former parties to join the Bolsheviks; and clarifies the impact of their joining the Bolshevik party. Based on an analysis of questionnaires of delegates who participated in the Sixth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks), the article concludes that by the end of the summer of 1917, the Bolshevik political elite consisted of almost 43 % of former socialists, among whom there was a large proportion of professional revolutionaries. Such human resources, mostly consisting of "left-socialists," contributed to the radicalization of the RSDLP(b), reorienting the political struggle from democratic and political methods to violence and militarism.

DE university city; campus; internationalization; higher education
AB The article covers the peculiarities of French and Siberian university cities' strategies in higher education internationalization. It focuses on the way the university campus is integrated in the city. The authors observe the ways campuses may attract students, especially international ones, taking the examples of the university cities like Bordeaux (France), Tomsk and Novosibirsk (Russia). Bordeaux is ranked among the most student-friendly cities of France. The share of students is about 30% of the city population, the share of international students is about 10.6% of all the students in Bordeaux. The experience of Bordeaux in attracting students is a successful one for several reasons. They are the creation of an inter-university campus, strategic planning together with the city authorities, the solution of students' housing and transportation problems. The creation of a convenient campus is largely supported by the state and local initiatives. The Bordeaux experience seems useful for Tomsk, in which the new inter-university campus and the consortium of universities are being established. Although Tomsk is rather successful in promoting the brand of a student city, it lacks infrastructure making life of students, especially international ones, convenient and secure. However, despite the general decrease of the students' numbers coming to Tomsk, the share of international ones is increasing and makes up to 20% of all Tomsk students. Having compared the two spatial campus models - the localized and the dispersed ones -the authors outlined several advantages and disadvantages of each model applying them to the campuses located in Tomsk and Novosibirsk. Finally, the authors highlight that studentification and higher education internationalization make specific demands towards university city and university campus infrastructure. Therefore, common strategic planning and cooperation between university and city administrations is very much useful. Such cooperation should be aimed at creating necessary housing, transportation facilities and security for students, lecturers and researchers working at the universities.

AB The article provides a review of the scientific works written by the most significant representatives of Staatswissenschaft Russian school - an early statistical science movement, which developed in Russia under the influence of the German university statistics in the late 18th - early 19th centuries. Based on historiographic sources, an analysis of the scientists' opinions about the purpose, subject and methodology of statistical research was carried out. In Russian science theoretical issues of statistical research were first covered in Carl Theodor Hermann's works. He proposed his own methodology for statistical study, a system for statistical description and criticism of sources. Hermann's disciple K.I. Arseniev developed that ideas and used them in his research. Hermann's and Arseniev's studies are considered to be the first works in the emerging political economy direction of Russian statistics. However, the scolar's removal after the "case of professors" and the censorship ban on their textbooks slowed down that school growth. In the next two decades, statisticians continued to work in line with the classical German Staatswissenschaft traditions. The article analyzes E.F. Zyablovsky's and I.A. Geim's theoretical works, which were widely used in the 20-30s of the 19th century. Also shows descriptive school critics' position. It is noted that the main feature of the Russian Staatswissenschaft is the desire to study causal relationships and general laws of society development.

DT Article
DE Turks of Sayan-Altai; wedding rituals; antiques; transformations
AB The main source for this article is the author's field materials on wedding rituals in the Republics of Altai and Khakassia collected in 2017-2019. The materials from the official websites of the Republic of Tuva media and cultural institutions were also used. Based on the archival materials, an attempt was made to consider the preservation of traditional ceremonies and rituals, as well as transformation processes in marriage and family relations among the Sayan- Altai Turks during the Soviet period.
   The data consideration and analysis required descriptive and comparative methods. The synchronous and diachronous methods were used to study changes in a structure of the traditional wedding complex of Altaians, Tuvans, and Khakass, as well as to study transformations, adaptations, and inclusion of innovations caused by political, historical, and socio-economic processes and cultural transformations that occurred in life of the Sayan-Altai Turks. The materials about wedding rituals, identified in various sources and literature, made it possible to reconstruct modern rituals as well as to identify their common and special features.
   The article records an influence of the Soviet reforms on wedding rituals: a new general secular ritual is created during this period. Traditional wedding ceremonies were gradually changing, giving way to the Soviet image, but they did not lose their semantic content. Current materials record general archaic moments reflected in wedding rituals of Sayan-Altai peoples: fire worship, goodwill alkysh, y.reelder, al.ys sozi, a magic circle when newly married go around a yurt 3 times by the sun, the custom to cover a bride's face, the ritual with a bowl of milk, braiding hair, the rite of passage "enezinin sydinin kaargyzhy / emchek kaargysh", "syut agy" / "emjek agy", or "emig kargyzhy" meaning restoration of the bride's mother's breast milk.
   Transformations introduced in modern times are also observed. At weddings, newlyweds and their relatives are dressed in traditional national clothes. In the Altai Republic, in an urban setting, the wedding rituals are practiced in a rented cafe with a traditional ayil (Altai yurt) for all rituals. A tripod hearth is not installed in the modern aiyl, but during a wedding ceremony, a hearth is temporarily or permanently installed.
   The "ayildatyrgani" ceremony, when young people visiting the parents of a daughter-in-law, has undergone a few changes. Today it is held during matchmaking or immediately after the wedding.
   Due to the distance, a use of cars in weddings is also a modern innovation. A few other aspects were recorded: performing ritual songs, people refer to paper sheets with written texts; good wishes follow no particular form and sometimes are given in Russian. In observing traditional weddings one can trace the imitation of rituals or their simplified version in museums of Khakassia and Tuva.
   Nevertheless, museum staff in the modern urbanized conditions is doing a lot to popularize traditional wedding ceremonies and make an attempt to preserve the traditional culture.

AB The article examines the history of the State Conference in Moscow on 12-15 August 1917. This public forum is considered in the context of the corporate policy of the Provisional Government, which attracted various public, professional, national, and other organizations to participate in governing the country. The idea of the Conference began to be implemented only after an attempt to remove the government from power on 3-5 July 1917. In total, the meeting was attended by up to 2,600 people representing the central bodies of the Soviets, former members of the State Duma, various military, economic, food organizations, local government, etc. For four days, the speakers tried to find a common language that would facilitate unification. However, the sessions of the State Conference were held in a conflict atmosphere. During the discussions, the division of the participants into two conventional camps was noticeable. The groups that disagree on several issues can hardly be attributed to the contradiction "bourgeoisie" "democracy". The border between them was not social, but discursive in origin. Nevertheless, serious mutual claims did not allow them to work out a common political program. The author concludes that during the Conference, it was not possible to implement the "pure form" of corporatism and representation of group interests. The main political groups managed to unite a significant part of public and professional organizations around their declarations. The language of the class struggle remained dominant in the discourse of the conference. It was used by very different social groups to describe the varied conflicts of the time.

   Simondon; Lev Vygotsky; Paolo Virno
AB Any political theory is built on the foundation of a certain ontology, an integral part of which is the problem of an individual. For a long time, the ontological primacy in the European thought was attached to the concept of an individual that was understood as a complete and self-sufficient unit. However, today one can talk about the growing popularity of the approach that views an individual as a relative reality in a state of continuous formation i.e., the process of individuation. This approach is developed by the Italian intellectuals, whose general ideological view is known as autonomism (P.Virno, M.Lazzarato, A.Negri etc.). The article examines the origins of the theory of individuation and its political implications within the autonomist thought.
   The first part of the article examines the ways of representing an individual in the ontologies of B.Spinoza and G.Simondon. The author demonstrates that the procedural and relational understanding of an individual proposed by these philosophers contributes to bridging the gap between the collective and the individual not only in politics, but also in thinking. An individual is a consequence of the concretization of the general and retains a connection with it.
   The second part analyzes the psychological and linguistic aspects of individuation, elaborated in L.Vygotsky's psychology and M.Bakhtin's philosophy of dialogue. Individuation is interpreted as a movement from the social to the individual, carried out with the help of various tools, primarily by the means of the language.
   The author evaluates the reception of these thinkers' ideas in the context of autonomism. The author concludes that the autonomist concept of individuation is a synthetic theory that brings together the general aspects of the considered above schools of thought into a single perspective. In fact, the concept is a large-scale revision of the ontological and anthropological foundations of thinking about politics. Its goal is to destroy the idea of a "sovereign individual", which was born within the liberal tradition, and, as a consequence, to liberate the sphere of the collective from the control of capital.

AB The "frozen" borders as a result of the world order established after the Second World War seemed unshakable in Europe and North America, despite the active redrawing of space in other regions. However, the collapse of the dual system of orders in the 1980s and the subsequent active movement of borderlines led to the desire for creating a basis for their fixation. The political will to "stable" the borders coincided with the electoral expectations of stability and order, in this connection, state entities that are not able to oppose a sufficiently stable economic, cultural, and political boundaries to pressure on the borders from outside, in order to preserve the internal social status quo, are forced to create conditions for the preservation of social order, in fact, sacrificing development. The article attempts to explain the "condencing" ("solidifying") borders through the concept of order, which is realized at the mental level in the conservative essentialist worldview, designated in the text as a stable identity. The result of the research was to explain the relationship between the fixation of boundaries in space, the fading of the processes of economic and political development, and the adoption of the conservative model of identity as the most comfortable as an ideal. This allows us to describe many of the processes taking place in public consciousness, and by the presence of one of the outlined elements we can predict the further development of the other two.

AB The article analyzes Vsevolod Ladov's arguments in favor of the interpretation of Wittgenstein's approach to "solving" the paradoxes of self-reference as preferable to the hierarchical approach. It is proved that the unification of Russell's theory of types and Tarski's concept of metalanguage as representatives of the hierarchical approach for solving paradoxes is superficial and leads to the loss of their substantive specificity. It is shown that Wittgenstein's position leads to a significant limitation of the theoretical and proving possibilities of mathematics. It is argued that the proposed interpretation of Wittgenstein's criticism of Russell's theory of types ignores the meaningful context of the complex evolution of Russell's position regarding the paradoxes of set theory and the impact that this evolution had on Wittgenstein's own position. The authors point out the problematic nature of the interpretation of the position of the "early" Wittgenstein as an adequate critique for the solution of the paradoxes of set theory proposed by Russell.

DE thought experiment; imagination; epistemology; methodology of science;
   discourse
AB The article deals with the epistemology of thought experiments. Discussions on thought experiments usually focus on two points: the ability of a thought experiment to produce new knowledge and the possibility of replacing a laboratory experiment with a mental one. In this context, two theoretical positions stand out. The first assumes that a thought experiment is not a material procedure and therefore cannot produce new knowledge if the latter is understood as empirical data (sensory experience). Accordingly, a thought experiment is simply reasoning, a logical argument capable of providing an assessment of a theory for logical consistency, but not capable of performing the main function of a laboratory experiment - to provide access to reality (empirical data). An alternative view of a thought experiment focuses on its similarity to a laboratory experiment in terms of goals and design and defends the possibility of using a thought experiment as a full-fledged methodological replacement for a laboratory experiment, which is crucial for those areas of knowledge where the use of laboratory experiments is difficult or impossible. The discursive (argument) / experimental (sensory experience) dichotomy, which is formed by the noted theoretical positions, seems unproductive for considering a thought experiment since it focuses on the discursive (final) component of a thought experiment and its - supposed by the term - structural-functional similarity with laboratory experimental procedures. At the same time, the peculiarity of the procedural aspect of a thought experiment is overlooked because the persuasiveness and strength of its arguments rely on ocular representation no less than on the logical structure extracted from this representation. Questions about what exactly is imagined in a thought experiment and what the mechanism for choosing details for the formation of a working ("imaginary experimental") representation is can shed light on the epistemological status of a thought experiment and its methodological possibilities. A thought experiment is very close to a cartographic operation: the researcher sketches a mental map, collecting in their imagination an ocular representation of an essential invariant of reality. This operation includes the non-discursive phase of imagination and the discursive phase of the articulation of the invariant the map includes sensory fabric and rules, where the sensory fabric is a product of the imagination and the rules presented in it are judgements (discourse). From this point of view, a thought experiment is a socialization of the imagination - a transition from an always individual imaginary representation to a discursively meaningful representation, i.e. one that is convenient for extracting a formal invariant (rule, contradiction, algorithm, etc.) and correlates with the theoretical standards in force for a given field of knowledge (a paradigm in the sense of T. Kuhn).

DE pastor; priest; Early Modern philosophy; method; subjectivity; truth;
   authority; eloquence
AB Early Modern philosophy pays some attention to the image of minister of religion. While its anticlericalism is well known, the positive program of pastor seems to be neglected. This article considers the structure and grounds of this positive image, concentrating on the texts of Hobbes, Spinoza and Pufendorf. It argues that the universal and yet subjective natural light turns out to be the key element for the image of pastor. The method of mathematical demonstration allows early Modern philosophers to establish the clear and distinct grounds of morality. They demand the same basis for the pastoral care that should consist of teaching and preaching. The same universal and subjective grounds underlie the division of power and authority between sovereign and individual. Consequently, pastor is deprived of any form of power except for the power of demonstration. The doctrine preached by the pastor should be coherent to the natural light. The use of eloquence or any (other) form of coercion is not allowed for him. Otherwise this doctrine is designated as superstition, i.e. political, moral and epistemic evil. This kind of reasoning brings the pastor under control of instances of the reason (represented e.g. by the philosophers) and the sovereign. Finally, the assumption is made that the structure of this ideal Early Modern pastor sets the limits of rational-legal order of authority of the religious leader.

AB After the World Health Organization recognized the situation with the spread of the new coronavirus infection as critical, a huge array of a wide variety of studies, mainly of applied value, appeared. Many of these studies are devoid of a methodological basis and semantic grounds because not enough time has passed for a fundamental understanding of what and how to study. For the correct understanding of the essence and real state of the social well-being of medical workers, a system of both internal and external control is required. Internal control is a key task of state health policy at the federal, regional, and municipal levels. External control is the prerogative of third-party public and scientific organizations capable of representing the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of social processes in the health care sector, giving them a neutral and objective assessment. A rational form of external control is the sociological diagnosis of the effects of the pandemic, both for public health and for the social and mental health of certain professional groups. The task of modern sociology is to quantitatively and qualitatively measure components of social health of the professional medical community, the integral criterion of which is social well-being as a subjective perception and assessment by an individual medical worker of the level of their achievements, degree of realization of their needs, and the effectiveness of their life strategy, taking into account the sociocultural context (at the micro- and macrolevel) and objective factors (vectors of social policy of the state, situation in health care and public health, rhetoric of the mass media, and level of education in society). The concept of social well-being is closely related to the phenomenon of social adaptation. Merton's conceptual scheme of social adaptation (with a slight change in the sequence of types with an emphasis on the constructiveness of behavior models, rather than their anomalousness) is used to study the types of behavior of medical workers in a complex epidemiological situation. The theoretical significance of the typologization of social adaptation models is to reduce the conglomerate of behavioral acts and individual life worlds of medical workers to simplified scientific constructs for the correct understanding of the current situation and development of tools for social work with the professional medical community if there is a real need for them. The concept of social adaptation allows considering social well-being not as some kind of artificial objective reality, but as a dynamic characteristic of the actor's professional thinking.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE miracle; sovereign power; law; state of emergency; decision; will;
   providential governance
AB The article justifies the approach to the essence of sovereign power from the point of view of the Western Christian theological paradigm. In this regard, the author considers the "miraculous" aspect of the power of the sovereign, derived from the idea of the absolute power of God, whose volitional decision is capable of limiting/suspending the operation of natural laws in the manifested form of a miracle. In the most general sense, a miracle is understood as a divine act that is extraordinary (exceptional) in nature, an act that interrupts the usual phenomenological series, proclaims the will of God and has the property of "salvation". Thus, the theological concept of a miracle turns out to be a paradigm of secular sovereign power, based on the exclusive right to decide on a state of emergency. The concept of sovereignty, which includes the notion of the absoluteness and indivisibility of the supreme power, has a theological origin, since absolute power can only be an attribute of an absolute being, that is, God. The secularization and politicization of theological concepts build sovereign power on the basis of the equality between the sovereign and God, giving the state ruler the place that God occupied in the universe. The personified image of the sovereign represents a logically necessary completion of the hierarchical system of power. The transformation of the monarchic principle of sovereign power into the people's democratic one leads to the formation of an administrative-bureaucratic state, where the criterion of sovereignty is not legitimacy, but the effectiveness of managerial actions, which involves the permanent use of emergency measures. The "salvation" of God's miraculous actions finds its manifestation in the "salvific" purpose of emergency measures aimed at ensuring public safety by preventing fictitious threats. The totalization of the threat establishes a mode of functioning of the sovereign power, which within an exception to the law ("a miracle") becomes equal to the law.

AB The subject of the article is the application of the concept of the form of state in the Soviet historical and legal science.
   The purpose of the research is to confirm or disprove the hypothesis that the understanding of the form of the state in the Soviet history of law was not discrete, it changed under the influence of political transformations and had a significant impact on the modern theory of the state.
   The methodology. The method of periodization was used to highlight the Soviet period of historical and legal science, the chronological method was used to determine the upper and lower boundaries of the Soviet period. The narrative method made it possible to describe the historiographic process. The historical-comparative method was required to compare individual concepts.
   Results, scope of application. The concept of the form of the state that was used in the historical and legal science of the Soviet period has been determined. The form of the state in Soviet science included two elements initially: the form of government and the form of statehood. The third element has been added since the 1960s - the political regime. The institutionalization of the history of state and law as a science took place by the end of the 1940s. While historians of the old school were working, the main topics included the early stages of the development of the state. Then after the change of generations the priority place was taken by the problems of the Soviet state. By the end of the Soviet period a more harmonious allocation of topics had developed. In Soviet historical and legal science the form of the state of the pre-revolutionary and Soviet periods was considered separately. The form of government of the Russian state in the pre-revolutionary period was defined as a monarchy. Several types of monarchy were distinguished: early feudal, estate-representative, absolute. The republican form of government was recognized for the Soviet state. Its class and social essence changed with the development of socialism. Organizational forms changed accordingly. When studying the polity, the main attention was paid to the federation. Its complex origin was noted, because the Russian Federation (RSFSR) was part of the federation of the USSR. The Soviet federations were built according to the nationalterritorial principle. The issue of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation remained debatable. Most researchers considered the RSFSR a state with autonomous entities. The development of the territory of the state as a whole has hardly been studied. Major administrative-territorial reforms carried out in the 1920s-1930s were considered in isolation from national-territorial construction. Generalized works on the territorial development of the state appeared only at the end of the Soviet period. Issues of the political regime of the feudal and bourgeois state were addressed in the study of direct democracy in the ancient Russian state, estate representative bodies, state power during the period of absolutism. Political liberalization was noted during the bourgeois reforms of the second half of the 19th - early 20th centuries. The democratic nature of the Soviet political regime was not questioned, therefore, the problems indicating trouble, crisis phenomena in the Soviet state were not identified.
   Conclusions. The understanding of elements of form of the state in the Soviet history of law was expanding. It changed in accordance with the changes in the Soviet governance. The main approaches to understanding the form of the state are accepted by contemporary Russian science.

AB The qualitative changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic at all levels of the organization of the world community (individual, group, national, global) have actually formed a new social reality. Moreover, this process was of a force majeure nature; it took place in the conditions of a sharp increase in the uncertainty feeling, changes in the lifestyle of almost every person and every particular family, the unpreparedness of world medicine for an adequate response to the global epidemiological challenge, as well as the inevitability of large-scale problems in the economy and politics. The current conditions have become a challenge for the existing systems of public administration. The governments of different countries had to act quickly and decisively in order, on the one hand, to keep the development of the epidemiological situation under control, and on the other hand, to prevent a sharp deterioration of social stability against the background of objectively emerging epidemiological, social and psychological challenges. While the world medicine was urgently accelerating the development of a vaccine against coronavirus infection, the scientific and political community discussed the general strategy for implementing quarantine restrictions. However, against this background, the local community level remained virtually behind the scenes, which, nevertheless, was and still remains the most practical in terms of interaction of population with the authorities. It is at the local level (meaning the regional level, as well as the level of local self-government) that the authorities are more close to the society problems, have the opportunity to interact face-to-face with its representatives, and the population, in turn, can actually participate in activities to improve living conditions (including solving problems caused by the pandemic). The article presents the experience of Russia and China in organizing interaction and evaluating the activities of local authorities by the population. Both countries have shown high efficiency in overcoming the crisis in 2020-2021, so their experience is of considerable interest, primarily in practical terms. The authors of the study have concluded about the importance of public assessment regarding the effectiveness of the activities of local authorities, as well as the prospects for actively involving citizens in solving problems arising against the background of force majeure.

DE ethnic conflict; form of government; presidentialism; parliamentarism;
   semi-presidentialism; ethnic representation
ID POLITICAL-INSTITUTIONS; PRESIDENTIALISM; DEMOCRATIZATION
AB Ethnic conflicts are a danger to the stability and integrity of a state; to prevent and resolve these, the state changes the form of political-territorial structure, the electoral system, or the form of government. The purpose of the article is to provide a critical overview of current discussions in political science regarding the relationship between ethnic conflicts and forms of government. The author focuses on two key points: the influence of ethnicity on the form of government; and the influence of the form of government on ethnic conflict. The choice of the form of government in a divided society is determined by the conceptual approach: supporters of consociationalism believe that the parliamentary system, due to its collegial nature, is the desired design of power in a multi-ethnic society; supporters of centripetalism and power-dividing approach, on the contrary, advocate for the presidential system, since it provides group consensus as well as checks and balances. One of the poorly studied research problems is to find out what is the role of presidential, parliamentary, and semi-presidential systems in resolving ethnic conflicts. The author claims that the impact of the form of government on ethnicity is ambiguous. There are sufficient arguments in favor of the fact that the presidential system reduces the risk of ethnic conflicts and favors ethnic peace and harmony, but at the same time leads to low chances of political representation for ethnic groups. On the other hand, the parliamentary system creates more opportunities for ethnic representation, but increases the risks of ethnic conflicts. The author demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of various forms of government in the context of ethnic contradictions. At the same time, he notes that the form of government is not a determinant of ethnic conflicts, but only a condition, since historical, social, and cultural factors have a stronger impact on ethnic conflicts.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the political process of Germany's abandonment of nuclear energy. The results of a comparative analysis of government decisions taken over the course of one decade, but different m nature and having different consequences for the nuclear industry are presented in the paper. Special attention is paid to the issue of interaction between the government and energy companies in the context of the decisions of 2002 and 2011. It is shown that the abandonment of atomic energy in 2002 was a compromise solution, taking into account both the political desire of society to stop the operation of the nuclear power plant, and the economic interests of energy concerns. The author analyzes the consequences of the unilateral decision of the FRG government in 2011. infringing on the interests of the nuclear lobby, which led to many years of litigation that ended in favor of energy concerns. A review of the final compromise agreements between the companies and the government governing the issue of lair compensation for the early shutdown of nuclear power plants was carried out. Based on a comparative analysis of the two decisions on Germany's withdrawal from nuclear energy and their consequences, it is concluded that, when entire industries are closed for political reasons, consultations with the involvement of all interested parties are necessary to work out an acceptable compromise.

DT Article
DE terrorism; criminological theory; terrorism offences
AB The article deals with the algorithm for assessing the research value of individual theories of causality of terrorism offences. Various research schools developed several main directions, which explain the reasons for terrorism offences. Mostly, these theories are convincing both theoretically and empirically, and it is problematic to explain many of them. The result of the study is the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of social theories of the causality of terrorism offences.
   In the study, we used such general scientific methods as analysis, synthesis, and a system structural method. We also used such specific scientific methods as biographical analysis, statistical analysis, comparative-historical and expert assessment.
   The article comes to several conclusions below.
   Among the factors, with the help of which it is advisable to determine the value of the theory of causality of terrorism offences were political and doctrinal biases.
   Political and doctrinal biases were among the factors by which it is advisable to determine the value of the theory of causality for terrorist-related crimes.
   The political bias of a criminological theory is compliance with the needs and perception of the world of the most active social groups that form the social request to the science from society.
   The doctrinal bias of the criminological theory is the conformity to the interests and the main provisions of the doctrine as a source of law and legal science.
   The theory of anomy by E. Durkheim cannot apply to terrorism. Within the framework of this theory, one of the basic statements is the idea that crime can be a factor in integrating society, the strengthening of social ties. It is difficult to see an integrative social component in modern revolutionary separatist and expansionist.
   The theories of differentiated communication of E. Sutherland and D. Cressey concerning terrorism are not applicable. The principal postulate of this theory says that the more a person interacts with the criminal environment, the higher is the probability of his antisocial infestation. However, the thesis that most terrorists come from a criminal or close to a criminal environment is not confirmed by anything, even if we talk only about the ordinary members of terrorist organizations.
   The research vector, focused on the multifactorial analysis of criminological theories, will contribute to their deeper scientific understanding at the theoretical level, and more effective application at the practical one. One of the main ideas is the thesis about the targeting of each theory of the causality of terrorism offences.

AB The present review analyses key ideas of professor Mikhail Antonov's 2021 book on formalism, decisionism and conservatism in Russian Law. This review essay is written in the form of an imaginary dialogue between the reviewer (a political philosopher) and the author (legal philosopher). Its main aim is to explore legal dimensions of Russia's new ideology of conservatism. Divided into five sections, it covers five conceptual foundations of the book - sovereigntism, statism, collectivism, civilizationism and exceptionalism. This review essay also examines the links between the respective ideas of legal philosophy of Mikhail Antonov and an overview of arguments from the contemporary political and critical international theory, aiming to engage in a critical discussion with the author about Russia's insecure collective identity.

AB The paper highlights two perspectives of considering the issues of Russian civilizational identity - historical and those associated with a modern socio-philosophical and socio-political discourse. The purpose of the study of given problematics is to form a reliable picture of the country's past, which would reflect all the essential civilizational foundations, both autochthonous and external civilizational influences on Rus-Russia. There are two approaches to understanding the problems of Russian civilizational identity from a historical perspective: attempts to build an identity in a truncated form by pointing to one or more historical influences that shaped civilizational identity, and attempts to present the Russian civilizational identity in fullfledged form. As to the concepts of the second group, significant importance is attached to the civilizational influences on the original East Slavic civilizational tradition, and later on Rus`-Russia as a mechanism for the formation of an alloy of heterogeneous components of the Russian civilizational identity. In addition to historical research, the second productive direction of examining the issues of Russian civilizational identity is socio-philosophical. A fairly common use of argumentation related to the topic of Russian civilizational identity has a very limited meaning, since one mostly talks about political and ideological speculations.

AB The article analyzes the state and prospects for the development of the legislative regulation of public administration in the Russian Federation. Under the influence of the constitutional reform, the pandemic of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), digitalization and other international and national political, social, and other factors, the problem of effective public administration is becoming more acute. In the conditions of modern challenges and emergency situations, there is a transition to the next stage of modernization of the government system of the Russian state, the evolution of modern doctrinal ideas about the state and the ways of its further development. New legislative initiatives and doctrinal projections of the possible and desirable variant of the development of the state apparatus and related political and legal processes are being developed. The problem of separating short-term and long-term tasks of state development, updating the methodology for linking strategic documents are being actualized. Based on the analysis and evaluation of the most important systemic and complex legal decisions in the field of public administration (both adopted and drafted), doctrinal projections of the optimal development of the legislative regulation of public administration management, it is concluded that the successful political and legal development of our country is largely due not only to the quality of legal support for public administration, better effectiveness of the state and its bodies, but also to the development of the methodology of interconnection and correlation of strategic planning documents and legislative regulation. The need to further strengthen the state is associated with greater effectiveness of legislation in this area, smart regulation, the development and adoption of new laws that allow improving the activities of state bodies and are aimed at improving the effectiveness of public administration. It is noted that ensuring the effectiveness and quality of the designed normative legal acts is their doctrinal justification based on the predictive tools of modern legal science, a scenario approach to the development of existing political and legal events and processes in the future for the short and long term, which allows planning their development and predicting the onset of political, legal and other risks.

AB The article attempts to analyze some factors that, in the author's opinion, may more or less significantly affect the fate and prospects of D. Trump and his legacy - a set of ideas, program guidelines, forms, methods, means of restructuring the socio-political life and the power system of the United States, which became known under the collective name "Trumpism". The main attention is focused on substantiating the thesis that the victory of D. Trump, who in the context of the political realities of the United States could be regarded as an outsider, in the presidential elections in November 2016, was not a historical accident, but a natural result of deep shifts in infrastructures of the American society. After analyzing the objective and subjective factors of the struggle for power and the right to choose the paths and prospects of the socio-historical development of the United States between Trumpism and the political platform of J. Biden, the leader of the Democrats, it was concluded that all possible attempts to neutralize and push the Trump legacy to the periphery of social and political life appear to be insolvent. The author sees the essence of the problem in the fact that in the presidential elections of both 2016 and 2020 it was a question of voting for/against not just specific candidates from the Republican and Democratic Parties, but under conditions of a deep crisis, in support of or against the program of social and political development of the country. In the 2020 elections, D. Trump and J. Biden were viewed by the majority of voters as symbols of defenders and opponents of the dominant political, intellectual, media establishment, as well as the so-called "Washington swamp" and a "deep state". Since the factors that prompted 74 million Americans to vote for Trump have not disappeared, the Democrats led by J. Biden will have to rule America with these realities in mind.

AB Politicians in all types of regimes require bureaucracy to extend their rule over society. To prevent administrators from becoming too powerful and publicly signal independence, they seemingly arbitrarily criticize public officials. But when and how do political leaders blame bureaucracy - and when do they praise it ? This study uses Russia as a case to illustrate the complex and ambiguous politics-administration relationship in non-Western regimes. We argue that public statements about bureaucracy accommodate two different legitimation strategies. We provide a content analysis of 311 public statements, from 1917 - 2017, on the role of administration in the country's development. We find that attention to administrative affairs coincides with major political changes and periods of political instability in the history of Soviet and post-Soviet Russia. Over a century, the rhetoric of Russian leaders oscillated between blaming and praising bureaucracy to secure stability and overcome obstacles in implementing governing strategies. The strategic interplay between assertive rhetoric and praising bureaucracy is part of an effective political leadership survival strategy.

AB The author of the article focuses on understanding the problems that have arisen (mainly in Russia) in connection with the creation, production and distribution of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2; previously 2019-nCoV - novel coronavirus), which causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The origins of the vaccination situation in the country are associated with the antivaccination movement in general and its Russian specifics. The study was carried out during a pandemic from the standpoint of medical and anthropological approaches (using "qualitative" methods of analysis) on the material of Internet sources, mainly networks, and surveys of respondents of different sex, age, social and educational status. The identified problems can be grouped into several blocks: assessment by potential consumers of the production of domestic vaccines - their quality, the degree of approbation before entering the market; development of a strategy for their use (varying at different stages) - acceptance of the idea of vaccination or rejection of it for various reasons; the choice of the timing of vaccination and a specific vaccine; reactions to the consequences of vaccination; attitude towards the vaccination campaign (including legislative messages and campaigning) at different stages. All of them are in one way or another associated with political, medical and cultural contexts; any of them involved both specialists (politicians, doctors of various levels - including prominent scientists, as well as cultural figures), and ordinary citizens who found themselves in a difficult situation of choice and decision-making. The article, in addition to a general understanding of the problems, offers illustrative materials to assess the peculiarities of attitudes towards vaccination of various individuals and groups of the population.

TI Kuraika-2 funeral-memorial complex in South-Eastern Altai: new materials

AB The article presents the results of the study and cultural and chronological interpretation of excavations at the Kuraika-2 burial-memorial complex. This monument is located in South-Eastern Altai and was studied by the expedition of Gorno-Altaisk State University in 2016. The analysis of the features of the above-ground and intra-grave structures of the barrow 1 and fence 2 as well as the recorded elements of ritual practices allowed us to attribute these objects to the archaeological culture of the Early Medieval Turks. The study of the accompanying inventory, including mainly horse harness and jewelry items, as well as the results of radiocarbon dating have provided a basis for determining the chronology of the excavated structures within the framework of the middle-second half of the 8th century A.D. The materials of the Kuraika-2 complex confirm the earlier conclusions that the Turks continued to live in Altai after the collapse of the Second East Turkic Kaganate and the designated region was not included in the Uigur state. The investigated woman's burial which contains rather valuable non-ferrous metal items demonstrates the preservation by separate groups of Turks of a rather high status in the system of socio-political hierarchy of the nomads of the Central Asian region during the investigated period. Apparently one of such groups of nomads lived in Southeastern Altai, as evidenced both by the published materials and by the results of excavations of other monuments in this territory. The detailing of various aspects of the history of the Altai Turks in the Uigur time is connected both with the further field studies, and with the publication of the materials of the past years' excavations, some of which were introduced into the scientific circle rather fragmentarily.

AB The paper aims to present two paradigms of theory of globalization: traditional and novel. First paradigm includes globalizations concepts concerned with the investigation of the material aspect of the process of globalization. Within the boundaries of this paradigm various concepts of globalization can be fit into a conceptual frame which includes the following main concept: historical, geopolitical, economic, social, legal, political globalization.
   Historically, the process of globalization is connected with the evolution of the global world community. This consideration bring to the Global Enlightenment problem, which excel narrow interpretation of the Classical Enlightenment of the 18 C. -mainly inspired by national and historical narratives.
   Social globalizations concepts investigate various trends of social world evolution: westernization, colonization, modernization, post-modernization, running behind development. In contemporary social theory several basic elements of globalization are indentified: deterritorialization: interconnectedness across existing geographical and political borders: speed of velocity of social activity, evaluation of globalization as a relatively long-term process, understanding of globalization as multi-pronged process.
   Legal concepts of globalization investigate the prospect of "good society" and "responsible community" formation within the boundaries of the globalization process.
   Political theorists have been busy addressing the normative implication of globalization. Globalization is discussed in debates between cosmopolitans and communitarians.
   At whole, first paradigm of the globalization theory is oriented on investigation mainly material aspect of modern globalization process: economical, geopolitical, social, etc.
   The second paradigm of globalization theory is concerned with investigation of the recent process of cultural development: informatization, digitalization, net culture, virtual culture, additional reality, diversity, multicultural trends of development, hybridity, hybrid geopolitics.
   Multicultural concepts of globalization, based on the recognition of the world diversity, are popular because of their non-repressive and tolerant forms.
   Virtual reality becomes dominant phenomena in recent culture, creating the "third nature" world of virtual phenomena created by synthesis of intelligence and high technologies. This third nature exists side by side with two traditional worlds: nature and culture (the second nature, in terms of F. Schelling).
   Informatization, digitalization, net structures, virtual and additional reality lead to great changes of existence of human being. Human being exists in two dimensions: real and virtual with domination of virtual. Virtual, informational, net structures transform modern globalization process. Global nets lead to realization of human freedom as free choice of life style, which remains open.
   In conclusion authors stress the fact of existing of two paradigm in theory of globalization: traditional, oriented on investigation of material phenomena (historical, geopolitics, economic, social, etc. concepts) and novel oriented of analysis of immaterial phenomena (virtual, digital, hybrid, multicultural, informational, net, etc.).

DE evolutionary linguistics; macrosocial patterns; geopolitics; geoculture;
   geoeconomics
AB The aim of the article is to unite into a single conceptual whole studies of glottogenesis as the origin and early evolution of languages during the formation of Homo Sapiens and in preliterate epochs of prehistory, studies of the political evolution of tribes, chiefdoms, polities, studies of the formation of states, empires, world-economies, civilizational analysis, historical sociolinguistics, reconstruction of proto-languages - areas of research that are very heterogeneous and still almost isolated from each other. The main difficulty of the approach is the lack of direct data (empirical material) about linguistic evolution in the preliterate era. Therefore, the construction of a holistic picture of linguistic evolution is forced to rely on general macrosocial patterns, ethnographic analogies, and their comparison with indirect data from such areas as paleoclimatology, paleogeography, archeology, sociolinguistics. Not so much the conclusions as the most probable scenarios and patterns of global linguistic evolution are reconstructed on these foundations as follows. The African "cauldron of sapientation" up to 80-70 thousand years ago functioned thanks to the interaction of many groups of hominids and strict selection between them. The effect of the "volcanic winter" catastrophe approximately 74 thousand years ago led to depopulation as a result of which groups and alliances of early Sapiens (about 200 linguistic communities) with the highest level of cognitive abilities survived in Africa. This level was distinguished by the already fully developed languages, with which the Sapiens began to settle in Eurasia, on other continents, on the islands of Oceania. Probably, these ancient languages became the progenitors of all languages known today, traditionally united in 150-200 language families. It is shown that the further evolution of languages was closely associated with the political evolution according to Robert Carneiro (from villages and chiefdoms to states and empires). More or less well-known features of the societies and languages of North American Indians are used as an analogy for the social and linguistic evolution of the Sapiens in Eurasia. A summary of the known patterns of linguistic changes due to geopolitical, geocultural and geoeconomic shifts, as well as in connection with social dynamics within societies is presented. The main roles were played by conquests, resettlements, military-political alliances, religious and trade relations, and marriage policy. In societies, languages are influenced in a certain way by shifts in class and estate structure, in interethnic relations. Particular attention is paid to the transition to writing. Mastering writing has always been a creative process in which heterogeneous elements of the linguistic environment were used. Partly because of the prevailing political and cultural configuration, partly because of random and subjective factors, one or another language option was chosen, or, most likely, it was some kind of a compromise from the available options. It is this compromise variant that became the official national language, while the rest (previously equated to it) variants remained in the status of dialects.

TI The Concept "Taiga" in the Siberian Discourse of the 19th Century and

DT Article
DE taiga; forest; Siberia; conceptual history; sociocommunicative landscape
AB This article is a continuation of the study of the history of the concept "taiga" in the Siberian discourse of the 19th century. Its aim is to identify the key images associated with this concept and the key sociocultural, political, and economic factors influencing the transformation of the concept in the last third of the 19th century. During this period, the relevance of the "Siberian theme" is growing in the social thought of Russia. This happens due to the beginning of mass migration to the region and the acceleration of its economic development, which led to the growth of regional self-awareness, the further development of the Siberian theme in fiction, the intensification of the activities of various social and political forces, etc. The questions of what place the concept of taiga occupies in Siberian discourse in connection with the growth of colonization and public attention to Siberia at the end of the 19th century are investigated. What is the peculiarity of the perception of Russian and Siberian forests? In turn, how can the perception of nature explain the peculiarities of the colonization of Siberia? Finally, what place does the taiga occupy in the search for identity in Russian society, and how did competing discourses influence the perception of the taiga? The material is journalistic texts, reports of travelers and Siberian officials, forestry literature, and fiction of this period. The research methods are the tools of humanitarian geography, the history of concepts, and the sociology of nature. As a result of the study, it was revealed that the concept of taiga during this period is interpreted as the antithesis of the Russian forest. The concept is used to substantiate the reasons for the existence of regional differences in Siberians. The taiga forms the basis of the Siberian landscape: the forest in central Russia is embedded in the existing landscape, makes up only a part of it and seems conquered, while the taiga is the Siberian landscape, which includes everything else, including the Siberian forest and settlements. The concept develops in numerous works of the last third of the 19th century and becomes central to the understanding of the isolated society, closed from and for the rest of the world by nature itself: the world of Siberian workers, exiles, fugitive prisoners, migrants, and old-time peasants, representatives of indigenous peoples. By the end of the century and the beginning of the mass agricultural development of the region, the taiga forms a nature-conquering discourse. The mythologem about the infinity of the taiga and the impossibility of its development is rethought. This discourse becomes fundamental in the following decades and acquires an official status.

AB The article deals with the national and collective pandemic responses at the early stage of the COVID-19 spread in Europe. It is noted that the European Union was not ready for such a cataclysm, despite the history of the spread of serious infectious diseases and the presence of special services and road maps. The virus that began to circulate in Asia, was not initially perceived by the EU representatives as a real threat. Moreover, its leadership ignored the voices of some member states of the Union, focusing on solving other problems. In turn, the countries left without Brussels' attention began to counteract the new Coronavirus independently, using the anti-crisis tools that were prescribed in the existing pandemic plans. The existence of such national programs determined the specificity of the measures taken in the very first days. The author identifies three models of the EU member states' behavior. The first one was common for the states of the so-called "political core of the EU" which refused to adopt strict lockdown measures due to their unwillingness to weaken democracy, violate human rights and limit civil liberties. The second group, comprised mainly of the EU-11 countries, imposed severe measures. The author sees the rationale for this step in the fact that local authorities doubted the capabilities of national health systems in passing a pandemic stress test. The third group includes states that have chosen the way of achieving herd immunity - the most controversial option of resistance to viral infection, that has not proven its effectiveness. The article demonstrates that the period of growing national egoism was followed by a stage of decisive measures by the central authorities of the EU. They were able to develop a suitable package of measures that took into consideration the interests of the most affected countries of the Union. The consolidation of the EU after a temporary weakening became possible due to the "reset" of the Franco-German tandem.

DE university; liquid modernity; postmodernity; identity; knowledge
   production; research; education; social responsibility
AB The object of the research presented in the article is the transformation of the university's identity in the context of "liquid modernity" (Zygmunt Bauman), as an era of global instability. Despite political, economic and social upheavals and changes, the university remained a fairly stable, albeit evolving, social institution from its inception during the Middle Ages to the second half of the 20th century, to the stage of social development that is commonly called postmodernity or "liquid modernity". At this time, higher education almost all over the world is faced with a reduction in public funding, and a need arises for universities to search for additional sources of income. As a result, a model of an entrepreneurial university is emerging, the social role and institutional identity of the university in modern reality is blurred (Bill Readings "the university in ruins"). In the situation of the problematization of the university's integral identity and the emergence of multiple models in which it functions today, it becomes necessary to rethink the uniqueness of the university as a social institution and its place and role in the world. The article carries out a reflexive analysis of the transformation of the university's identity in three key dimensions: first, as an agent for the development of research open to innovation and social activity; second, as an educational project in the era of mass (and possibly universal) higher education; third, as a subject that bears social responsibility for contributing to the sustainable development of a changing world. The study of transformations of the identity of a modern university is based on the analysis of changes in the concept of knowledge from the perspective of the concept of "liquid modernity". These transformations were indicated by an increase in the need for expert scientific knowledge, simultaneously with its relativization, the accumulation of uncertainties and risks, a paradigmatic shift from a fundamentalist type of science to research in which knowledge is epistemologically and socially constructed. An analysis of the transformations affecting the university in its key areas of activity - research, teaching, and social responsibility - shows how significant they are. Indeed, one might get the impression that the university is losing its place in the world and its identity; however, transformations of the basic functions of the university do not mean the loss of the university's uniqueness, but rather a renewal of the ideal. The authors of the article come to the conclusion that the identity of the university as a social institution is expressed in the unity of the functions of research, teaching, and social responsibility. This unique integrity allows the university to produce and broadcast knowledge as a social good, realizing its responsible research and expert position in the interests of the well-being of the larger world and overcoming civilizational crises, and this is what distinguishes the university from other social institutions.

ID PARTICIPATION
AB The growing influence of social media has significantly affected various aspects of sociopolitical life, including social movements and protest activity. Social networks are becoming a part of everyday life, influencing the processes of media consumption. Traditional media are no longer the main source of news, being replaced by social media. Users of social networks largely build their individual agenda setting, forming their own news feed, subscribing to a particular virtual community (media, parties, etc.). Realizing this, the latter are trying to make use of it by creating virtual communities on social networks. Over the past decade, observers have noted that social networks are beginning to play a significant role in public life in Russia. In this regard, the problem of user behavior in various social networks seems to be important for research, including such an important component of everyday life as news consumption. This work analyzes news consumption patterns of members of virtual communities created on the VKontakte social network in connection with one of the most noticeable socio-ecological conflicts of the last decade around the construction of a landfill in Shies. In this study, the author planned to compare members of "anti-garbage" communities and members of territorial communities (Arkhangelsk Oblast and the Komi Republic) in relation to news consumption. He decided to limit the scope to two areas of news consumption by community members: environmental and political agendas. Interest in the environmental agenda could be expressed by joining virtual environmental communities. Similarly, interest in the political agenda could be expressed by joining communities offering political news. In addition, members of "anti-garbage" communities were surveyed in relation to the extent to which they followed the most notable protest events of the past year, not related to the environmental agenda. The study revealed the difference between members of communities created in connection with the Shies landfill project from members of territorial communities in their interest in various federal virtual communities offering political news. The analysis showed that the agenda setting of members of "anti-garbage" communities, in comparison with the agenda setting of members of territorial communities, formed by an individual news feed, is more alternative to the official agenda. Users interested in news in connection with an acute socio-ecological conflict are more interested in news provided by "independent" media and opposition political movements. In this regard, we can speak about the greater politicization of citizens concerned about the acute environmental conflict. The analysis also revealed a connection between the agenda setting formed by virtual communities and the interest of members of "anti-garbage" communities in protest events that go far beyond the environmental agenda.

AB Introduction. Recent trends in the sphere of internationalisation of higher education expand theoretical insights into the dialectical nature of correlation between pedagogical science and educational practice, as well as the relationship between the general directions of the development of higher education, its national and regional specifics. An analysis of the experience of internationalisation of universities is required for the development of various models to modernise higher education, including legal education, and to substantiate practical recommendations for reforming the Russian higher education system. To date, an understanding has been reached of the need to internationalise higher education in the context of globalisation to increase the competitiveness of the Russian higher education system, as evidenced by the Federal project to maximise the competitive position of Russian universities among the world's leading scientific and educational centres (The Russian Academic Excellence Project 5-100). internationalisation, being the key to optimising the export potential of Russian higher education, is essential for the modernisation of legal education.
   Aim. The research aimed to evaluate the productivity of actual instruments of international cooperation between universities and to outline optimal approaches to the usage of successful practices of international and Russian educational space to enhance the attractiveness of Russian legal education, and, as a consequence, the creation of a sustainable competitive advantage of a higher education institution.
   Methodology and research methods. Complex, interdisciplinary goals and tasks of the present research predetermined the application of gnoseological and synergetic approaches to the selection of research tools. The gnoseological approach facilitated a more profound analysis of the nature of internationalisation and integration of education in the current international processes. The synergetic approach resulted in the integration of pedagogical and legal research methods to define an optimal internationalisation strategy for the training of multiskilled legal professionals.
   Results. The authors assessed the effectiveness of the existing ways of internationalisation of Russian legal education according to foreign student demand. A comprehensive analysis of the legal, political and social aspects of the current state of attractiveness of the Russian market of educational services and the need to identify the specifics of the internationalisation of higher legal education was carried out. The experience monitoring of inter-university international cooperation allowed the authors to determine the conditions for the effectiveness of joint legal programmes (creation of an innovative educational environment, project activities and a flexible management system); to analyse modern pedagogical technologies applicable to legal disciplines; to determine the best schemes used by Russian and European universities for external mobility of students and teachers; to develop the proposals for the introduction of disciplines (for Russian students) provided in foreign languages by Russian and foreign teachers; to propose measures to improve the state policy in the field of interest, aimed at stimulating Russian universities to develop international joint educational programmes.
   Scientific novelty. The article presented the analysis of positive and negative experiences of Russian universities in application of internationalisation key tools in legal higher education. The acknowledged internationalisation methods of higher education were systematised in general. The additional ways for the integration of Russian legal education, in particular, to the international educational space, were identified.
   Practical significance consists in the approbation of new methods based on competency and practice-oriented approaches. The authors developed the guidelines for the implementation of internationalisation to enhance university competitive advantage and to increase the demand for graduates in labour market.

AB In this article, the responses of foreign scientists to the jubilee commemoration dedicated to the 220th anniversary of the USSR Academy of Sciences (June 15-30, 1945) are analyzed. The aim of this article is to clarify the trend of reformatting the communicative field of science in a unique historical period suffused with the pathos of the Victory, fresh memories of the joint struggle within the anti-Hitler coalition, hopes for building a better world. The source basis of the study is representative. It includes interviews of foreign guests published both in the Soviet Union and abroad, ego sources, reports, and questionnaires. Many of them were collected and preserved in the papers of the All-Union Committee for the 220th Anniversary of the USSR Academy of Sciences in the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences (No. 519) and among the personal papers of Academician V.L. Komarov (No. 277). One of the reports of the British delegation is preserved among the personal papers of Sir Henry Dale in the Archives of the Royal Society. V.S. Gruzdinskaya, one of the authors of this article, and M. V. Kovalev co-published this document. The indicated subject is studied fragmentary in modern historiography, the exception is an article by N.A. Kuperstoch, "The image of science in the post-war world: the anniversary conference of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences in June 1945", which analyzes the responses to the anniversary in the framework of one of the sessions. The anniversary is treated as a communicative platform. In the present article, it allows clarifying the ideas and concepts of national-state science and the ideas of academic internationalism, which involves the use of methods of social and intellectual history. In the space of the anniversary, the idea of a common world science was expressed clearly. Science is international by nature and cannot be confined within the borders of one country. Programs for the formation of a common communicative space were proposed. It was planned to organize an international scientific publishing house, an international abstract journal, an intensive exchange of scientists and students, holding of symposiums, conferences, seminars, and unification of the scientific language. The idea of institutionalizing the "unity of science" emerged. Joseph Needham, an English biochemist, put forward an initiative to create an International Service for Scientific Cooperation. He prepared a memorandum, "The Place of Science and International Scientific Cooperation in Post-war World Organisation". The responses of the foreign participants of the commemoration show the image of Soviet science and some of its national features. One of them was called rootedness in popular culture, which reflected the scale of scientific achievements' popularization. The reverse side of popularization was the exaggeration of Russian scientists' achievements as a means of inflating national pride. Thus, one of the participants of the celebration, Sir Eric Ashby, captured the specifics of the opposition of Soviet science to the rest of the world - Soviet means excellent. This trend was clearly manifested somewhat later in other international and domestic political contexts.

ID SPAIN
AB For many years, Spain was one of a few European countries without an influential radical right party. In the recent years, the situation has changed sharply as a marginal right radical party VOX turned into a significant force - a third party in the Cortes according to the number of votes. The stormy take off of VOX cannot be separated from the systemic crisis of the Spanish polity which manifested itself particularly in the Catalan conflict. The threat to territorial integrity gave rise to a sense of impaired national dignity. Spanish nationalism, which seemed to recede into the background of the societal agenda during the first post-Francoist decades, has revived in a more radical guise. VOX advocates militant nationalism and upholds traditional values challenging the liberal paradigm of societal development. By sharply criticizing the liberal democratic regime VOX intends not to dismantle but to reform it. The revision assumes the reinforcement of centralizing and unitary origins in the Spanish state through the abolition of the autonomies' rights and also the radical restrictions of the rights of ethnic minorities (Catalans, Basques, immigrants). Such standpoint entails the strengthening of authoritarian tendencies in the mass consciousness. At the same time, the party does not stand against the democratic system and does not raise the question on the restoration of authoritarianism in Spain. VOX, therefore, discards some principles of liberal democracy (a number of elements of political pluralism), without rejecting the other (rights and freedoms for the majority of the population).

DE muslim community; Islam; France; "islamogoshism"; terrorism; public

AB The article considers the place of Muslims in the socio-political life of modern France. The heterogeneity of the Muslim community, different trends within it, the attitude of French Muslims to religion and its place in life are shown. It is noted that in recent years, French Muslims, especially young ones, have become more religious and more often observe the norms of the Koran. There is a growing number of Muslims who believe that the French secular state must adapt to Islamic norms of life. Against this background, especially in connection with the terrorist attacks that have not stopped since 2015, French society is growing distrust of Muslims. Most of the French perceive Islam as a "threat to the Republic". These sentiments are reflected in the socio-political discussion around issues related to immigration and the "Islamic factor", which involves well-known French intellectuals, writers and scientists. In the discussion, the supporters of "happy globalization", who believe that France will be saved by open borders (including President E. Macron and hisfollowers), are opposed by "declinists", who are afraid of "dissolving" France in the global world. Some advocate the recognition of communitarist movements, some defend the principles of French and/or Muslim identity, others defend multiculturalism, and yet others defend the Republican principles of "one nation" and the secular school. Recently, the discussion has included topics such as racism/anti-racism, the colonial past and anti-colonialism. The country approves a "cancel culture", which came from the United States and is new to France. An intolerant "cancel culture" contributes to radicalization of the discussion. Another new phenomenon is "anti-white racism" in the French university environment, evident in the fact that meetings are held in universities, attending which is prohibited for "whites". The peculiarity of the socio-political discussion today is that the number of its participants has increased dramatically. With the expansion of the circle of interested parties and the emergence of new platforms for discussion (social networks, messengers), it has acquired a new quality, and its tone is becoming more aggressive and irreconcilable.

AB In the course of the election campaign, a heated contest between President Donald Trump and Joe Biden revolved around the most acute problems of the United States. However, some foreign policy issues, primarily linked with Russia and China, occasionally emerged in their debates. The outcome of the presidential election of 2020 marked a watershed in the political fight for the White House between Republicans and Democrats, and it will have a tremendous impact on international affairs. The election campaign was unfolding amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Responding to the challenge has revealed a discord between the United States and the European Union on how to tackle the crisis and their opposite perceptions of the WHO's role. President-elect J. Biden is about to cancel D. Trump's dubious decisions on U.S. withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal, the Paris accord on climate, the World Health Organization. This reversal may lead to a more alignment between the United States and the European Union, but it can't prevent ongoing erosion of the U.S. global hegemony. Biden's election is in no way a guarantor for overcoming of transatlantic disagreements. American presidents come and go but diverging and conflicting interests of the United States and the EU remain.

   Interference in Agricultural Science in the Soviet Union

LA Russian
DT Article
DE agricultural science; agriculture; Communist Party of Soviet Union;
   research and production integration; USSR
AB Through the prism of the historical and anthropological approach, which presupposes the important role of ideological and worldview factors in the life of society, the article examines the reasons for party interference in agricultural scientific knowledge and analyzes its consequences. Initially, this interference was caused by the ideas existing in society about the relationship between biological and social processes, which led to the party structures' support of scientists who defended the decisive influence of the external environment on the formation of heredity of crops and animals. These ideas were considered as an additional justification for the possibility of social transformation on socialist grounds, provided that the social basis changes and the individualistic psychology in people's minds is overcome. However, the precedent of "ideological" interference in agricultural science served as the basis for further steps in this direction and on problems that did not have a political and ideological "sound". Party interference in the field of agricultural scientific knowledge manifested itself in the authorization of certain developments, in the initiation of "projects" that subsequently received "scientific" substantiation, in the bureaucratization of the implementation of the most important scientific and production programs, as happened with the program for the development of virgin and fallow lands. At the same time, the ideological factor gradually lost its significance, and a utilitarian approach was established in the party's attitude to agricultural science, the essence of which was as follows: the party will support the one who "promises" more. As a result of party interference in scientific knowledge, a stereotype of the behavior of scientists "dependent" on decisions "from above" was formed, which affected not only the agrarian science, but also other natural sciences. At the same time, an anti-scientific psychology was formed among production workers, who were forced not so much to follow scientific recommendations as to evade their implementation. As a result, the possibilities of scientific and technological progress were limited, production indicators in the agricultural sector worsened. Overcoming the mistakes made since the mid-1960s opened up opportunities for accelerating the integration of agricultural science and production. In the USSR, there appeared specific "oases" of agrarian well-being, with quite "harmonious" relations between agricultural science and production. However, the negative scenario of the country's development did not allow the positive trends that had been identified to be fully realized.

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

DT Article
DE economic diplomacy; National Security Strategy-2021; Putin and Biden;
   "Road Map"; Russia-USA
AB This article covers Russian-American relations during the presidency of Vladimir Putin and Joseph Biden. It seems that the worst ("bottom" and "freezing point") in the development of bilateral relations, as well as the "witch hunt" in the United States (unidentified hackers who allegedly committed cyber attacks on state's and party's structures), was left behind. However, numerous (energy, monetary, diplomatic, cultural, and civilizational) crises have re-emerged between Russia and the United States. Only economic diplomacy and the political will of those who determine and implement the state course can solve them. Economic diplomacy presents today a certain interest and a scientific problem at the same time. The lack of a strictly scientific interpretation of economic diplomacy and the difference in the perception of its essence are explained by the different approaches of scientists to the goal-setting in the study. The most advanced direction in the methodology of political sciences was the epistemological and systematic approach to the description of economic diplomacy. This is largely facilitated by the study of economic diplomacy on the example of modern Russia and the United States - two world powers as centers of strength and influence, indicators of international life, and some kind of dependent antipodes in balancing economic policies in favor of America. The undeniable facts of our time show that trade or commercial diplomacy is only one type of economic diplomacy, among others; that the diplomacy of the dollar as a world currency is rapidly losing its former position in the attempts of the United States to launch the electronic world economy; that political decision-making on economic diplomacy must necessarily be in the realm of its theory and practice, and not in the field of economic policy and political economy (as the influence of domestic and world business on the country's policy and its state course, as well as the politicization of international economic relations, respectively). International life, world order, geopolitics, and the world economy today are in the forming stage of a new system of international relations and other mechanisms of coordinated interaction between the countries of the world. The scientific hypothesis of the article is related to the statement that economic diplomacy is an alternative to the obsolete model of liberal capitalism (with its crises, sanctions, the excessively long stagnation of the world economy, the decline of national economies, regional conflicts, epidemics, the pandemic, and all the ensuing consequences) and that the parallel development of the Western and Eastern systems of international relations in the future is possible. The article provides a comparative analysis of certain aspects of the 2021 national security strategies of the Russian Federation and the USA. The concept of the modern theory of economic diplomacy on the basis of its systemic nature was outlined, which was the main research issue.

The professional brand-building foresight technology is a system of principles, methods and techniques for expert analysis of current achievements of students, young professionals and anyone who seeks self-improvement. Moreover, this training technology includes the development of programmes to optimise the professional and personal self-development of an individual in terms of his/her possible career growth.
   The aim of the current research was to justify the professional brand-building foresight technology developed by the authors, and to check the effectiveness of its application in the formation of brand-building and foresight competencies in a future specialist in the educational process of higher education.
   Methodology and research methods. The theoretical and methodological strategy in the study is a competency-based approach, which contributes to the formation of brand-building and foresight competencies. The conceptual provisions of the foresight approach, implemented in a complex of brand-forming tools of a single foresight trajectory in order to model and design a professional brand in relation to the strategic goals of a future specialist, became a practice-oriented research tactic. The authors used the following general scientific and specific scientific methods: questionnaire survey based on random systematic (mechanical) sampling, in-depth interview, expert survey, document analysis, self-assessment of readiness for personal brand-building.
   Results. The authors presented the professional brand-building foresight technology, the essence of which lies in the design of a professional brand and future career path. Its structure includes four programmes: self-marketing, personal branding, brand-building case and a road map to success. As a result of training, brand-building and foresight competencies are developed. The approbation experiment demonstrated that without special brand-building and foresight training of students, these competencies are formed spontaneously. Based on the results of the conducted surveys, the authors analysed the level of formation of brand-building and foresight competencies and the interest in the technology of personal brand-building as a factor of career self-development. A survey of university graduates revealed the dependence of employment on special teaching methods and the professional brand-building foresight technology. The interviews held with Russian and Latvian teachers determined the effectiveness of this technology. The study of the employers' opinions showed the reasons that hinder the successful employment of young specialists. In addition, the authors revealed a lack of knowledge and a non-systematic limited nature of teaching these competencies in universities.
   Scientific novelty lies in the replenishment of interdisciplinary (at the intersection of pedagogy, brand building, forecasting, professional studies) scientific knowledge about foresight methodology. The emphasis is on the innovativeness of the professional brand-building foresight technology, which contributes to the competitiveness of university graduates and increases their chances of professional success.
   Practical significance. The results of the research can be useful for developing ideas about brand-building and foresight competencies development, personal brand-building, professional brand-building foresighting. The research materials can be employed by students and teachers of higher education institutions, heads of educational systems in the organisation of the educational process, as well as by various specialists and practitioners.

DE Joe Biden; Donald Trump; USA; Middle East; American Arabs;
   Turkish-American community; Iran; Turkey; JCPOA; nuclear deal
AB In the early months of Joe Biden's administration in the White House, Middle East issues were not identified as a priority of its foreign policy. Individual steps in this direction, however, suggest that the administration will adhere to the principal lines of conduct for the United States towards American partners and allies (Israel, the Arab monarchies of the Gulf and others), as well as towards the main conflict nodes in the region (Syria, Libya, Yemen). At the same time, it is also obvious that its tactical emphasis has shifted in its approach to a number of the most important problems of the region - in particular, the Palestinian-Israeli standoff (namely, restoration of relations with the government of Mahmoud Abbas) and the situation around Iran (return to the renewed nuclear deal - JCPOA) and Turkey (overcoming the cooling of relations with Ankara). Apparently, we can talk about Biden's revival of the Middle East policy pursued under Barack Obama's administration. This process is largely due to the domestic political calculations of the Biden team and the Democratic Party as a whole. The author of the article tries to assess the influence of American immigrant's communities from the Arab countries and Turkey on Joe Biden's Middle East policy.

TI Politicization of COVID-19 health-protective behaviors in the United

AB During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. conservative politicians and the media downplayed the risk of both contracting COVID-19 and the effectiveness of recommended health behaviors. Health behavior theories suggest perceived vulnerability to a health threat and perceived effectiveness of recommended health-protective behaviors determine motivation to follow recommendations. Accordingly, we predicted that-as a result of politicization of the pandemic-politically conservative Americans would be less likely to enact recommended health-protective behaviors. In two longitudinal studies of U.S. residents, political conservatism was inversely associated with perceived health risk and adoption of health-protective behaviors over time. The effects of political orientation on health-protective behaviors were mediated by perceived risk of infection, perceived severity of infection, and perceived effectiveness of the health-protective behaviors. In a global cross-national analysis, effects were stronger in the U.S. (N = 10,923) than in an international sample (total N = 51,986), highlighting the increased and overt politicization of health behaviors in the U.S.

AB What have been the causes and consequences of technological evolution in world history? In particular, what propels innovation and diffusion of military technologies, details of which are comparatively well preserved and which are often seen as drivers of broad socio-cultural processes? Here we analyze the evolution of key military technologies in a sample of preindustrial societies world-wide covering almost 10,000 years of history using Seshat. Global History Databank. We empirically test previously speculative theories that proposed world population size, connectivity between geographical areas of innovation and adoption, and critical enabling technological advances, such as iron metallurgy and horse riding, as central drivers of military technological evolution. We find that all of these factors are strong predictors of change in military technology, whereas state-level factors such as polity population, territorial size, or governance sophistication play no major role. We discuss how our approach can be extended to explore technological change more generally, and how our results carry important ramifications for understanding major drivers of evolution of social complexity.

TI Appeals to Classic Literature in the Journalism of Vladimir Krutovsky as
   a Way of Broadcasting Sociopolitical Ideas
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Vladimir Krutovsky; M.E. Saltykov-Shchedrin; literary centrism;
   "Siberian Notes"; journal as means of consolidation
AB The aim of this article is to analyze the reception of works of metropolitan literature in the journalism of the Krasnoyarsk public figure Vladimir Krutovsky. The main material for the study was articles published in the journal Sibirskie Zapiski [Siberian Notes], which the "younger" regionalist Krutovsky founded in 1916, and which existed for about four years. The edition was conceived as a platform for uniting a part of the regionalism-minded Siberian intelligentsia. In this perspective, for Krutovsky, literature became a means of creating a "cultural field" beyond the Urals, and the publication of Sibirskie Zapiski in the period of sociocultural upheavals was actually equated with political action. The literary centrism of Krutovsky's consciousness was also manifested in the fact that references to the texts of classic Russian literature regularly appeared in his journalism. The main source of precedent texts was works by M.E. Saltykov-Shchedrin. In addition to them, the publicist regularly appealed to works by A.S. Pushkin, G.I. Uspensky, and contemporary authors. As a rule, such references were explicated and put in quotation marks. Often they were mediated by the journalism of N.M. Yadrintsev - an important symbolic figure for the "younger" regionalist Krutovsky. Krutovsky appealed to Saltykov-Shchedrin's texts mainly to criticize the actions of officials, as well as to express his own sociopolitical views. This method of reception was most clearly expressed in the post-revolutionary years, when Krutovsky criticized the initiatives of both the Bolshevik and Kolchak authorities. As can be seen from the articles of this period, the border between the contemporary reality and Saltykov-Shchedrin's texts was practically blurred in Krutovsky's mind, so his social criticism was saturated with appeals to the literary context. Krutovsky directly compared statesmen and officials with Saltykov-Shchedrin's negative characters - the inhabitants of Poshekhonye (Old Years in Poshekhonye), Glupov (The History of a Town), and the provincial Krutogorsk (Provincial Sketches). This method of polemic made it possible to give Krutovsky's theses greater credibility and emotional tension. The result of this method of writing was the "revival" of Saltykov-Shchedrin's characters, who literally penetrated into the reality. In addition, Krutovsky regularly identified the circumstances of his own life with episodes from Saltykov-Shchedrin's works. Such a combination made it possible to "enrich" the reality and increase the symbolic significance of the specific circumstances of his own social and political activities.

TI Coherence of Social Processes in Topics of Social Order and Disorder: To
   the Concept of Interstitial Emergence
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL

DT Article
DE social philosophy; theories of social sciences; coherence of social
   processes; social order; social disorder; interstitial emergence;
   Michael Mann
AB The author notes that a significant part of the theories of social philosophy that describes approaches to the coherence of social processes, implicitly substantiates structures that were formed in accordance with the idea of social order. T. Hobbes, M. Weber, T. Parsons, P. A. Sorokin, and some representatives of the theory of social synergetics are given as representatives of the theories of "social order". The author infers that a large number of theories and concepts in social philosophy are built around the definition of the conditions for the formation and stable existence of order and the description of its various forms. Much less attention is paid to various types of dysfunctionality, externality, and other unintended social consequences of order itself. In this regard, social disorder is taken beyond the limits of theoretical and methodological understanding. In order to expand the theoretical and methodological toolkits of social sciences, the author proposes to turn to the topic of social disorder. Although approaches that imply social disorder are not used as often as "ordering" approaches, the former should not be deprived of the attention of social philosophers, as they can enrich their understanding of the ways of forming social structures. As an approach that includes disorder in interpreting the coherence of social processes, the author gives a description of the theoretical and methodological framework and, in more detail, the phenomenon of interstitial emergence in Michael Mann's theory. His approach to the definition of the state and society, social processes, is considered. Mann's approach to power and its four types, which the theorist identifies as the main ones for analysis military, political, economic and ideological, are also described in detail. Mann interprets interstitial emergence as the emergence of competing configurations within the existing institutionalized networks of power. This emergence has a complex nature, it occurs at the intersection of different networks of power, it is difficult to predict or plan. The correlation of theories with the topics of social order and disorder, carried out in this article, allows concluding that interstitial emergence means a partial destruction or transformation of the first and the transition to the second. At the same time, the elevation of social disorder to the status of a social phenomenon allows Mann to fix the variety of manifestations of real life and at the same time makes his approach quite flexible, able to embrace a wide range of social phenomena and link social processes in a coherent scheme. The author concludes that, although Mann's approach is limited in its predictive capabilities due to the emphasis on randomness and involuntariness in the study of social processes, it has a heuristic potential for identifying factors, structure, directions, and patterns of their dynamics, and it is also capable of giving a rather sophisticated interpretation of the occurrences of coherence and incoherence in social processes.

AB The article was prepared within the project "post-crisis world order challenges and technologies, competition and cooperation" supported by the grant from ministry of science and higher education of the russian federation program for research projects in priority areas of scientific and technological development (agreement No 075-15-2020-783).
   The choice of the countries of Southeast Asia as an example for analyzing the nature of interaction between developing countries and China within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative is not accidental. The very logic of China's stated goals of gaining dominant positions in the world economy and politics makes it inevitable that the countries of Southeast Asia located in geographic proximity to it are included in its long-term economic and political plans. The question, however, is to what extent do they meet the interests of the Southeast Asian countries themselves? The solution to this question is the main subject of research in the article. There are objective prerequisites for mutually beneficial cooperation. The Belt and Road projects are viewed by China as a tool for economic expansion into the region with the prospect of taking a leading position there, using the interest of Southeast Asian countries in the inflow of foreign investment to create modern infrastructure, the lack of which narrows their opportunities for further economic growth, maintaining competitiveness and developing integration ties within ASEAN Community. Expert assessments made by international organizations confirm the positive impact of OBOR projects on the economic development of Southeast Asian countries and although today it is too early to draw any conclusions, since the initiative is only at the initial stage of its implementation in the region, nevertheless the case studies presented in the article indicate a mismatch in the positions of the parties on a number of issues related to the financing of projects, their lack of transparency. non-compliance with environmental and social requirements. The support of the initiative on the part of the Southeast Asian countries does not automatically mean their acceptance of the terms of the agreements proposed by China, which are far from always consistent with their national interests and give rise to fears in society about its expansionist intentions. Therefore, in many Southeast Asian countries, participation in OBOR projects is turning into a subject of political discourse, which reflects the presence of disagreements in society and confrontation of interests regarding the advisability of rapprochement with China, given the associated economic and political risks. The countries of Southeast Asia can be conditionally divided into two groups according to their relation to the Belt and Road initiative. The first group includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar, whose position can be described as national pragmatism. While supporting the Chinese initiative in general, they nevertheless assess the possible risks of their participation in projects and seek to reduce them. The second group is represented by Laos and Cambodia, whose leadership unconditionally supports the Chinese initiative, guided by the interests of their own survival, which largely depends on Chinese assistance. Therefore, the prospect of falling into a debt trap and increasing economic dependence on the PRC and even the threat of losing sovereignty does not deter them from participating in highly controversial projects from a commercial point of view. Based on the analysis made, the author comes to the conclusion that, given the existing alignment of political forces in Southeast Asia, China can count on promoting its initiative in the region, which, however, does not automatically lead to an increase in its political influence and to the creation of a China-centric model of regional order.

AB In 2020, the notion of "Islamist separatism," meaning the non-recognition of the fundamental principles of the French Republic by a part of the French population and expressed in the creation of a "parallel counter-society", was firmly entered into the French political lexicon. Despite the fact that the term "Islamist separatism" has drawn sharp criticism from a number of politicians and public figures as in France as abroad, it seems to us that this phenomenon really exists and not only challenges the secular foundations of the French state but also creates a quite tangible threat to security (I.e. in the form of terrorist activities). A number of terrorist acts carried out by militant Islamists in France look like a logical development of the "Islamist separatism" tendency. Moreover, not only France, but also a number of other European countries are faced with the phenomenon of "Islamist separatism", but namely France has a pronounced specificity in this context, associated with the emphatically secular nature of the state. In this regard, it is important to understand the reasons that contribute to the emergence of "Islamist separatism", which lie in various levels - from social and economic problems to socio-cultural and religious aspects. A separate problem is the potential for conflict, which contains "Islamist separatism" that threatens public peace and harmony and serves as a catalyst for the growth of nationalist and right-wing radical sentiments in French society. In this regard, it is important to use flexible and comprehensive measures to counter "Islamist separatism" (a combination of "hard power" and "soft power" instruments).

LA Russian
DT Book Review
DE power; behavioral economics; agency; private freedom; autocracy; market
   ethics
AB The review signifies the key ideas of the book by Shoshanna Zuboff, who indicates the rise of a new form of capitalism called surveillance capitalism. This economic order is dominated by commercial IT companies, with a power advantage anchored in the monopoly for the means of behavior modification. Algorithms track the personal experience of users, while the scientific processing of these data opens unprecedented opportunities for the prediction of human feelings, desires, and decisions that transform new digital certainty into an inexhaustible source of economic and political profit.
   Zuboff's research constructs a conceptual language for assessing the quality of a social order that is performatively produced by surveillance capitalism. The author criticizes the new economic system for breaking away from democratic principles. Control over human life, which can be achieved with modern information technology, is overarching. Recently, the massive expansion of consumer markets has fostered democratization and personalization. Surveillance capitalism involves objectifying a unique person to an anonymous Internet user and beginning to make money not out of consumer needs but by selling aggregated information about human behavior that can be used in consumer demand management. The fundamental message of the book is that European society is again risking its humanistic ideals for monetary gain. The book proves this message with the author's eight-year ethnography in the field of global technology corporations. Field results are assessed against the postulates of social behaviorism.
   The review reveals the experience of reading Sh. Zuboff's book in the context of the exploitation of man by man in modern European society. Researchers who compare different forms of capitalism with each other, think about the digitalization of the social order, or care about the challenges for human rights under different economic regimes will find the book thought-provoking and, therefore, useful.

One of the most pressing issues in the study of the role and place of transnational corporations in world politics is the problem of determining the status of transnational corporations in the global governance system. As a result, we find that transnational corporations act in the global governance system as tools and as institutions, which requires the development of new scientific approaches that reflect the dynamics of the introduction of these actors into the system of world politics.

AB The article is dedicated to the United States' achievements in space rivalry, its economic, geopolitical, scientific and technological aspects. Given the fact that the U.S. are faced with a difficult period in their history, they will try to restore the positive image of American democracy not only through traditional political methods, but also via scientific and technological leadership, including in the field of outer space exploration. The author focuses on NASA's modern space programs, among which am initiatives that deal with landing on asteroids, exploring deep space, the Moon and Mars as well as attempts to commercialize outer space through space tourism. The author also compares the space program budgets of the U.S., Russia, China and some European countries. The article presents all these aspects in the current context, with paying attention to the STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). The goal is to understand why America still leads in space exploration and sets the bar. In conclusion, the author argues that Washington will keep prioritizing space industry and involve private companies in this field through allocating additional funding and granting tenders to those who are most competitive. In addition, achievements in the U.S. space program is a matter of international prestige and American leadership, given the fact that the image of the country has suffered a lot, especially amidst Trump's bygone, yet controversial presidency. A successful implementation of Washington's ambitions in outer space will strengthen both its leadership and its ties with Europe, which is strategically important for America in the times of political confrontation with Russia and China. In the article, the author primarily relies on descriptive and narrative scientific approaches, comparative and historical methods as well as systematic approach by analyzing NASA documents and publications, speeches of the U.S. presidents and specialized media outlets. The novelty of the article adds up to the fundamental analysis of the American space program through the lens of history and current times while focusing on its political, economic and technological aspects.

   apparatus; struggle; sovereignty; devaluation of power
AB In historical Caucasian studies in recent decades, many "copies" have been broken in discussions on the political role of Kabarda in the North Caucasus region in the XVI - early XIX centuries. The key figure in the system of the power hierarchy of the Kabardian principality was the supreme/ senior prince. An analysis of the change in the status of the senior prince of Kabarda allows us to give an answer about the reasons for the weakening of the principality, the loss of sovereignty and entry into the Russian Empire.
   After the death of the legendary prince Inal, the early feudal state of Circassia created by him disintegrated into many possessions. One of the most powerful was Kabarda, divided into four lands. The consolidating figure in the principality was the supreme prince of all Kabarda - pshishkho/oliypsh, elected at the congresses of "all the land" in turn from each inheritance, but his functions were significantly limited by the sovereign appanage princes. In the public consciousness and practical activities of the descendants of Inal, a view was established that did not allow the rise of some princes over others.
   The seizure of power by the descendants of Psheapshoka Kaitukin (late XVI - early XVII century) led to their usurpation of the right to elect "grand princes" only from representatives of their clan. The split of the political elite of Kabarda in the 20s of the XVIII century into the Baksan and Kashkatau parties, oriented towards the Crimean Khanate and the Russian Empire, strengthened centrifugal tendencies, weakened its military potential, and led to the maximum weakening of the power of the supreme prince. This led to the intensification of internecine clashes, led to the military and political weakening of all institutions of power, and in 1822 the Russian administrative and judicial system was finally established in Kabarda.

AB The article deals with the role that the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) played in the implementation of the Russian strategies at the late 19th - early 20th centuries. Based on published and archival materials it provides a glimpse of the aspects of Russia's foreign policy as well as conditions and factors affecting the construction and operation of the railway. It gives attention to the relations of Russia with the countries competing for spheres of influence in China and Korea and provides an assessment of material resources involved in the construction and maintenance of the railway as well as that of its freight operations. The analysis of the impact that the railway had on the colonization of the territory and the development of the productive base and trade in Manchuria is proposed. The public attitude of Russia towards the situation in the CER zone is shown. Conclusions concerning the appropriateness of the construction of the railway on the territory of Northeast China and its consequences are drawn. It is noted that the expectations for the CER as a tool of political and economic expansion of Russia had but a non-lasting effect and eventually failed. Russia's trade and productive capacity against the leading and growing economic and financial systems of other countries lagged behind in terms of dynamics and scale. As a result of the short-sighted policies pursued by the government and erroneous prioritizations, the Russian Far East lost viable opportunities to develop available resources and achieve socio-economic growth. Losses that Russian suffered in the East in the early 20th century made the tsarist government to adopt more considered strategies in the region.

AB The article describes the transformation of the political regime of the Third Ukrainian Republic. The author holds that this big European country deserves attention not only as part of its recent history and that of Europe, but also as a manifestation of some European and global political processes. Using the methods of historical analysis and periodization, an attempt is made to place the last 30 years of the Ukrainian Republic in the general context of the recent history of Ukraine, to identify the reasons for the incomplete "Ukrainian project", the difficulties of its external perception and international positioning. The scientific novelty of the proposed analysis is that the political regimes that have existed in the Ukrainian Republic since its proclamation are considered as interrelated in the process of its evolution, and the latest of them - in the light of the hypothesis of two transformations - as its last phase. The main conclusion is that Ukraine's difficult path of political self-identification is not complete and it faces necessity to find a new internal and external political paradigm and another reboot of the political regime.

AB COVID-19 pandemic started one century after Spanish flu epidemic that killed about 40 million people. It ended as unexpectedly as it began, and was followed by the Paris Conference of 1919, which gave start to the Versailles system, planned as a new system of eternal peace, but collapsed 20 years later. The same happened with the Yalta system at the end of XX centure. Today, the configuration of the world is in the process of changes. The USSR disappeared from the political map of the world, and new world centers appeared with different views on global politics. The interests of the United States, Russia, China, and EU-27 do not coincide, and often contradict each other. Today, with a certain degree of probability, one can speak of the formation of a "new bipolarity", where the United States? NATO and the EU enter into an economic, political and potentially a military confrontation with China and Russia. The future of this system will largely depend on both the outcome of economic competition between the West and China and the level of development of relations between China and Russia. The current pandemic, let's hope, will also end someday, and humanity will be able to create a system of bipolar or multipolar interstate relations that will reliably protect the world from epidemics and wars. This article examines the prospects for the formation of a multipolar world and the future role of Russia.

AB High-tech innovation is often understood as creating new worlds and trajectories of development and generating uncertainty. On the basis of 15 interviews with the heads of Russian medical technology companies, the paper presents the different types of uncertainties faced by med-tech entrepreneurs. Is the lack of exact knowledge about the results of the development and implementation of new technologies (a classic type of uncertainty in the innovation sector) perceived by entrepreneurs as a difficulty? Or do they deal with uncertainties of another type, for example, related to the political and economic context in the country? What business models are emerging in the industry for regional companies? What is the role of expectations and the imagination in the work of the company director or R & D engineers? How is this related to the specifics of the health industry?
   As a theoretical basis, the concepts of uncertainty in the innovation sector, as well as uncertainty associated with the rules of the game set by political and economic institutions, are considered. The strategies of innovative entrepreneurs in conditions of uncertainty are investigated using the concept of the imaginary in the version of science and technology studies (STS). This research identifies four business models of hi-tech entrepreneurs in Russia: Small deal supporters, Revolutionaries, Conformists, and Isolationists. In the development of medical equipment, it is important that the main customers of medical devices in Russia are state-owned hospitals. One of the most winning strategies for Russian entrepreneurs is the use of ambiguity, i.e., to second-guess the agenda set by government agencies and use official rhetoric in negotiations with officials. One might have expected that, especially in such a situation, imaginaries might be a vehicle for innovation. However, uncertainty about rules and ambiguity in political priorities results in an imaginary drama-imaginaries in med-tech companies do not exist, and neither does innovation.

AB The article mainly concentrates on the state religious policy during the final period of the Empress Elizaveta Petrovna's reign. The role of the Board of Foreign Affairs in the solution of the conflict between Austrian Capuchin missionaries and Armenian Gregorian community in the towns in the south of the Russian Empire, complicated by the intervention of the Austrian Ambassador N. Esterhazy, is studied for the first time in historiography. The proposed research bases on little-known materials of the collegiate investigation of the conflict. Taking into account the information extracted from sources, the article reconstructs the conflict situation and traces the political and diplomatic communication, in which the Foreign Board was the organizer and the most important actor. Most attention is paid to the characteristics of the interaction of the collegium with other actors, and communicative features are revealed in each specific case. It is shown the inclusion in the communicative toolkit of language and concepts that reflect the trend of religious tolerance in Russian domestic politics. The author states in conclusion the flexibility and variability of communication built by the diplomatic department at different levels, the reflection in it of the ethnoreligious processes inherent in the development of the Russian outlying territories of the early modern period, the mastering of the discourse of religious tolerance by Russian diplomacy on the eve of the aggravation of the "dissident issue" in Rzeczpospolita Polska (the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth).

AB Experiments of various kinds are increasingly being used in the social sciences to derive causal inference. Among the varieties of this method, field experiments are especially noteworthy. Explosive growth in their numbers has been observed in recent years, primarily in economics and political science. Gradually, field experimentation is starting to spread to other disciplines. One of the most important reasons for this is the popularization of the so-called Donald Rubin model of causal inference, which allows researchers to link experimental methods with statistics and other mathematical methods. In the Russian-speaking academic field, one can observe a lack of texts describing how field experiments are related to this model in causal inference, while such a research design allows us to focus specifically on the search for the causality of various social phenomena. This article provides a critical-bibliographic review of both the conceptual model of causation and the existing research carried out in the design of field experiments in the Rubin model. The first part of the paper provides a brief overview of the main paradigms of causation and how, from one of them (the approach of potential outcomes and counterfactual inference), the Rubin model logically arises. The following describes the milestones in the history of field experiments before the Rubin model. This is followed by a description of the model and today's debate about the advantages, limitations, and design features of the field experiment. Finally, with a few examples, we analyze several well-known field experiments to illustrate the operation of the described method.

AB This article opens a series of research papers dedicated to the former Foreign Minister of the USSR Andrei Gromyko. His contribution to the development and implementation of the security policy is highlighted. The detente policy is understood as part of the security policy. The first article defines the security policy. The most important stages of A. Gromyko diplomatic career are highlighted. Problems of foreign policy continuity, the role that the personal factor plays, and the relationship between strategy and tactics are particularly important in the research the security policy. A distinction must be made between strategy and tactics in politics and diplomacy. This has an essential practical meaning because a correct balance of tactical and strategic approaches is a prerequisite for the success of the security system, which can be built within the framework of a certain paradigm. The author argues that the descriptive story (Part 4 of the article) is one of the possible variants of historiography explaining the role of the personal factor. Much more important, however, is to supplement traditional history with research, because this can lead to the "Gromyko rules" (Part 3 of the article). This helps to better articulate the lessons of history. The article contributes to the author's earlier works on the role of A. Gromyko and his diplomatic school.

AB In the article, on the basis of the comprehensive use of the literature and sources at our disposal, a systematic study of the history of the construction and functioning of the fortifications of the Left Wing of the Caucasian Cordon Line in the context of the military-political subordination of the region is carried out. Having carried out an analytical analysis of the complex of sources, literature, and historical concepts at the research disposal, we made an attempt to systematically study the influence of cordon fortifications and fortresses in the Eastern Caucasus on the military-political subordination of the region during the Caucasian War. In addition, we are making an attempt to classify the methods of military and political subordination. The study attempts to reveal the role and significance of the fortifications of the Left Wing of the Caucasian Cordon Line in the subordination of the territory of the Eastern Caucasus to the Russian Empire in the 19th century, as well as to show the evolution of the regional management system during the Caucasian War. The topic of the history of the creation of cordon lines in the Eastern Caucasus, the goals and objectives of their construction is poorly covered in the scientific literature. To achieve the designated research goals and objectives, the use of the value approach was of great importance. This approach allowed not only to develop a certain attitude and assess the processes under study, but also contributed to the franking of historical events, using such scientific categories as "place", "role", "meaning", "experience". Cordon fortifications and fortresses were the conductors of the Caucasian policy in the Russian Empire in the Eastern Caucasus. Until the 30s of the XIX century, the tsarist administration of the Russian Empire mainly used the tactics of military conquest of territories by means of punitive operations to subjugate the territories of the Eastern Caucasus. The harsh methods of military subordination were gradually replaced by methods of political control, the dissemination of Russian legislation and orders. It is worth talking about political development only in those territories that were initially subordinated by force of arms, and only after a lapse of time, by means of acculturation, everyday communication and trade and economic contacts, did they become mentally closer to Russia. On the border territories, to the cordon Lines, colonization was actively carried out, first military, then civil, which also contributed to the military-political subordination of the region. The personal factor was of great importance in matters of military-political subordination of the Eastern Caucasus, the managers changed, transformed the internal vector of the Caucasian policy, changing it depending on their ideas about the conquest of the region. During the 19th century, the tactics of military subordination of the region began to evolve and transform into the military-political development of the region, with the predominant use of military resources, which was due to the ongoing Caucasian war.

TI GERMANY AND THE EUROPEAN UNION AFTER THE EPOCH OF CHANCELLOR ANGELA

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Merkel; Germany; European Union; NATO; European integration; European
   sovereignty; European army; pandemic; Russia; relations between RF; FRG
   and the EU; Ukrainian conflict
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the political legacy of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and in what way the new German government might possibly use it dealing with the transformation of the country and modernization of the European Union. The new political coalition with possible participation of the Green Party will preserve the continuity of the German foreign policy course for strengthening the European Union, deepening the transatlantic partnership, for active cooperation between Berlin and Paris, as well as for inclusion of Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine into the Euro-Atlantic area. The European sovereignty is the main focal point in Berlin. The Conference on the Future of Europe examines it, as well as other evolution issues. The updated legal framework of the EU, feasible strengthening of the European Parliament positions could help transform the European Union into a weighty actor in the polycentric world. Only powerful, relatively sovereign EU is able to secure the "European way of life". Judgments about the disintegration of the European Union are far from reality. The EU margin of safety and resistance are quite impressive, primarily due to the economic potential of Germany. However, it is really difficult to predict how the European Union will get out of the crisis caused by Covid-19. American concessions to the Germans on the Nord Stream 2 project mean Bidet's serious attitude towards Merkel and Germany - the leader in the EU and one of the important NATO allies. The conditions for Russia's return to the "European club", for example, through the revival of M. Gorbachev's new political thinking in Moscow, indicate rather an illusory desire. There is another, more pragmatic approach. The single European cultural and historical matrix of Greater Europe, communication between the leaders of the Russian Federation, Germany, France and the USA, the economic foundation of contacts, as well as mutual sympathies between Russians, Germans, Europeans give reason to hope for a turn for the better. The chances of a unification agenda remain. Perhaps, it will be used by future generations of politicians, experts of the Russian Federation and the Federal Republic of Germany without preconditions, on the basis of reasonable compromises.

AB This paper reviews the theoretical and research literature on venture capitalism. The major approaches to the study of venture financing and its institutional forms are considered against the background of the experience of the U.S., where this industry exists the longest. Economists analyze venture capital as an institutional response either to the failure of the market for knowledge or to the failure of the market for entrepreneurial finance. Economic sociologists complement this analysis by emphasizing venture capital firms' role in socializing technological entrepreneurs, indirect financing of innovation ecosystems, and risk management. In the more recent literature inspired by critical political economy and economic history, this functionalist, market-failure type of argument is increasingly called into question because of its insufficient attention to the role of the state in creating and maintaining the venture capital industry. Based on this literature, the paper illustrates the connection between the genesis of the venture capital industry in the U.S. and the evolution of the developmental state in post-war U.S. In conclusion, this paper discusses institutional alternatives to venture capital and the applicability of the U.S. experience to other contexts.

AB The study intends to develop an empirical vector model of Russia's foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific region. In order to achieve this goal, based on the Foreign Policy Principles of the Russian Federation for 2000-2016, the vectors of Russia's foreign policy were determined, and the place of the Asia-Pacific region in Russia's foreign policy was outlined. Using data from the World Bank's World Integrated Trade Solution, Russia's key economic partners in the Asia-Pacific region were identified. Information on GDP growth rates and inflation index trends shows that such partners are Bangladesh, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia. The authors developed the vector model of Russia's foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on economic cooperation with the above-mentioned key partner countries. The proposed foreign policy vector model will contribute to Russia's increased economic and political presence in the Asia-Pacific region, which is in line with Russia's foreign policy goals in this region and will also have a positive effect on the development of the Russian economy, particularly in the Far East. The limitation is that the proposed vector of Russia's foreign policy development can be implemented in the absence of additional international sanctions, which might target companies from the Asia-Pacific region.

AB Why do state capitalist regimes, while aiming to increase control over the economy, introduce partial privatization and liberalization at their national oil companies (NOCs)? The article presents a case study and discourse analysis of liberalizing reforms to the management of "Health, Safety, and Environment" at the Russian and Brazilian NOCs. Employing a constructivist political economy approach emphasizing the co-constitution of state power and market power, it argues that adopting the practices of effective oil multinationals allows NOCs to represent themselves as capitalist corporations - not state bureaucracies - and thereby better fulfill their coordinating function in state-permeated market economies.

   state from the 17th to 19th centuries
SO RUDN JOURNAL OF RUSSIAN HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian state; Yakut elite; citizenship; incorporation; management
AB The article discusses the incorporation of the elite of the Yakut uluses - traditional potestary institutions - into the Russian state through its communicative space. At the same time, a new interpretation of uluses is given as a special political form of organization of nomadic peoples. In view of their dispersed and mobile lifestyle, communication played an important role among them. With titles such as toyons, kniastsy, and "best people", the taxonomy of the representatives of the Yakut elite finds analogies among other nomadic peoples. The article discusses the genealogical principle of the legitimacy of power and the governance practice of the Russian state in Yakutia. This article breaks new ground by analyzing the routes and forms of political communication through which the influence of the Russian state on the ulus system in general and on the ulus elite in particular was carried out. The activities of the provincial administration in relation to toyons to make them Russian subjects are interpreted as a route for the formation of the communication space in the imperial outskirts. The delegations of the Yakut nobles to the Russian tsars of the 17th and 18th centuries, and the inclusion of Yakut elite representatives into the Russian nobility, expanded this space by increasing the Yakuts' confidence in the ruling regime. The article also takes account of local features of this process, which influenced the rate and nature of incorporation. The paper characterizes the communicative practices of embedding the Yakut ulus elite into the district governance system of Yakutia. The author argues that typologically, the ideas of citizenship adopted in the Russian state and in the Yakut ulus elite coincided. The Yakut nobles, apparently, did not differ in this from the related Turkic-Mongol elites of Southern and Western Siberia, but differed, in turn, in the pace of transition to tsarist power, since the former had an alternative in the face of politically strong neighbors, for example, Dzungaria.

AB The advancement and promoting by the United States of its concept of Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) has shaped many of political discussions in Asian countries in recent years. The Republic of Korea is no exception. From this perspective, the article reviews the basic aspects of the evolution of South Korea's foreign policy course as well as new priorities in that area which have been forged with the advent of President Moon Jae-in administration. The paper shows that the complex fluctuations of the South Korea's external policy have been defined by the need to maintain the focus on the United States, on one side, and desire to nurture strategic partnership with China, on the other side. However, finding the right balance in that political equation has been significantly complicated due to the growing confrontation between the two global powers. Special attention is given to the role and place of South Korea in the U.S. Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy. The article examines the main directions, some of the outcomes and the prospects of cooperation between Washington and Seoul aimed at harmonizing their regional strategies in view of the factors facilitating those interactions as well as those hampering them. President Trump highlighted that the United States - the Republic of Korea alliance remains a linchpin for security, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. However, the dialogue between the two partners has not revealed the willingness of South Korea to collaborate with the United States on that theme beyond a narrow framework of purely economic coordination. Particularly, South Korea has consistently rejected the attempts of its ally to involve the country into the activities of Quad for fear of a possible adverse effect for the Korea-China relationships. All of those questions are examined in the article in linkage with a number of bilateral problems prevailing in the ROK-USA alliance which have complicated the collaboration between the two countries on regional issues in recent times.

AB The article explores new policies related to security and economic development as represented by the cases of the Republic of Korea and Japan. It assesses combination of old and new internal and external challenges to security, economic development, and social stability, noting the increased interplay of factors affecting national security and innovative growth. The latter is increasingly viewed as an indispensable condition for military, political and social security of a nation, for effectively responding to external pressures as well as to ecological, epidemiological and technology-related risks. Rising technological capabilities in the two Northeast Asian nations contribute to their international ambitions. The authors analyze the tendency in the Republic of Korea to pursue a more independent foreign policy as a "middle power", and Japan's growing international and military profile in the Asia Pacific. The risks and possible future consequences of this trend are explored and assessed. The authors identify the priorities of the Republic of Korea's development strategy within the framework of the "Korean New Deal", and a new vision of the future of Japan as presented in the strategic documents of its government. They note greater aspirations of the two nations to increase their competitive edge in the regional and global race to reach and retain leading positions in the international hierarchy of economic and political power. New tools to ensure this edge are being tested by South Korean and Japanese governments, as old instruments of industrial policy seem to be losing strength and produce little effect.

TI Market Trade as a Stage of the Far Eastern Citizens' Life Trajectory
   (The 1990s)
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Russian Far East; market trade; open markets; "chelnoki"; everyday life
AB On the basis of biographical sources, the article shows the experience of ordinary trade participants' work at "open markets" in the long historical retrospective (about 10 years). Differences in the perception of the new lifestyle and social status at the time of the events (by letters) and post factum (in memories) are analyzed. The article used the previously unknown complex of documents from the author's personal archive - the correspondence of a Far Eastern family for 1991-1999 (81 letters), as well as memoirs about the 1990s (74 essays) recorded in 2013-2014 and stored in the Archive of the Department of Socio-Political Research of the Institute of History, Archaeology and Ethnography of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The focus is on the ways of rationalizing the people's choice to trade, and on the identification of the stages of involvement in trading practices, the range of changes in forms of activity within the market format, and results in solving everyday problems by trading. There are several stages in the trajectory of "entering" the market: "speculation" with scarce goods obtained with ration stamps and clothes coupons (moreover, this illegal Soviet practice is becoming a wide-spread phenomenon and a norm, especially among pensioners); market trade as secondary employment; market trading as the main activity; job search by specialty and "exit" from trade. Each "entry" stage could take about a year; when trade was the main activity (about five years), people could move from one market sector to another in search of more income and more comfortable working conditions. Going beyond the market format was hampered by the filter bubble and the general lack of good jobs in the 1990s. The comparison of sources that emerged directly in the 1990s and those recorded later shows that the actual perception of market trading and the historical memory of it are different. In a crisis, the fact of survival (and necessity entrepreneurs) was perceived as an unconditional benefit. With the crisis behind, the survival situation (and trade) is remembered as a humiliating and unnecessary experience outside the normal biographical trajectory. On the whole, in the conditions of the transformational crisis, the Far East citizens showed the ability for pre-adaptation - readiness for new forms of activity without preparation in the previous experience of the Soviet person, and "open markets" acted as the initial centers of social homeostasis - relatively isolated communities trying to survive in an aggressive and dynamically changing economic space.

DT Article

   diplomacy; sport
AB This article aims to analyze Russia and its Central Asian partners' participation in the multilateral cooperation in sport in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The research is a part of an integrated study of the humanitarian cooperation between Russia and post-Soviet Central Asian countries: the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Tajikistan, the Republic of Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. In the CIS legislative and political practice, humanitarian cooperation, or people-topeople exchanges, includes partnership in such areas as culture, science, education, sport, tourism, youth policy, and media. Sport is an essential component of this cooperation, and the states pay more and more attention to interaction in this area. The cooperation is carried out at bilateral and multilateral levels. The latter is provided by the CIS. We consider the bilateral ties between Russia and each of post-Soviet Central Asian countries in a separate research, while this research covers the CIS format. We consequently study the institutions, the legal basis, the formats, and the practical implementation of cooperation throughout the recent decade, before the pandemic. The aim of the research is to define the structure of CIS formats for cooperation in sport, and how Russia and its Central Asian partners are involved in it. We have studied such sources as multilateral diplomatic documents, reports, plans, and other documents of the CIS institutions, and relevant online news archives of mass media. The article concludes that the CIS, as an intergovernmental organization, has formed a diverse structure of cooperation in sport, including a specialized institution (the CIS Council on Physical Education and Sport), a detailed legal basis and a large number of formats for multilateral exchanges: not only tournaments, but consultations, conferences, and legal ties as well. The study demonstrates the comprehensive approach of the organization towards multilateral ties in this area. Russia is not only presented in all cooperation formats, but actually is the organizer and the initiator of the majority of them. The representation and the involvement of Central Asian countries in the related CIS institutions, documents and formats of cooperation varies considerably. Among them, during the last decade, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan demonstrated the most active participation, while Turkmenistan has rejected the majority of formats, and sent its teams to a selected number of tournaments. Uzbekistan has also dismissed some formats, but gradually its participation has started to increase. The lesser number of events, organized by Central Asian countries, can be explained by the lesser national budgets; however, the reasons for dismissing the multilateral institutions are far more likely of a political character, namely the political priorities of closeness and neutrality.

AB Modern Russian science pays considerable attention to the study of the Revolution and the Civil War, as well as the life of the Army in that period, from the standpoint of personal social history and military anthropology. Researchers today are increasingly turning to the problem of the "little man" - an ordinary participant in those events. The aim of this publication is to reconstruct the biography of Mikhail Aleksandrovich Butrimovich (1880- [19331), which is indicative of the period, in a problematic vision at the intersection of military history and military anthropology. The reconstruction is based on historical sources the author of the article identified. The analysis of Butrimovich's fate reveals the situation of "former people" in the RSFSR-USSR. Such people included representatives of the command and administrative staff of the Old and White Armies. To achieve the aim of the study, it is necessary to solve the following problems: (1) to describe the tactics and methods of social adaptation of former military officials as part of the Army to the cataclysms in the Russian state and society in the period from 1917 till the 1930s; (2) to assess Butrimovich's behavior in this period; (3) to determine the scientific aspects that an anthropological study of the situation of former army officers and officers during the Civil War and pre-war Soviet society gives access to. The basis for the preparation of the study was a set of unpublished sources from the funds of the Historical Archive of Omsk Oblast and the Archive of the Office of the FSB of Russia in Bryansk Oblast. These are Butrimovich's biographical documents; materials on Butrimovich's being on military and special records in the bodies of the Cheka-OGPU, depriving him of suffrage and restoring his voting rights; materials of the archival criminal case by the OGPU bodies on Butrimovich's political prosecution. The connection between the general historiography of the topic and the issue under study is given. The anthropological approach and the biographical method, based on the genre of the publication, formed the theoretical basis of the study. Particular attention in the publication is paid to the study of Butrimovich's professional activities. The biography presented to the reader is an example of success in a number of aspects of social adaptation to the conditions of the military revolutionary period of 1917-1920 and its consequences in Soviet Russia. According to the results of the study, the author states that, in relation to the considered case, the anthropological vision of the past focuses on understanding the history of mentality, military and political everyday life of the first third of the twentieth century. The work is addressed to a wide range of readers, including specialists who study military history, military anthropology, the Civil War in Russia, Soviet society, and Soviet repressive politics in the pre-war period.

DT Article

AB The article is focused on the evolution of the approaches of the Communist Party of China's leadership to the Soviet model; it analyzes changing accents in its understanding that dominated in different periods, and the normative conclusions made from critical understanding of the Soviet experience. In 1956, Mao Zedong called to "take the USSR as a mirror" and underscored the importance of national specifics in modernization process. Since the late 1970s, Deng Xiaoping considered the Soviet model completely outdated and ineligible to any improvement, his reforms policy excluded any possibility of China's return to the Soviet patterns. He solved the task of taking lesson from the "Soviet warning" in economy by abandoning high centralization and rigid planning. Since the 1990s, the themes of stability of party power, amassing public support, and ability of the ruling party to respond decisively to serious crises, occupied an increasingly prominent place in the Chinese debates on the Soviet lessons. Under Xi Jinping, the attention focused on the influences of the loss of political convictions by the party members and of the spread of "historical nihilism" on the collapse of the USSR and the downfall of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The focus in rethinking of the Soviet model shifted to the spheres of control over administrative power, institutionalization of rights, fight against corruption, modernization of the governance system. The chain of continuity of China's development course is built around the theses about the priority of national specifics and a critical attitude towards foreign experience. It is concluded that during the period of reforms, the development of market economy in China went far beyond the original framework of Soviet centralized planned economy. In the political sphere, Soviet lessons keep their relevance and serve as a justification for the course of strengthening the ideological cohesion of the ruling party.

AB The paper deals with the sovereign wealth funds' (SWFs) reactions to the economic and geo-political turbulence of 2020 emerged from COVID-19 pandemic. In recent decade, SWFs as state-run investment vehicles have proved to be the fastest growing group of institutional investors and have noticeably strengthened their role in the global financial system. According to the latest estimates, their cumulative AUM reached 9.1 billion US dollars as of December 2020. There are persuasive evidences that top-10 SWFs from Norway, China, Singapore, Persian Gulf and some other nations have evolved into full-fledged market-driven investors with an active portfolio management strategy. The fact that they continue to contribute the lion's share (around 2/3) into the integral figures of SWFs' performance as a group explains why the pandemic failed to undermine their progress. Also, it should be taken in mind that, in contrast to GFC of 2008-2009, the recent coronacrisis was featured by a seemingly surprising gap between the deep recession in real sector businesses and eventual growth of basic indexes of capital markets. Generally, this turned good for the financial market community, including many SWFs. For instance, the world's largest Norwegian GPFG, despite an urgent sellout of some of its assets in order to help the national government in financing somewhat undermined state budget in the situation of deep slump at world oil market, reported, by the end of the year, the 10.9% operational profit and 8.2% increment of AUM (in terms of local currency). In the upcoming years, we may see the state funds vehicles to increasing change the whole landscape of the global investment playfield. It is highly likely that the post-COVID turbulent environment will increasingly push the SWFs not only to seek for viable alternatives to the increasingly fading traditional fixed-income instruments but to fundamentally change the mandates and the modes of operation. The traditional stabilization and saving state investment funds will step down in favor of a subgroup of the so called strategic SWFs, such as Singaporean Temasek, Chinese CIC, Saudi PIF, Indian NIIF, Malaysian Khazanah, Turkish TVF, Bahraini Mubadala, and Russian RDIF. Basically, they are charged to operate as the catalysts of national economic and social development. It may be expected that in the near future this category of state investors will see a growing number of newcomers.

AB American society has always been characterized by heterogeneity and lack of internal unity. This was determined by the very process of the emergence, formation, and evolution of the American nation, in which all ethnic groups and races existing on the globe are represented. Dividing lines and associated group, ethnic, racial, social, and political conflicts, potentially able to cause internal division, have accompanied Americans throughout their history. However, being a classical society of group interests, American society has developed a mechanism for reconciling and regulating such contradictions. Democracy has become such a mechanism, aimed at finding an acceptable compromise between interested groups. From time to time, the lines of potential split made themselves felt. The modern era in this regard is no exception for the United States. Over the past three decades, a large-scale internal political crisis has been developing in that country. It is indicated by the deep polarization of society, accompanied by a sharp interparty split and intraparty riots. The Democratic and Republican parties, around which the political space in the United States was organized for decades, have found themselves in a crisis, which spreads to both the electorate and the party elite.

AB Introduction. This article examines the modern educational approach in the field of liberal arts and practical finance, democratisation of the decision-making system in educational institutions through the active engagement of students on the example of US schools and universities. This approach is based on initiative, or participatory budgeting, i.e. students are involved in the process of allocation of budgetary funds of schools and universities. Such participatory practice has educational and administrative objectives, as it serves to improve the quality management in educational institutions through the involvement of students in major decisions. Taking into account the fact that students are the key beneficiaries of the education system, their opinions lead to increased efficiency in educational institutions.
   Aim. On the basis of real cases, the current research is aimed to identify and describe participatory techniques that can integrate the teaching of theoretical knowledge in the field of civil society with the formation of practical skills in this area.
   Methodology and research methods. Desk research method of analysing primary and secondary sources (websites of educational institutions, academic publications, and articles in the media) and the field sociological method of expert interviews were used. Expert interviews with representatives of schools and universities, teachers, officers from educational institutions, consultants from the Participatory Budgeting Project, the leading consulting organisation in North America were conducted.
   Results. The results of the study reveal several participatory techniques for students' engagement in the allocation of budgetary funds of schools and universities that are applied in New York and Arizona. The identified and described technologies of participation contribute to the formation of students' knowledge of socio-economic disciplines, practical finance and civics, project management skills, as well as an increase in civic engagement.
   Scientific novelty. The present study expands the ideas about how to improve the process of teaching social and economic disciplines at schools and universities, practical finance and project management. The method of improving the efficiency of educational institutions through democratic practices is identified.
   Practical significance. In the future, the proposed approach can be applied in Russian educational institutions.

AB Following the events of 1991, Russia established either bilateral or multilateral relations with most of the independent states that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union. In each individual case, these relations were characterized by a specific set of advantages and disadvantages. The article explores the evolution of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) through the lens of this fundamental duality. This overview in no way claims to be a complete or exhaustive study on the subject. However, its relevance is supported by the fact it moves beyond the purely descriptive approach which still dominates the study of the CSTO and the crisis that has gripped the organization. There is a demand for a clearer structural and theoretical framework explaining the difficulties Russia has faced in promoting its integration efforts in the post-Soviet space. The undeniable advantage of the bilateral approach is its institutional simplicity. In a multilateral system or a block of states, it is far more difficult to coordinate the interests of every individual nation, especially if they maintain membership in a number of integration groups at the global or regional level. One of the strengths of the multilateral format, which involves a stricter adherence to collective obligations, is that it serves as a structural framework for major integration projects that can have a significant positive effect on the international standing of those who initiate them. The author concludes that in 2002-2008, during the early period of CSTO's existence, cooperation was predominantly multilateral in nature, with the participating countries - those representing the Central Asian core of the organization - rallying around Moscow, unified by the commonly perceived threats generated by the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan. However, even at this early stage, there were signs within the CSTO foreshadowing a shift from multilateral military-political cooperation to a more basic format - that of a collection of bilateral ties between Russia and its allies. The past 20 years of Russia's relations with its neighbors have demonstrated that the historical momentum for convergence is, in fact, not strong enough to offset the centrifugal forces pulling nations away from one another.

AB Protests in today's Russia are still influenced by trends emerged in the 2000s. According to Graeme B. Robertson, in the second half of the 2000s, the repertoire of the Russian protest changed and direct actions were replaced by symbolic actions. The article argues that protest trends and changes in the repertoire of actions were accompanied by the formation of widespread political perceptions among protesters. These perceptions reflected and influenced transformations of Russian protest movements. The article analyzes political discourses of three lifestyle media outlets, namely Afisha, Bol'shoi Gorod, Esquire, Gq and Epic Hero. All of them drew attention to protests and elaborated their own vision of preferable protest methods. This vision denounced direct actions and advocated constructive and non-antagonistic relations between protesters and the authorities.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE competition; post-Soviet space; Central Asia; Russia; security;
   alternatives; multi-vector policy
AB The article analyzes the innovations that determine the main directions and specific characteristics of international political competition in Central Asia. Particular attention is paid to political alternatives presented by the leading partners of the Central Asian countries - Russia, China, Turkey and Iran. In the context of the rivalry unfolding in the post-Soviet Central Asian space, the multi-vector policy of the five Central Asian states opens up a "window of opportunity" for various external forces to influence political and economic processes in the region in such a way that its states become objects of multilateral contention. Russia, which has the most powerful economic and military-political resource in the CIS, has a serious potential to promote its interests in Central Asia. They are primarily aiming at maintaining political stability in the Asian part of the post-Soviet space. Russia is also initiating many integration innovations in Central Asia, developing military cooperation with the countries of the region. At the same time, in Central Asia, Russia is confronted by rival forces. In the forefront is China. This great power has significantly expanded its influence in Central Asia, especially within the framework of the One Belt, One Road initiative. Economic, political, and cultural structures operating in Central Asia under the aegis of Turkey act often as alternatives to Russian integration projects. But Turkey, like Iran, has restrictions on its activities in Central Asia. Therefore, the effectiveness of the policy of these large Middle Eastern states is lower than that of Russia and China. China, Russia, and Iran are motivated to limit US influence in Eurasia, which occasionally drives them closer. In a sense, Turkey agrees with the idea of reducing the political presence of non-regional states in Central Asia. But when the US ceases to be a priority in the foreign policy of all four states, the rivalry between them may re-emerge. This will inevitably lead to a clash of interests, an increase in competition of ideas, integration projects, political and military strategies.

AB The article examines the process of formation of the political elite in Georgia during the period of independence, starting from the cardinal de-Sovietization of management personnel in the 90s, and ending with the last significant appointments in the era of B. Ivanishvili. The stages of evolution and transformation of the elite are analyzed in detail - under E. Shevardnadze, M. Saakashvili, and B. Ivanishvili, the peculiarities of the personnel policy of this or that Georgian leader are highlighted. Both the very course of the change and rejuvenation of the elite and the change in its educational background and political guidelines are traced. The article shows that despite all these changes the nature of government in Georgia has not been changed. The political regime in Georgia is still a kind of patronage rule. The author examines its characteristic features, analyzes the reasons for survivability of such a form despite repeated changes and political parties in power.

DT Article

   Deng Xiaoping; Xi Jinping; political system reform; national model of

AB The article analyzes the process of growing understanding in China of the need to turn from the primacy of "selfreliance" to the gradual opening of the country, seeing as the development of large-scale diversified economic relations with the outside world. The role of China's leaders of various periods in this process is shown. It is revealed that the main pillars and "engines" of the policy of foreign economic openness of the People's Republic of China were the course of modernization of the country and the active struggle against the leftist ideology. Deng Xiaoping played a prominent role in both trials. The main achievements of the People's Republic of China in the field of foreign economic openness at various stages of the implementation of this policy are briefly shown. In contrast to expectations in the West, the turn to the market and foreign economic openness was not accompanied by political reform and democratization of the country in accordance with the Western model. Beijing often states, that China realizes her own model of consultative democracy which meets national characteristics. Under Xi Jinping, the role of the ruling Communist Party in all spheres of the country's social and political life has been significantly strengthened, and the promotion of the "Chinese way of development" as a possible model for some developing countries has intensified. In the context of increasing Western pressure on China, Beijing, according to the author, can make some indirect concessions in the foreign economic sphere, but not in the political system. At the same time, China is building up its own development potential for key high technologies.

TI Essays by Viktor Ya. Iretsky in the Context of the Journalism of 1917

DT Article

   journalism of post-revolutionary period; Rech' newspaper; V.Ya. Iretsky;
   V.G. Korolenko
AB This article aims to initiate a study of an extremely interesting body of texts by Viktor Ya. Iretsky that were published in the major metropolitan newspaper Rech' [Speech] and caused a resonance in 1917-1918. The study of the originality of the half-forgotten prose writer's revolutionary journalism in the context of the ideological searches of the author's famous contemporaries - M. Gorky, V.G. Korolenko, L.N. Andreev, A.A. Blok, I.A. Bunin - seems relevant. Based on newspaper, magazine, and book collections of the National Library of Russia, the Library of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the House of Russia Abroad, the article analyzes the essays published in Rech' from March 1917 to August 1918 using historical-literary and intertextual research methods. In the course of the research, the author selected the most revealing essays that are comparable to well-known journalistic works about the revolution, analyzed their artistic originality, evolution, and similarity to the journalism of 1917-1918. Iretsky's texts are thematically and ideologically similar to Andreev's articles and diary entries, Korolenko's writings, and - particularly - Gorky's cycle published in Novaya Zhizn' [New Life]; however, theses texts describe the facts, moods, and the revolutionary atmosphere from the point of view of an observer who opposes the revolution and, since May 1917, sees it only as destructive force. The author concludes that Iretsky's essays, reflecting the metamorphoses of the intelligentsia's perception of the revolution, problems close to Gorky's and Korolenko's notes, are more similar to emigrants' diaries, especially Bunin's Cursed Days, in their confessional nature, antiBolshevik pathos and artistry. The specificity of Iretsky's texts is explained by the attention to specific everyday material immersed in the cultural and historical context. The value of the essays is determined by its orientation to everyday life, inclusion of the living tissue of life in the texts; by its confessional nature, which back in 1917 and 1918 revealed a critical emigrant attitude - then expressed in diaries only - to the course of the revolutionary transformation of Russia; and by the inclusion of expressive historical and cultural figurative elements. Abstracting, analyzing the situation from the point of view of European history and culture (including the ideals of the French revolution), using images of works of Russian literature (Dead Souls by Gogol, The Cherry Orchard by Chekhov, The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky, etc.) and reminiscences on them, Iretsky does not approach authors of political pamphlets, but rather such important figures of Russian journalism as Maxim Gorky and Vladimir Korolenko, and the diary prose of the brightest Russian writers.

His cadence turned out to be unique in modern American history: two impeachment procedures, several massive explosions of interethnic riots, and finally the storming of the Capitol. This is him - a businessman with dubious success, a showman, and ultimately - the first person of America. The president is called "on intuition", "non-systemic" - without experience in government structures. However, he was quite successful in deepening the political and ideological divide in his country. And today, almost a year later, those Americans who voted for D. Trump on November 3, 2020 continue to speak of him in positive tones, and the rest - a little more than half of the total number of those who cast their votes - do it in sharply negative manner The period of the 45th president's stay in the White House requires comprehensive understanding.

TI The Place of the Ural Region in the Planning of the USSR's Economic
   Development in 1920-1927
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE USSR; Ural; economy; planning; industrialization; 1920s
AB The relevance of the topic lies in the study of factors that contribute to overcoming the backwardness and rapid development of individual economic regions. One important example of such a model of regional development is the Urals, which in a short time turned from a losing region into one of the pillars of the Soviet economic model. In this regard, the research object is the economic complex of the Ural region with the focus on the planning of the economic development of the Urals and the external economic and political factors that affected it. The chronological framework of the study is determined by the period from the presentation of the GOELRO (State Commission for Electrification of Russia) plan at the VIII Congress of Soviets in 1920 to the approval of the directive on the development of the first five-year plan at the XIV Congress of the CPSU(b) in 1927. It was at this time that the basic principles and proportions of territorial development of the USSR and the Urals were elaborated; they were only strengthened and developed during the first five-year plans. The source base for the study is the long-term development plans of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union, the GOELRO plan, the general plan of the reconstruction of the national economy of the USSR for 15 years, and the general plan of the economy of the Urals for the period from 1927 till 1941. Detailed information about the first two plans was published in the open Soviet press, and the last, the general plan of the economy of the Urals, was fully published. For a more detailed disclosure of the topic, materials from the meeting of the Presidium of the State Planning Committee of the USSR were also involved. The presentation of the results is arranged in chronological order, which allows tracing the evolution of planning authorities' ideas about the ways of development of the Ural economy. The main results of the study are: the idea of a rapid economic development of the country proposed in the GOELRO plan meant for the Urals the creation of new industrial capacities and the gradual approximation of its economic potential to the potential of the Donetsk region. At the same time, the remoteness of the Urals from export-oriented transport routes pushed the central leadership to integrate the Urals with Western Siberia and create a second major industrial base in the East of the country. This vector of development was enshrined in the general plan for the reconstruction of the national economy and the economy of the Urals, and this idea gained a complete form of an inter-territorial project of the Ural-Kuznetsk combine. The development of this vector took place in the conditions of the NEP: however, after the beginning of the transition to a single-person dictatorship and command-based administrative system, the country's top leadership did not abandon this course: on the contrary, it began to implement it in a more hypertrophied form than the developers of the 1920s had anticipated.

AB The proposed article examines the domestic and foreign experience of supporting the innovation process in attracting private, public and foreign investments. The historical experience of the USSR in the implementation of strategic innovative projects has been studied, which has shown that special conditions for budget financing of implementing organizations, as well as strong ties between enterprises, contribute to achieving the goals, although they lead to resources' overspending. Administrative and policy-making approaches have also been used in the practice of South-East Asian countries in order to concentrate financial resources to achieve strategic goals. Attention is paid to the US experience in bridging the gap between basic research and the practical application of their results through the mechanism of venture financing of innovative companies. Universities play a special role in the innovation process in the United States, which are the basis for the formation of innovation clusters. At the same time, the experience of creating techno-parks in modern Russia has shown that it has not yet been possible to significantly influence the innovative activity of private business. The experiences of China and the countries of Eastern Europe show that foreign investments have a positive impact on innovative development in the conditions of high investment attractiveness and the political will of the state to defend its sovereignty. At the moment, Russia cannot count on foreign capital to build a national strategy for innovative development. The domestic and foreign experience of interaction between the defense civil sectors of the economy is considered. Based on our analysis, we have prepared recommendations for improving approaches to supporting the innovation process in Russia, taking into account the current state of the external environment.

DT Article
DE Communist Party of Vietnam; Communist Party of China; CPV; CPC; XIII
   Congress of the CPV
AB The article focuses on the peculiarities of Vietnam's position in the orbit of the ideological and theoretical influence of China. The author examines the most important party documents of both states, reveals their main similarities and differences. The author concludes that Hanoi scrupulously studies, critically assesses, and actively uses the experience of Chinese economic and political reforms. The party and state leadership of Vietnam, when carrying out major transformations of recent decades, was directly guided by the successful experience of their Chinese colleagues. This led to the situation where today's political systems of Vietnam and China are quite similar, but still are not (and will never be) twin brothers. At the same time, the countries developed a wide network of inter-party contacts which is used not only as an instrument of exchanging views on adapting Marxism-Leninism to current realities, but also as an additional and mutually beneficial channel of communication on a wide range of issues. Despite this, the similarity of the political systems does not necessarily lead to a change in foreign policy. China has an impressive array of tools to influence its southern neighbor, but their ideological closeness is definitely not the most important of them. It is concluded that the role of ideology in Vietnam's policy, although it remains noticeable, is significantly inferior to the role of national interests and pragmatic views.

The main objective is to investigate what are the most effective indicators which have led to the declared numbers by countries. Design/methodology/approach This study combined multiple sets of data to describe best the economical status of the health system including the government spending on the health system to draw some conclusion regarding the behavior of the pandemic. Findings Complex emergencies and internal conflicts negatively affected the quality of the reported cases and the size of the pandemic. The health work force was the most determinant factor of the health system. It can sometimes be impossible to understand the epidemic only with epidemiological data or health system one; economical aspects of health system and political situation have to be added to the equation. Originality/value The research according to the authors' knowledge is the most comprehensive comparison so far that investigate the non-covid aspects from a political side in particular in complex emergencies and war situation added health system indicators.

AB The article explores the theoretical and practical aspects of predictability of the future of legal systems based on legal forecasting as a direction of scientific activity, designed to formulate the importance of new vectors of legal development for the state, society and the individual. By combining general theoretic, axiological, personal and instrumental methodological means and expanding the ideological field of jurisprudence, legal forecasting contributes to the realization of social needs and state interests. The conversion of theoretical paradigms of legal forecasting into the practical sphere is ensured by the creation of predictive models of regulations and the development of concrete proposals concerning the modernization of legislation to the law-making bodies.
   At present, there is every reason to speak about the significant shortcomings in the field of legal forecasting both in Russia and worldwide. A clear confirmation of this thesis is the fact that despite the predictability of the coronavirus pandemic (before it was atypical pneumonia, avian influenza, Ebola), no state was ready for full legal regulation in the context of the pandemic and did not think through the legal ways out of it. Operational law-making was conducted everywhere through trial and error, creating internally contradictory and insufficiently effective legal regimes, creating excessive restrictions on human rights and simply legislative confusion, sometimes bordering on absurdities.
   The haphazardness of the legislative process, which legal forecasting is intended to put a barrier to, is expressed among other things in the number of laws adopted. The existence of a significant number of reference rules, supplements and amendments, "changes to changes" manifold hampers the application of rules, while the development of conceptual draft laws is practically an exception. At the federal level, there is no legal forecasting as a direction of scientific support for lawmaking, and planning is limited to the draft laws submitted to the upcoming session of the State Duma. The situation is no better at the regional level.
   All this shows that the system of public administration does not in a due measure rely on the powerful predictive potential inherent in the nature of law and legal thought, which includes the understanding of the nature of law and its diverse manifestations in real public life.
   It follows that the concept of legal forecasting has a universal and timeless significance. It brings together all general theoretical, axiological, personal and instrumental methodological means and provides the conditions for obtaining reliable forecasts regarding the dynamics of legal and related political, economic, social and spiritual phenomena and processes.

AB This article attempts to identify one of the modes of overcoming the internal political conflict in Kabarda through a comparative analysis with the initiatives system of the Russian government to overcome the collision destructive for its interests in the neighboring principality. The work reveals the main attitude of the Russian side towards Greater Kabarda in the period after the conclusion of the Belgrade Treaty of 1739. Though before that Russia showed a desire to preserve the unity of the political elite of the principality as a guarantee of effective opposition to the Crimean expansion in the region, then from the end of the Russian-Ottoman war of 1735-1739 St. Petersburg's goals in relation to traditional partners are undergoing changes. The task of the Russian foreign policy department was to maintain the situation of competition between the two groups of Circassian princes. As the Baksan party was the most consistent counterparty of St. Petersburg since the mid-20s. of the XVIII century, the stake was placed on it. In the spring of 1747, one of the pillars of this group, the feudal Misost clan, was forced to leave the principality. Thus, the stability of Russian influence in the affairs of the "barrier" principality came under threat. This prompted the Russian leadership to try to restore a status-quo acceptable to its interests. The trendsetters for restoring the internal political balance in Kabarda were also the triad of Tlekotlesh clans - Kundet, Tambi (y) and Anzor, dissatisfied with the destabilization of the political system and possessing sufficient ideological and military-political resources to force the dominant princely alliance to agree to the return of the exiles.

DT Article
DE language; ontology; ascription; semantics; legal ontology
AB The article discusses the semantic specifications of sentences that contain status predicates. It is shown that the visually similar predicates "to steal the pen" and "to commit the crime" are in fact fundamentally different. If in the first case we are talking about an action predicate, then in the second about a status predicate. Linguistic analysis identifies the necessary conditions for the correct use of expressions like "Bill committed the crime" in language. Since Bill's actions are not a crime in themselves, the phrase "committed the crime" is not predicted for Bill, but for the actions he committed. As an original example, the judicial precedent is considered, which we come across in M. S. Moore's "Legal Reality: A Naturalist Approach to Legal Ontology". The essence of the work is that Sheriff Kirby violated a federal law, in particular the law of 1790, according to which it is a criminal offense to obstruct the delivery of federal mail. Kirby arrested a postal worker, which undoubtedly slowed down the delivery of the mail. However, during the trial, Kirby himself indicated that he arrested the postal officer since the latter was suspected of murder. Moreover, Kirby acted according to the warrant he received from the state authorities. The court took into account the sheriff's explanation and found him not guilty of obstructing the delivery of federal mail. According to Moore, although Kirby violated the federal law, he was innocent. The court also found that the sheriff's actions were not a crime. The apparent contradiction between the actions of the sheriff and the court's decision is resolved when we attempt to define the non-linguistic conditions for the use of the expression " committed the crime". The presuppositional fund of the speech agent is singled out as such conditions.

DE contemporaneity; contemporary art; modernism; total work of art; Boris
   Groys
AB The authors refer the issue of definition of contemporaneity as cultural and historical totality basing on the research results of a well-known theorist Boris Groys. Analyzing the progress of his ideas, the authors conclude, that the philosopher's considerable contribution to the science is composed of the next phase of the development of the thesis about the art language as the base of contemporaneity construction and of the " natural selection" of contemporary art structures. The latter is not simply reduced to the postmodern "polylogue" variant, but implies a kind of contemporaneity patterns niche and "stabilization". The patterns naturally tend to become complementary due to simple juxtaposition/ overlay in general time context. According to the authors, this circumstance does not prevent them from being turned by different political forces into locally dominating contemporaneity patterns (as in the case of Gesamkunstwerk Stalin). Contemporary art provides simple experience, that helps to retain the illusion of single and seemingly total contemporaneity.
   B. Groys leads us to the thought that art provides conditions for generating a significant reflective distance in relation to different social and historical situations. The distance gives an artist the opportunity to consider the reality comprehensively, given the autonomy, through the art language. However, we believe, that the most important philosopher's achievement is not only drawing parallels between cultural and social and historical processes, based on the concept of art strategies influencing the social dynamics. He also managed to approach one of the most significant issues in culture theory and history - the opportunity to define contemporaneity as cultural and historical totality. According to his modernity theory, the origin of contemporaneity is hidden in the avant-garde art manifestation. He interprets the utopic by its nature modernist discourse, applied in art practice, through Nietzscheian will to power as redefining the new age philosophy.
   This article aims to analyze the progress of the issue of contemporaneity in the works of B. Groys and to explicate the complexity of considering contemporaneity as cultural and historical totality. The authors believe that the thorough study of the phenomenon of total artwork (Gesamtkunstwerk) as a soviet Stalin project and critics' opinion analysis helps to create arguments limiting the opportunity of considering contemporaneity as totality.

AB The article reviews the Russian translation of the book Why Is There Philosophy of Mathematics at All? by Ian Hacking. The book discusses the fundamental problems of the philosophy of mathematics. The author being an analytic philosopher nonetheless refuses the academic analytical style of text presentation and creates a work extraordinarily saturated on the contextual and emotional levels. This review pursues several aims: ostensive, explicative and interpretive. It means, firstly, the review is designed to inform the Russian-speaking reader that, thanks to the talented translation, there is an opportunity to read an unusual and extremely relevant philosophical text. Secondly, the description of the structural and thematic framework of the book allows understanding the "labyrinth" of the author's references, examples and narrative lines. Thirdly, the reviewer interprets key antagonistic pairs, in fact agreeing with the author's anthropocentric measurement of ontological problems of mathematics. The free style of the review completely corresponds to the tonality of the considered text.

AB The article considers the feminist and anti-feminist ideas of the Russian historian and sociologist Maksim Kovalevsky. Domestic thinkers largely contributed to the emergence in Russia of feminism as a social phenomenon and the theory of feminism in the history of Russian social thought. The specifics of historical, cultural, legal, economic development influenced the understanding of many issues within the framework of social sciences, including the need to study the "female question" in sociology. The article reflects the results of a theoretical study in which Kovalevsky's ideas about the position of women in society were analyzed. The problem of the status of women in society was noticeably expressed at the turn of the 20th century. Kovalevsky is one of the most famous Russian classical sociologists who contributed to the development of this issue. He created the well-known theory of the family, in the framework of which the position of women in society was considered. In his works, Kovalevsky challenged the idea of some domestic and foreign thinkers about the subordinate position of a woman in society and rather pointed to her relative autonomy in family development, noting the tendency of her gaining more freedom in the future. As a deputy of the I State Duma, Kovalevsky participated in the discussion of the issue of civil equality and the provision of political equality for women. Professor Kovalevsky was directly involved in the organization of higher education for women and in teaching. For Kovalevsky, the question of the position of women was associated with the doctrine of solidarity and the concept of progress. According to the scientist, the emancipation of women is included in the general order of social development. Following the logic of the movement of social progress assumed by Kovalevsky, the position of women in society will change in line with the general trend of growth in the emancipation of the individual.

AB In this article, I analyze one version of the criticism of Parmenides' thesis "what-is is one" in Plato (Soph. 244c8-9) and two versions of criticism of this thesis in Aristotle (Phys. A, 3). Plato bases his refutation on the assumption that Parmenides, who pronounced his thesis, must agree with the presence of two different entities - the name "what-is" and the name "one", but it contradicts his thesis. The first version of Aristotle's criticism asserts that in Parmenides' thesis "one" as a property is different from "what-is" as a property, ergo etc. The second version of Aristotle's criticism asserts that in Parmenides' thesis "what- is" as a property is different from what it is inhered in, ergo etc. I have shown that all three versions of criticism are effective against Parmenides' thesis in the case of the interpretation of "what-is" in it as a real object. I have also shown that in the case of the interpretation of "what-is" Parmenides' thesis as a mental object, which is an internal object of the act of thinking, none of the versions refutes this thesis. In justifying my conclusions, I have used the notation for propositional attitudes reports with epistemic operators. Also, I have interpreted an internal object of thinking as an abstract object that encodes the characteristics, which are attributing to it in the act of thinking, but at the same time this abstract object is also capable of exemplifying some characteristics. I have used the exemplification-encoding distinction from E. Zalta's theory of abstract objects. In rewriting the three versions of Parmenides' refutation for the case of mental objects, I have replaced "names" and "what a property is inherent in" with abstract mental objects, and "properties" with characteristics encoded by abstract objects, whose characteristics are also mental objects. I have shown that the formalization of the first version of Aristotle's criticism could contain non-predicative functions in the sense of Principia Mathematica. I have revealed the structural similarity of Plato's refutation with the second version of Aristotle's refutation. The same can be said about the blocking of these refutations that I have considered.

   Competition
AB The International Tchaikovsky Competition has been held for sixty years and has become a tradition with an intention to renew itself. An essential aspect of this is the webcast, which, being performed at the highest level, not only develops the established democratic orientation of this competition, but makes the competition a relatively independent artistic event.
   The empirical base of the research is Internet broadcasting of XV and XVI competitions. Method - a comparative analysis, performed in the context of cultural knowledge.
   The article analyzes the features of the modern Internet broadcast of the competition, which distinguish it from previous TV and Internet broadcasts. The specific difficulties of shooting musical events related to their duration and the static of what is happening, as well as the resources that were used by the director and operators of "Medici.tv" in the creative solution of these problems, were understood. It is shown that the perception of the online broadcast of the competition is not inferior in terms of artistic criteria to the impression that the listener who attends the concert receives, but this is a different impression, not canceling, but supplementing the traditional one.
   On this basis, the conclusion is formed that the Internet broadcasting enriches the artistic culture. It provides the audience with new opportunities for creative perception of an artistic work. In addition, the webcast allows the art critic to carry out research on the phenomena of the performing arts at a fundamentally different level, to increase the degree of reliability of the knowledge gained. Previously, the theory of performing arts relied on an unreliable empirical research base: a single viewing and listening to a concert version of a work and memories of it.
   Webcasting allows multiple viewing and listening, verification of the findings, including through the use of computer programs, which allows one to overcome the degree of subjectivity that is unacceptable for science, which is inevitably present in art criticism, based on the empirical experience of a researcher attending a concert, protects against the accidents of perception that lie in wait for the listener in the concert hall. And the theory of performance objectively becomes on a par with other branches of art history - the theory of painting, architecture, musicology, studying musical notation, etc.
   The webcast changed the status of the Tchaikovsky Competition. Initially, in 1958, it was conceived and implemented as, first of all, a socio-political event, marking the beginning of the period of the "policy of openness" pursued by the leadership of our country. Thanks to the webcast, the competition has become a completely self-sufficient event - it exists as a "piece of art", which you can which can be enjoyed again and again, just as we re-read works of classical literature over and over again.

AB The author examines the features of the economic ethics of Russian spiritual Christians-Molokans, analyzes the connection between people's religious views and economic behavior. The novelty of the work consists in an attempt to systematize the elements of the Molokans' economic ethics, to explain the reasons for their formation from a religious and sociological point of view in their relationship, to show that the analysis of their progressive experience is useful in the formation of a new economic ethics in modern Russia. The author lists the factors that led to the formation of the Molokan economic ethics based on biblical texts. Among these factors, he singles out: the lack of asceticism, rejection of religious mysticism and faith in oneself, the combination of agricultural labor with other types of activity, the predominance of the personally free population, the rejection of equal land use, the high level of literacy of the Molokans, the deprivation of many civil rights, the equality of men and women in the family, the lack of a mandatory fasting schedule and a large number of holidays, migrant activity, the habit of high adaptability to changing living conditions. The author explains why the Bible was a practical guide for the economic activities of the Molokans, but did not become one for the Orthodox population. He argues that the books of the Bible contain advice on almost all elements of economic ethics, but in order to put them into the basis of economic activity it was necessary to know the Bible perfectly, in pre-revolutionary Russia it was possible only for a small part of the literate population. Therefore, it was within the framework of this sect in Russia that economic ethics was formed as an integral set of views on the correct management of the economy. The author concludes that since in our time the Bible is the publicly available primary source of faith for all Christians and its economic recommendations are universal for the entire believing population, Christian economic ethics, due to the common source of faith, can only be one, despite the many dogmatic differences and contradictions between Christian confessions and sects.

DE periodization of history; criteria for periodization; Japanese Buddhism;
   Gukansho
AB This study analyzes the philosophical underpinnings of the periodization of Japanese history proposed by the Tendai monk Jien (1155-1225) in the early 13th century within the framework of Japanese Buddhism. The research is based on the historiosophical writing Gukansho (c. 1221). In Gukansho, Jien linked the idea of historical causation to Buddhism cosmology and offered a periodization of his country's history in terms of Japanese Buddhism. It is well known among Japanologists that Jien divided Japanese history into seven periods according to invisible and visible principles - dori. After a textual analysis of Gukansho, the author has concluded that invisible principles are rules determined by the cosmic world order and visible principles are rules determined by the worldly power and order. The textual analysis allows distinguishing three other periodization schemes depending on various criteria: 1) three traditionally designated epochs (ancient times, recent ancient times, present days); 2) three periods corresponding to the three ages of the deterioration of the Buddhist Doctrine (The True Law, The Semblance Law, The Latter Day of the Law); 3) four periods due to the form of rulership (an emperor, an emperor and a regent, an ex-emperor, an emperor with a shogun and a regent). The author shows that the four classifications do not conflict with each other. They are closely interrelated and organize historical data to legitimize the supreme power of the imperial house, the Fujiwara regency and the military rule. The traditional periodization is a simple scheme reflecting empirical observation. The three other schemes are based on the theoretical framework and shaped by the Buddhist cosmological worldview and the theory of the three ages of Buddhism. These three classifications create a causative context for historical events. They reveal the up-and-down course of Japanese history working towards degeneracy. The four forms of rulership are ways of adjusting to different stages of the deteriorating half of the kalpa. The traditional tripartite periodization is included in this philosophical system by being grounded on the doctrine of the three ages of Buddhism.

TI TWO MODES OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE STRUCTURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS

AB It has been substantiated that there is not only explicit self-consciousness but there is also tacit, implicit self-consciousness in the structure of consciousness. The author has revealed that so called from-to model of individual consciousness and tacit knowing, proposed by the 20th-century philosopher of science M. Polanyi, is applicable to self-consciousness. According to this model, interaction of two kinds of awareness is at the very core of any cognitive act - focal and subsidiary awareness. In every act of tacit knowing we attend from subsidiaries to a focus whose object they give a rise. Within the framework of Polanyi's conception of personal knowledge, corporeality is of great importance, which constitutes the realm of tacit, subsidiary clues. If we extend the structure of individual consciousness to the processes of self-consciousness, then reflection may be considered as overt, explicit self-consciousness. In the process of reflection, the image of one's self, the most significant personal characteristics are in the focus of attention. Explicit self-consciousness is most fully embodied in a narrative, a life story. Narrativity constitutes a stable conceptual image of one's self, ensures the unity of the internal experience, gives a new meaning to the events in one's life. In its turn, tacit self-consciousness embraces subsidiary components of personal experience which determine a person's individuality. It underlies both self-cognition and cognition of the surrounding reality. The primary mode of implicit self-consciousness is the awareness of embodied self which manifests itself during motor activity. The embodied self proves to be an active and independent subject capable of performing purposeful actions voluntarily. Based on the analysis of the neural "central monitoring hypothesis of action recognition", it has been concluded that the image of the embodied self is brought into correlation with the subjective model of one's own action. The internal model of motor activity has been considered to be the basis of embodied, tacit self-consciousness. By means of the neurophysiological "simulation theory", it has been shown that images of our supposed movements constitute the realm of tacit, covert actions which are combined with overt actions. Covert actions affect the content of tacit knowledge, underlie implicit self-consciousness and seem to be essential conditions for the cognition and transformation of the surrounding reality.

DE professional dynasty; scientific environment; status transmission;
   status capital; transprofessional mobility
AB The present study focuses on academic dynasty as implementation of the concept of "professional dynasty". It states that, in modern socio-humanitarian science, the approach focusing not on the descriptiveness of academic dynasties' achievements, but on the investigation of the problems of sustainability in professional values reproduction within the sociology of professions and in the context of professional structures transformation, with emphasis on not only constructive, but also destructive social effects of a dynasty, is becoming relevant. Within this approach, the author sets the problem of studying the patterns and features of the constructing of images of a professional dynasty in the modern Russian scientific environment. This will allow applying some "objective" parameters of the existence of academic dynasties as a social group to an imaginary identity. According to the empirical data obtained during interviews, the objectives are set to identify the features of positive and negative dynasty image design by members of the interviewed families, and to focus on the procedure and factors for the creation of retrospective and perspective images of their families as professional dynasties. The author draws a connection between the constructed image of a professional dynasty in general (its advantages and disadvantages as such) and the perception of oneself as a real participant in family dynasty strategies. In the latter case, it is possible to classify the obtained data into three groups, approximately equal in quantitative terms, in line with the "emotional" attribute - positive, neutral and skeptical. Of these, the first two form a fairly stable and effective image of dynastic ties in professional trajectories. It is also noted that the "skepticism" of the respondents' interpretations (group 3) derive from these three factors: concentration on personal efforts in the profession, underestimation of their own contribution to family achievements, and either complete or partial failure of professional self-realization. The author also notes that the various evaluations that account for the transformations of the professional dynasty as a social phenomenon are attributable to the action of socio-psychological factors, such as characteristics of family members affecting the productivity of interpersonal interaction within the dynasty, the specificity of scientific creative activities as a special social environment, and the psychological basis of social interaction.

DE logicism; transcendentalism; foundations of mathematics; a priori
   knowledge; analytical and synthetic judgments
AB The article presents a comparative analysis of the views of Frege and Kant on the nature of mathematical propositions. The author of the article puts the distinction between the epistemological and logico-semantic justification of knowledge as the basis for comparing Kant's transcendental approach and Frege's logicism. The first is carried out by referring to the process of thinking and to the subject's mind. The second considers the objective conditions for the truth of propositions and aims to make the truth of propositions as obvious as possible by the rigorous logical proof of the latter. In Kant's interpretation, the structure of the justification of mathematical knowledge contains an essential reference to the a priori faculties of our reason. Frege's interest lies in revealing the objective relations between propositions that lie in the foundation of mathematics. For Frege, the proof of mathematical propositions must be an invariable and objective sequence of truths that are fundamentally independent of the subject's thinking. However, Frege tends to refer exclusively to the laws of logic in the proof of arithmetic propositions. Such an explanation of mathematics through logic has its own epistemological motive. Frege hopes that mathematics, as well as logic, will have a priori laws of thought as its subject. If it were technically possible to prove that mathematics is an objective extension of logic, the epistemological question about the nature of mathematical knowledge would also be answered. Obviously, the method of transcendental philosophy is not applicable to such a narrow task. However, it is wrong to interpret Frege's logicism as overcoming Kant's transcendentalism. The transcendental method, within the framework of the problem of the nature of mathematics, probably has a place, but only as a solution to the epistemological question of how we know or understand mathematical judgments. Nevertheless, Frege's works consistently reject some of Kant's particular ideas. His criticism of the idea of justifying mathematical knowledge by appealing to space and time, and his demand to pay attention to the proof of mathematical propositions certainly modify and replace the definitions of a priori, a posteriori, analytical, and synthetic knowledge given by Kant.

AB Based on the analysis of strategic foreign policy approaches of the Democrats that came to power in the United States, the article examines the promising directions of the development of Russian-American relations under the new Biden administration in terms of Russia's national security. The article focuses on the similarities and differences between the policies of the Democrats and the Republicans on this issue. As the study shows, we cannot expect a total confrontation in all areas of the development of Russian-American relations in the coming years. Where it is profitable, the United States will try to ensure its interests through negotiations. At the same time, according to the author, in the post-Soviet space, in the most important regions of the world, the United States will take all measures to put pressure on Russia, strengthen confrontation in relations with it in order to prevent the strengthening of Russia's position and influence in the modern world. Under the pretext of fighting for human rights in order to destabilize the domestic political situation and change the political regime, the Biden administration will try to organize a color revolution in our country.

DE local self-government bodies; harmonization of interethnic relations;

   Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)
AB The solving of the problems of harmonizing interethnic relations and strengthening Russian identity is directly related to the organizing of the management of Russia's state nationality policy (RSNP) implementation at the municipal level. The analysis of the local self-government (LSG) management in the field of RSNP implementation is becoming very relevant, and the issue of determining LSG's main and secondary activities in the field of RSNP implementation is a primary task, which became the aim of the article. The article is based on the data of the author's expert survey "Features of the Implementation of the State National (Ethnic) Policy in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)". The author used instrumentalist methodology, the theory of constructing social reality; in parallel, the existence of the relationship between culture, institutional processes, and social development is recognized. In view of the small number of domestic publications on the RSNP implementation at the local level, the author used works of R. Valiev, S. Minyurova about Sverdlovsk Oblast. The LSG of the national republic organizes activities for RSNP implementation very inertly. The author has found that, in practice, the specifics of the ethnic structure, the probability of interethnic interaction and people's immersion in a different environment are poorly taken into account. It would seem that the national character of the region actualizes work on harmonizing interethnic relations; nevertheless, it is not a priority for most of Yakutia's LSG, as well as for municipal authorities of other Russian regions, such as Sverdlovsk Oblast. At the same time, there is a certain dependence between LSG's activities and the importance of the problems associated with the rights of the indigenous peoples of the North. The territories of the minority peoples' predominant residence, in their practice, use means to support native languages and the traditional way of life more often and more actively. The comparative analysis of the experience of Yakutia and Sverdlovsk Oblast showed identical problems in RSNP implementing at the local level: weak interest in solving issues in the field of interethnic interaction; lack of integration with scientific institutions; weak horizontal and vertical interconnection in organizing the exchange of experience; a narrow range of mechanisms for harmonizing interethnic relations and strengthening unity. The limited financial and human resources of local authorities make the search for new forms of work, the importance of research, and the active development of digital technologies urgent. In general, the study and its results emphasize that, if the regional and federal levels have formed the basics of work in the field of RSNP, the local government remains aloof from the process of strengthening civic identity, ethnocultural diversity and interethnic relations.

DE secularization; postsecular society; desecularization; political
   religion; modernization
AB The author believes that the postsecular society in Russia has a number of features that distinguish it from the European model. The specifics of the postsecular society in Russia are determined by the form of Soviet secularization and the cultural and sociopolitical context within which the transition to postsecularity was taking place. The author considers Soviet secularization through the concept of political religion, the essence of which is the sacralisation of social and political phenomena and the replacement of the transcendental sacred with the immanent. The results of Soviet secularization were different from those of Western secularization. In particular, legal worldview pluralism, which had become the norm for Western secular societies, was not possible in Soviet society, no "market of religions" emerged, etc. The weakening and collapse of the Soviet regime determined the context in which Russian society was transitioning to a postsecular state, and this context was different from that in Europe. The author identifies the following features of the postsecular society in Russia. (1) Acute polemics related to the presence of religion in secular spheres (education, science, army, etc.). More often, there is no dialogue between the bearers of secular and religious worldviews, but their confrontation, which is complicated by explicit or implicit government intervention. (2) Convergence between the state and the dominant religious organisation, the Russian Orthodox Church. In Western societies, the postsecular activization of religious organisations does not lead to a stronger connection between the state and any religious groups. (3) Religion has been revived in Russia not so much to perform its own religious function - to save the soul, but to solve a number of worldly tasks - ideological, cultural and identificational. The postsecular Russian Orthodoxy reminds a secular religion. 4) Russia's transition to a postsecular state was due to: a change in the policy of the authorities towards religion; a transition from suppression to religious freedom, which was later replaced by a policy of supporting traditional religions and restricting all others; the fall of the Soviet regime and its political religion; the formation of a new state and the problem of its legitimisation; anomie and a crisis of values in society, which is used to having the only official worldview supported by the state. These factors, along with the legacy of Soviet secularization, predetermined the form of religious revival and the characteristics of the Russian postsecular society.

   analysis
AB The aim of the study is to find an answer to the questions of what determines the political longevity of "old-timer" governors and what personal qualities help them to stay on the political arena for a long period of time. A political and psychological analysis of three "experienced" governors was carried out to achieve this aim. The results allowed extrapolating the data to the rest of the "old-timers" of the current governor's corps, but with some reservations. The governors' personalities were examined using a comparative case study method. The first block of research is associated with the study of the politician's life path using the biographical method; the second part is linked with the construction of their motivation-and-need profile within three levels: cognitive, affective and behavioral. All the components of the levels were studied by remote assessment, but with the use of qualitative and quantitative content analysis of spontaneous texts of heads of regions, non-included observation and indepth interviews with experts. The material for the analysis was publications in electronic mass media, analytical works of research institutes, materials of official websites of governors, Internet resources with biographical and other information about them. The high complexity of the Self-concept with the presence of low and adequate self-esteem was highlighted among the personal traits of "old-timer" governors. Resistance to stress is manifested at the affective level while extraversion with a high level of dominance and predominance of the achievement motive are on the behavioral level. These and other personal features remained important during the election period and during the appointment of governors. It is possible to assume that the personality of the head of the region in a certain way influenced the transformation of the institution of governorship, which led to the demand for a personal model in the implementation of the modern personnel policy. In turn, "old-timers" also try to meet the requirements for new governors: they become more open, receive a second humanitarian education, etc., skillfully balancing between the federal center and the capabilities of the region itself. The similarity of personal characteristics, the long term in office, the prosperous sociopolitical situation in the region, adequate support of the federal government by the population of the region, stable support in governor elections of the three governors suggest that all this can contribute to the politicians' long-term service as governors of the region, despite the presence of the effect of fatigue in relation to other politicians.

AB Comparative studies of Frege's and Husserl's legacy do not lose intensity during seven decades. The aim of the article is the comprehension of preconditions and the main directions of those issues. The author considers Frege's Review of Dr. E. Husserl's Philosophy of Arithmetic (1894) as the historical precedent which is a prerequisite for a comparative research of Husserl and Frege. The diversions between Frege and Husserl regarding the concept of number are significant for setting up boundaries of logicism. Nevertheless, the author argues the nourishing source of the comparative analysis of Frege's and Husserl's doctrines is not their contradictions but their resemblance. The scholars worked out the problem of clean thinking (reinen Denken), which derives its categories from its development. They both tried to overcome the subjectivism and psychologism, free the logical categories from the psychological content. They both understood thought as the objective, universal entity that is independent of carriers. The scholars had common ontological and epistemological stances. The fact of their mutual criticism arouses keen interest in this context. This criticism invoked the resonance in such directions of the comparative studies as (1) discussion of the problem of Frege's and Husserl's psychologism and anti-psychologism; (2) assessment of the influence of Frege's ideas on the origin of phenomenology; (3) the search for the roots of the separation between phenomenology and analytic philosophy. The author considers the understanding of "psychologism" and its subsequent reception by Willard, Hanna, Dammett, Kusch, Mohanty, and Centrone. After that the author outlines the points of comparing in the early logical and mathematical works by Frege and Husserl (the concepts of number, multitude, equivalency; singular terms; proper names; indexicals; substitutivity). Further, the author concerns the discussion by Follesdal, Mohanty, Rosado Haddock, Ierna, Zuh, and Kunne regarding the question of whether Frege's criticism was crucial to form phenomenology or not. In conclusion, the author considers the searches of the origins of the "gap" between analytic and phenomenological philosophy. The latter was detected by Dammett, Parsons, Cobb-Stevens, Willard, Ruin, Ladov, and others in the logical and semantic pioneering of Frege and Husserl.

AB According to some critics, if biology is a kind of reverse engineering for the nature, it is quite poorly prepared for the task. Thus, the issue is more likely with its ontology. Multiple hypotheses and conjectures found in papers on methodological issues claim that living systems should be viewed as complex networks of signal-transmitting paths, both neural and non-neural, that feature modularity and feedback circuits and are prone to emergent properties and increasing complexity. If so, we are on the eve of a new stage in computer models development where not only computers are used to emulate life, but life itself is construed as a complex network of interacting natural computers.

DE capitalism; conceptual history; Russia; Russian; Populists; Slavophiles;
   Marxists
AB Traditionally, capitalism as a phenomenon is comprehended in the framework of two approaches: civilizational and world-system. The research of capitalism, presented in the article, is based on the conceptual history methodology that allows reconstructing the discursive history of "capitalism". This methodology open the opportunity to discover "Russian roots" in the history of the emergence of the concept "capitalism", furthermore, to propose the opinion that "capitalism" is a Russian project. The starting point is that Marx never used the concept " capitalism". It literally "grew" from the translation of Marx's Capital into Russian and the discussions around it initiated by the Narodnaya Volya [People's Freedom] members, Slavophiles and Marxists. It happened long before the emergence of Weber's and Sombart's works, which are given precedence in the popularization of the concept "capitalism". The key thesis of the research is that Russian politicians, philosophers and writers laid the Russian-language foundation of the Marxist and liberal methodology of understanding capitalism. They "forged" this concept from Marx's Capital, fixed its meaning and content in Marxist (Russian Marxists) and liberal (liberal members of the Narodnaya Volya) terms; this is why the Marxist and partly liberal understanding of capitalism is Russian. The idea is discussed that the Slavophiles' doctrine formed the special "spirit' of capitalism as a Western image of evil, which provided for the negative connotation of the capitalism concept. The research has shown that the concept " capitalism" became commonly used in Russian political literature (S.N. Rusanov, a Narodnaya Volya member and later a Socialist Revolutionary, is believed to be the first to start the popularization of the concept "capitalism" in the print media) and also emerged and was fixed in Russian dictionaries before it happened in European countries. It is likely that the concept "capitalism" was translated into other European languages based on the Russian original of the Marxist concept of capitalism, and with this meaning and content it entered into Western dictionaries. It means that the basis of the Marxist and partly liberal understanding of capitalism for the European world is Russian.

AB The article discusses the relevant problem of the spread of political innovation in world practice. The main research method is the analysis of publications on the problems of policy diffusion, widely represented in the world and only slightly in Russia. The work aims to review publications on the problems of policy diffusion, analyze theoretical and methodological approaches to its study, assess the current state of research on policy diffusion, determine its promising directions and special factors of the Russian case. The analysis of publications on policy diffusion shows that the focus of the general discussion is on issues of a paradigmatic nature: definition of the concept, research methods, development of theories of policy diffusion, and application of theoretical approaches to the analysis of existing practices. The most elaborated and coordinated in scientific discourse is the concept of policy diffusion, and the most significant problem that needs to be studied is the operationalization of the concept, taking into account the mechanisms of policy dissemination and related implementation practices. The directions of further research are the search for valid and reliable methods of measuring policy diffusion; the conceptualization of its practices; the study of its communicative mechanisms, such as "diffuse networks"; the study of non-institutionalized forms of policy reception. The generalization of the review allowed determining the special conditions for the demand for policy diffusion research in Russia: the maturity of the object of study, i.e., the independence of policy subjects in the choice of development strategies, which is possible only in the context of the further democratization in political governance; and the spread of policy diffusion practices as a result of decentralization in political decision-making. The authorities in Russia always strive to control even the free democratic processes of communication; therefore, mandatory mechanisms of policy diffusion will be of particular importance. As a scientific problem, this can be expressed through the search for the justification of ways to manage political freedoms; these ways assume that public administration goes to a more complex level of interaction with society.

ID GRAFFITI
AB Street art is an important global sociocultural phenomenon which is of interest to many researchers in the social sciences and humanities. Street art is a specific way of communication since street artists, through their topical social and political works, involve audience in a dialogue. In this regard, this article discusses street art from the perspective of its communication features. The first fundamental communication feature of street art is its location in the street and, as a consequence, its contraposition to museum and gallery art. In this respect, communication initiated by a street artist is able to cover potentially more people than a museum that addresses a limited audience. Street artists create artworks for all city residents. From this point of view, street art contributes to the democratization of contemporary art. Secondly, street art is of mandatory nature for the audience since it initially exists in the urban context and thus takes away the choice from the audience. Thirdly, street art appeals to an unready viewer, and, from this point of view, it also opposes museum art since visiting a museum is determined by a person's willingness to interact with artworks. Finally, the street artist's message is extremely ephemeral. The author of the article examines this last feature in more detail and refers to data collected from a series of expert interviews. The author explores experts' attitudes and opinions on ephemerality as one of street art's communication features. In addition, the author analyzes current methods of overcoming street art's impermanence. Among these methods are the restoration of eradicated and time-worn street artworks and the museumification of street art, that is its inclusion into the museum and gallery space. Often, museumification concerns those street art pieces that for various reasons have disappeared from city surfaces. The author explores experts' attitudes towards these instruments of street art conservation. The attitudes are highly controversial: some experts highly appreciate the methods of overcoming street art's ephemerality because they mainstream street art for the urban population, while others, on the contrary, deny the necessity of these instruments because they radically change the nature of street art. The author comes to the conclusion that currently there is no consensus in the expert community on the issue of street art's ephemerality and the necessity to conserve it.

AB The Old Belief, which acts as a true keeper of Russianness and tradition, now is the object of interests of separate researchers - historians, ethnographers, religious scholars - limited by the methods of their own disciplines. In fact, the Russian Orthodox Old Belief has always been distinguished by the highest parsimony in relation to everyday culture, social roles and structures, Russian literature, behavioral models - everything that constitutes the traditional mentality. Displaced to the periphery of modernized empire, the Old Believers proved able to organize stable and self-reproducing communities and subsequently actively participate in development of the Russian economy, science, technology and culture. Later, upon emigration from the USSR to other countries, the Old Believers managed to organize enclaves, which are financially prosperous, economically self-sufficient and respectfully preserving their cultural heritage to this day. Our task is to create an integrative culturological metadiscipline: methodologically rigorous, interpretively tolerant, factually rich, dialogue-oriented. We believe to provide a fundamental review publication, summarizing all attempts to research and understand the Old Believers (culturologists, religious scholars, historians, ethnologists and ethnographers, political scientists, economists, sociologists, literary critics and linguists, philosophers, ideologists, publicists, writers). Our work tasks: 1) involvement of the scientific community in an interdisciplinary dialogue; 2) development of a comparative methodology for the study of ancient Orthodoxy; 3) introduction of Old Believers as a semiotically rich object available for research in different levels of humanitarian knowledge. Our goal is to identify those aspects of the Russian traditional mentality that made it possible for Old Believers to implement an original model of Russian modernization - flexible, attentive to the innovations of science and technology, responsive to world social shifts, but carefully preserving and reproducing the heritage of ancestors, a living connection with traditional culture, history, language. Independence, self-sufficiency, comradeship, family values - preserved and constantly displayed by Old Believers - these features are relevant in our time and instrumental in search of Russia for its place in an open multi-polar world. The search for these principles is a duty of modern Russian Humanities scholar and a scientific super task of our own. The establishment of a new topical metadiscipline of Old Believers' studies, the launch of a humanitarian research dialogue, development and refinement of a new and flexible methodology, acquaintance of researchers of the Old Belief and traditional culture with facts and assessments from other fields of knowledge - these are the marks of scientific significance of our project.

DE rule-following; understanding; mathematical practice
AB The problem of understanding, one of the significant topics for the later stage of Wittgenstein's philosophy, replete with appeals to the use of mathematical symbols, caused, as they say, an ambiguous reaction among both mathematicians who took the time to look into them and among the philosophers of mathematics proper. However, the publication in 1982 of S. Kripke's book Wittgenstein on Rules and Individual Language sparked a boom in research centered around Wittgenstein's alleged argument for skepticism. A feature of Kripke's argumentation was the presentation of an arithmetic example, which was linked to the general philosophy of Wittgenstein, whose later philosophy was replete with paradoxical statements like this: even if a mathematician fully understands the definitions and terms in the proof, he may still not believe it. Such statements clearly contradicted mathematical practice, and yet many philosophers were able to link this paradoxicality with the leading theme of Wittgenstein's thinking, namely with the so-called rule-following problem. It is believed that the focus of the later Wittgenstein is on the problem of understanding, in its broadest sense; and, since his skepticism is seen in mathematical examples, it is natural to consider the problem of understanding in the process of mathematical proof. An essential role in the analysis of Wittgenstein's understanding is played by the concept of rule-following and its skeptical interpretation, which problematizes the establishment of the correctness of following a rule. We have Wittgenstein's key recognition that the learning process in a community tends to lead to a tendency for all members to give the same answers, and it is this circumstance that is the criterion for a "correct" answer. In other words, the answers are the same, despite radical conventionalism, because the members of the community are playing the same language game. Another way to express this circumstance is that they all share the same life form. But, at the same time, we do not understand (or do not comprehend) the rule that determines our choice of the "correct" sequence extension according to the concept of a mathematical function. The point is that we share a common concept because we agree in our answers. Working mathematicians are unlikely to agree that they are talking about the same results because they play the same language game. For the most part, working mathematicians share the Platonist view that they discover mathematical objects and mathematical truths. Wittgenstein's anti-Platonist position leads him, from their point of view, to a skeptical conclusion. In fact, Wittgenstein admitted that there is no explanation as to why we tend to agree in our answers. Is not there a certain kind of a tension here between the analysis of Wittgenstein's work in line with the general philosophy of language and its application to mathematical practice? If so, then this important circumstance requires special attention, since a skeptical argument appeals to albeit simple but mathematical examples.

AB The growing importance of the religious factor and religious identities in modern social and political practices, the inclusion of religious meanings in the spheres of public and international politics predetermine the research interest in examining the religious situation in Russia. Research on this topic is conducted in sociological, political, historical, philosophical and other contexts. At the same time, national polls and studies cannot fully reflect the entire variety of situations in Russian regions, which requires regional studies. In addition, the relevance of the issue is determined by the fact that the authorities' underestimation of the role of the religious factor, a belated response to interethnic and interfaith contradictions can lead to an increase in tension, and sometimes to open conflicts. The article analyzes the current religious situation in Udmurtia on the basis of an ethnosociological study conducted in November-December 2020. The sample size was 1,600 respondents representing the adult urban and rural population of the republic aged 18 years and older, broken down by sex, age cohorts, education level and type of settlement (the statistical error does not exceed 3% with a confidence level of 0.95). As a result of the study, the following conclusions were made. A stable inter-confessional situation remains in Udmurtia. The general indicators of the population's religiosity demonstrate the persistence of long-term trends and generally correspond to the national characteristics. The number of believers changes insignificantly; there are no serious reasons for correcting this trend. The religious landscape of the republic has developed and any significant changes can hardly be expected. Religious organizations should adjust their activities in a number of key areas in order to increase the involvement of believers in religious life. The analysis shows that residents of the region with a low material income, low level of education and young people somewhat more often demonstrate distrust of representatives of other confessions and admit the possibility of conflicts on religious grounds in Udmurtia. In this regard, the authorities are encouraged to work more actively with these categories of citizens. In addition, it is necessary to constantly monitor the religious situation and monitor interfaith relations in the region.

   technological breakthrough; weakening of the USA; change of the world

AB One of the main accusations directed toward globalization is that it deepens the gap between the developed and developing countries dooming them to eternal backwardness. The article demonstrates that the actual situation is very different. It is shown that this is due to globalization that the developing countries are generally growing much faster than the developed states. The World System core starts weakening while its periphery gains strength. At the same time there is a continuing divergence between the main bulk of developing countries and the group of the poorest developing states. The article also explains why globalization was bound to lead to an explosive rise of many developing countries and relative weakening of the developed economies. In the forthcoming decades this trend is likely to continue (though, of course, not without certain interruptions). It is also demonstrated that this convergence constitutes a necessary condition for the ongoing and forthcoming change of political and power balance in the World System. We also show how and why it manifests itself in the US current and possible future policy.

DE regionalism; regionalist movements; Switzerland; center-regional

AB The article looks into characteristics of regionalist movements in contemporary Switzerland. The authors try to answer the question why, despite the stability of federal relations in Switzerland and the existence of institutions representing the interests of the regions, there are regionalist movements in the canton of Ticino and the Bernese Jura, and why only in these two regions? The study is based on open data on the political and socio-economic characteristics of the regions, as well as on materials of research interviews with representatives of movements and experts. The study analyzes the cases of the regionalist movements of the League of Ticino and the Groupe Belier in the Bernese Jura. The results point to the similarities of the movements: linguistic minorities surrounded by a German-speaking majority, accumulation of similar contradictions over the years. The regionalism of the League of Ticino stands out in the context of other parties; the League has made the regionalist agenda a platform for promoting right-wing demands without being marginalized in the political space. The Groupe Belier, from the point of view of regionalist demands, is distinguished by a weak visibility of its agenda in political parties' programmes.

DE KORUS FTA; South Korea; Republic of Korea; United States (US); ROK-US
   alliance; President Trump; tariffs; trade deficit; trade balance
AB The article presents a study of the South Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) and is divided into two parts. In the first part, the author briefly addresses the background of the agreement and explores in detail the current state of the KORUS FTA after its modification in 2018. The author examines key modifications made in the agreement and their influence on the Republic of Korea (ROK), the United States, and the ROK-US alliance. The first part also analyzes why President Trump, instead of delaying the KORUS issue, pushed its revision in 2017, when the situation on the Korean Peninsula was quite explosive, and the motives of the Trump administration in resuming Section 232 investigation, particularly into imports of semiconductors. In the second part, the author addresses future prospects of the agreement in general and briefly analyzes its impact on the ROK-US alliance. The author does not attempt to evaluate the quality of the alliance by measuring the state of the KORUS FTA. Nevertheless, while the trade agreement does not reflect all the strengths or weaknesses of the alliance, it is one of the criteria of the alliance development. Statistical data is employed throughout the article to illustrate the trade imbalance between South Korea and the US, import and export volume, and opinion survey results. In conclusion, the author sums up the results obtained and highlights the importance of the KORUS FTA for the ROK-US alliance. The relevance of the article lies in the fact that the work is based primarily on foreign sources and literature, which allows expanding the knowledge base of domestic Korean studies. This article is also a part of a more comprehensive study in this area and can serve as a supplementary modern literature for Russian researchers who major in Korean studies and deal with issues related to the South Korea-US relations. The methodological basis of the study consists of the principle of historicism and approaches such as structural-functional and systematic. The article employs general scientific, general historical and political science research methods. Among the general scientific methods, the author used methods of analysis and synthesis; time comparison method and complex method. Among the general historical methods, the historical-comparative method and the historical-genetic method are applied for demonstrating the causal relationship between political events, and the historical-systematic method for singling out a certain period in the historical process in which the problem is investigated. Finally, among the political science methods, content analysis and event analysis are employed for a better assessment of political events.

AB The article is dedicated to the results of thirty years activity of the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission of the Council of Europe), which is a recognized expert center in the field of constitutional law. Russia has been participating in its work since 2002. The purpose of the article is to show the evolution of the VC expert opinions' problematics from the general problems of constitutional reforms to the specification of individual institutions, the assessment of electoral systems, the effectiveness of justice, guarantees of civil and political rights of citizens. This comparative analysis contributes to a better understanding of the Commission's current activities. The main stages of the Commissions' formation are considered. The authors explore the expansion of the geographical sphere of Venice Commission's influence and the strengthening of its role in the political-legal and scientific-legal fields. The conducted research makes it possible to fill an obvious gap in the domestic science of comparative and constitutional law, since there are only a few special works dedicated to the Venice Commission. The article sets out tasks that can contribute to the shaping of new directions for the development of legal science, taking into account the experience of the Commission and its contribution to the improvement of democratic institutions. The work is intended for scientists specializing in comparative and constitutional law, teachers and students studying the law of the Council of Europe. An optional seminar on the legal positions of the Venice Commission was organized at the Master's program of the Institute of Legislation and Comparative Law under the Government of the Russian Federation.

TI President Moon Jae-in's Policy on the Settlement of the Inter-Korean
   Relations: Searching for a Balance between the Desirable and the
   Possible
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE inter-Korean relations; politics of Moon Jae-in; inter-Korean summits;
   denuclearization; Korean Peninsula
AB Moon Jae-in came to power in May 2017 in the wake of the Korean political crisis and impeachment of the previous president Park Geyn-hye. Since the very first days of his leadership President Moon has set a course for a sequential transformation of the inter-Korean relations and prevention of the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula. The cornerstone of his program was the idea that the denuclearization of North Korea and the establishment of the long-lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula is possible provided that the North-South relations are normalized and Pyongyang is involved into the constructive peaceful dialogue. The authors demonstrate how Moon Jae-in was able to start the renaissance in the inter-Koran relations. He used the experience of the previous liberal governments of the Republic of Korea and successfully developed and enhanced the famous Sunshine Policy with his own ideas. The first stage of Moon Jane-in's presidency was marked with some serious foreign policy achievements. Thanks to the tactic of "summit diplomacy" President Moon was able to achieve significant reduction in tensions on the Korean Peninsula, which resulted in the fact that relations between the North and the South became more friendly and trustworthy. The historical documents signed during these summits - the Panmunjom Declaration (April 2018) and the Comprehensive Military Agreement (September 2018) - and their fast practical implementation can also be considered as President Moon's success. Further advancement of Moon Jae-in's course for building positive relationships with the DPRK faced serious obstruction from the United States. The authors show how simultaneously with settlement of inter-Korean relations President Moon had to deal with another difficult task - neutralization of the external factors (US sanctions and disagreements between Washington and Pyongyang) that were harmful for the development of the North Korea-South Korea relations. The tactics of being a mediator between the United States and North Korea chosen by Moon Jae-in was quite efficient in the beginning. The blatant enemies - Pyongyang and Washington - clamped down on their confrontation and sat at the negotiating table. However, the intransigence of Washington on the issue of a gradual and phase-based denuclearization of North Korea and withdrawal of sanctions altogether with the non-constructive criticism of the South Korean opposition made Moon Jae-in a hostage of the situation, limiting his potentially independent and substantive steps in foreign policy. Meanwhile, the authors of the research have come to the conclusion that on some issues President Moon was able to achieve much more than his predecessors. Despite the fact that he was unable to achieve a full-scaled settlement of the inter-Korean relations he did everything possible under the existing circumstances. Nowadays one can say that the challenges of the North Korean nuclear missile program and security on the Korean Peninsula are no longer entirely military topics, they are even more likely to be diplomatic issues. This fact is undoubtfully his great accomplishment. Thus, it is possible to foresee good perspectives for the further declining level of the regional tensions and for the development of the inter-Korean relations.

AB The urgency of this problem is conditioned by several factors. The need to comprehend the historical continuity and comprehensive presentation of the Tatar social and political movement's efforts after the February Revolution to modernize the traditional Muslim society. Weak development of the problem of teachers' organized movement during the period between the February bourgeois-democratic revolution and the first months of the Bolsheviks' power in Kazan. The need to refer to the origins and experience of Russian education organization to focus on teachers' social role in education quality improvement. The 100th anniversary of the TASSR also makes the topic especially relevant. The purpose of this article is an attempt to elucidate the role and significance of teachers' congresses in the fate of public education of the Muslim Tatars of the Volga-Ural region after the Revolution of February of 1917. The leading method for the study of this problem is a systematic approach and system analysis, which allow considering the teachers' congresses as one of the manifestations of the social development of Tatar society in regional and national events. The article traced the main stages of the movement of Tatar teachers. It concluded that the socio-cultural modernization of the national school, the elimination of national discrimination in school construction and the inclusion of Tatar schools in the state network should be perceived as the result of the social and political movement of the intellectually advanced part of Tatar society.

TI Explaining "How... Politics Actually Work": The German Historian
   Wolfgang Reinhard, the Theory of Verflechtungen and Micropolitics
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Wolfgang Reinhard; Verflechtungstheorie; micropolitics; network
   analysis; patron-client-relationship; informal relationships; social
   history; historiography
AB The conceptualization of the role of informal relationships, including patron-client relations, in the development of Early Modern state institutions in modern European historiography is usually associated with the names of R. Munier, S. Kettering and A. Maczak, whose works have long since become classics. Less well known in this context is the Verflechtungstheorie (lit. theory of entanglement), developed in the 1970s by the Freiburg historian W. Reinhard. The aim of this article is to examine the Verflechtungstheorie in historical perspective and its theoretical foundations, as well as the history of its reception in the context of the development of social history in Germany. In doing so, the author explains the reasons why Reinhard's approach occurred less influential in comparison with the works of the historians mentioned above. The article is based on a detailed study of Reinhard's works dedicated to the Verflechtungstheorie (since the 1990s micropolitics), starting from his 1979 monograph Freunde und Kreaturen ("Friends and Creatures") and ending with the most recent publications in the 2010s. The beginning of the article is devoted to the formation of the conceptual apparatus of Reinhard's theory. He understands the term Verflechtungen as the result and foundation of social interaction based on four relationship types - kinship, compatriot, friendship and patronage, playing, according to Reinhard, a key role in premodern times. The theoretical basis of Reinhard's explanatory model is formed by the sociometry of the American sociologist J. L. Moreno, and Reinhard viewed his concept of elite relations as a kind of network analysis. Further on the article moves on analyzing the reception problem of the presented theory. According to Reinhard, the Verflechtungstheorie experienced reception difficulties within historical scholarship mostly for being technically ahead of its time. However, as the article shows, the main reason was that the concept failed to meet the zeitgeist prevailing in postwar German historiography. While social history developing under the influence of the Bielefeld school focused on the study of microhistorical subjects, Reinhards's approach was mainly a political one. Abandoning the term Verflechtungen in the mid-1990s and replacing it with the term micropolitics, Reinhard did not solve the problem. This change was a merely linguistic one, and Reinhard continued to argue that informal relations mark a negotiable stage, which is characteristic for societies with a high level of mobility and an underdeveloped statehood. In conclusion, the article shows that the results of Reinhard's scholarly work should not be considered a failure. The main merit is its continuity: some of Reinhard`s former students proved that informal relationships are by no means a parasitic atavism associated solely with corruption.

This article, based on the report presented at the General Meeting of the Russian Academy of Sciences on December 8, 2020, focuses on the role of science in solving this new for that time, complex, multifaceted problem. It is emphasized that collaboration between the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Navy has always resulted in effective solutions to problems of developing all types of naval forces, most intensively, submarine forces. The close interaction between scientific structures and the Navy became fully-fledged in the era of the scientific and technological revolution, which began and developed rapidly in the period characterized by confrontation between two opposing military-political blocs-the Soviet Union and the United States.

DE parallel society; immigration policy; Scandinavian states; vulnerable
   residential area; Muslim communities; multicultural society
AB The article analyzes potential and real threats to the national security of the Scandinavian countries from Muslim segregated communities of immigrants who form "parallel" societies on the territory of Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Based on the commonality of the historical development, the economic system and the sociopolitical structure of the states in this geopolitical region, the research identifies general trends in the formation of a confessional parallel society and the modern political immigration strategy in Northern Europe. The study of social and political discourse and officially published documents on the problem of "parallel" societies makes it possible to assess the effectiveness of actions taken by state structures to ensure the full integration of isolated Muslim communities in the majority society. The reports of ministries and internal law enforcement agencies in the states of Northern Europe deserve special attention against the background of the widespread exploitation of the problems of Muslim parallel communities in the media and sociopolitical debates that escalate social tension in the Scandinavian countries. Despite the fact that the official reports emphasize the undeniable relevance of this problem, they exclude the possibility of escalating the current situation into a threat of national or international scale since the police keep these territories under control. However, the lack of successful integration policies of Denmark, Sweden and Norway regarding ethno-religious minorities significantly complicates the legal regulation of cultural, religious and ethnic diversity within their national borders. This situation leads to the formation of "vulnerable residential areas" with a high degree of crime against the background of a low socioeconomic standard of living. The population of such areas mainly consists of non-Western immigrants practicing Islam. Discrimination of the rights of ethno-religious minorities in democratic countries to a large extent determines the tendency to the segregation of Muslim communities from the majority society on the basis of their own cultural and religious order, which subsequently may lead to religious radicalization. Despite the positive measures taken by the governments of Denmark, Sweden and Norway to integrate Muslim minorities into the majority society, the prevailing inefficiency of the existing immigration policy in the context of the continuous expansion of cultural, religious and ethnic diversity among the population of the Scandinavian countries is stated. Moreover, the main reason for the emergence of a confessional parallel society as a modern social phenomenon lies in the practical absence of state structures and public institutions capable to ensure full integration of all citizens into a united society.

DE European Union; common external energy policy; European Commission;
   Energy Union; communitarisation
AB Energy has always been of particular importance to the European Union. Meanwhile, up to the beginning of the 21st century, this area had been in exclusive competence of member states, with timid attempts of the European Commission (EC) to receive part of the powers in the energy sphere. The article is devoted to the issues of the EU common external energy policy development that was accompanied by a dichotomy of interests between the member-states, which hardly like the idea of the energy sector communitarisation, and the European Commission, which has been the main driver of supranationalisation of the energy sphere for a long period of time. The author characterizes the main achievements towards the EU common external energy policy, including the law regarding the export of energy to neighboring non-member countries through various organizations, such as the Energy Community, the Eastern Partnership, MEDREG, and launching of the European Energy Union (EEU) in 2015. Special attention is paid to external factors that facilitated the enhancement of the European Commission's role in the energy sphere. The new era for the EU common external energy policy started in 2015 with the EEU and energy security as one of its priority, partly due to the gas crises and political tension between the European Union and Russia. It is noted that the EEU has facilitated the adoption of some EC's legal proposals that could not be adopted for a long time, such as the mechanism of consultations on new intergovernmental contracts. In general, the creation of the Energy Union should certainly be seen as strengthening the supranational energy competences of the European Commission. It is concluded that the European Commission has made a significant progress towards a common external energy policy, strongly supported by the public opinion that the European Union should speak one voice with third countries. Despite the lack of legally supported competencies in energy for the EC, it gained authority in different directions of the EU energy policy development. Under these circumstances, the common energy market that has led to energy interdependent of the member states, forces them to cooperate at a supranational level. The author argues that third countries should clearly understand the dynamic and processes of communitarisation of the energy sphere and adopt their cooperation with the European Union based on this knowledge.

AB How did Vladimir Putin manage to turn the vociferous political opposition of the 1990s in Russia into a mere statist? I argue that among the wide array of instruments mastered by Putin's regime, the control over the organisational environment stands apart. By regulating the formation and maintenance of the political organisations, the regime was able to divide the opposition into its 'systemic' and 'non-systemic' components. The restrictions on the organisational development set limits to the societal outreach of the opposition. Finally, by manipulating the rules of access to the institutional arenas and resource flows, the regime fostered differential stimuli for the opposition groups that made the coordination among them unlikely. This article suggests that not less than being informational or coercive, the autocracies like Russia under Vladimir Putin have to control the organisational environment in order to keep the opposition at bay.

AB The article discusses the problem of the decline in the spirit of Indian secularism, both in connection with the significant loss of popularity of the INC party and the general crisis of liberal values in the world, examines the reasons for the complication of intercommunal dialogue and the reduction of public space for tolerance. The understanding of such key ideas as secularism, religious tolerance, multiculturalism, pluralism in political culture and society determines not only its prospects on its path to modernization, but also determines the fate of these societies. In addition to the ideological confrontation around the listed concepts within the Indian political system, the study examines the special role of educational institutions at all levels and the media in expanding the space of public dialogue and also outlines the difficulties faced by the country's political institutions. Based on the examples of recent experience in resolving the Kashmir problem and the adoption of the Citizenship Law, an attempt is made to assess the mutual influence of the secular self-awareness of Indians and religious dynamics in a complex structured Indian society on political processes. The paper assesses the impact of the Hindutva ideology on reducing the degree of secularity in modern India and the role of the Sangh Parivar family (Hindu ethno-nationalist organizations) in the course of the country's forced "saffronization" policy.

AB In the presented historical and legal research, the author analyzes the legislation establishing the legal basis for organizing the volost budgets of Siberia during the NEP period, as well as law enforcement materials in this area. The main problem of the study is the lack in science of a unified approach to determining the causes of the permanent deficit of local budgets during the NEP, as well as the failures of the state policy to establish independent budgets at the volost level. The aim of the work is to identify and comprehensively analyze the political and legal processes in the Siberian village, which have a decisive influence on the formation of volost budgets in Siberia during the NEP. The geography of the study is due to the peculiarity of Siberia as a region of the RSFSR, associated with a large area, the development of a financial and economic base, a significant share of agriculture in the structure of the economy, a high degree of centralization of power and, at the same time, inertia of local administrative structures. The study is based on theoretical material, which is works by T.F. Yashchuk, V.A. Ilinykh, V. Danilov, R. Manning, L. Viola, and other researchers of the Soviet period, as well as archival materials presented in the respective funds of the State Archive of Novosibirsk Oblast. The methodological basis of the study was dialectical and historical and legal methods. In particular, the use of the dialectical method contributed to the study of the terms "local budget" and "peasant resistance" in terms of their content. The use of the historical and legal method helped substantiate the role and significance of peasant resistance in the process of forming volost budgets. As a result of the study, the author formulates the conclusion that the lack of positive results in organizing the volost finances of Siberia is associated not so much with economic reasons or incorrect legislative decisions, but with the reaction of the peasantry to the state transformation policy of the Soviet village. Peasant resistance, manifested, in particular, in ignoring the instructions of the central financial authorities, had a decisive effect on law enforcement in establishing a system of local finance at the volost level. The process of organizing large collective forms of farming in the village, accompanied by repression and coercion, entailed active opposition to the state policy by the peasantry, which made it impossible to form a system of volost budgets. It seems that this conclusion can be extrapolated to the entire territory of the RSFSR, since a similar situation developed in almost all regions of the country with developed agriculture throughout the entire period of the NEP.

   humanism
AB The question of the death penalty has repeatedly arisen in Russia and other countries. In 1906, the First State Duma and the State Council of the Russian Empire considered a bill to abolish the death penalty. Nikolai Tagantsev supported the bill. The inexpediency of the death penalty as a form of punishment, statistical data, the specifics of the historical moment and the shortcomings of the Russian judicial system, inconsistency with Christian teachings, and the death penalty's defenders weak reasoning were Tagantsev's arguments. In 1868, the British Parliament considered the proposal to abolish the death penalty. John Stuart Mill supported the exceptional measure of punishment for especially grievous murders. He spoke about the value of human life, the sacredness of human feelings that make up this value, about punishment, the right to life and the grounds for depriving of this right. Mill argued that the alternative to the death penalty in the form of life imprisonment is not in line with considerations of humanism. Aleksandr Kistyakovsky described the approach to solving the death penalty question the British used throughout the 19th century as "philosophical positive". Mill's argument about the inconsistency of life imprisonment with humanism considerations is consistent with modern science, which confirms the extreme degree of gravity and severity of this type of punishment. Tagantsev's opinion primarily reflects the interests of the state. Mill is building his arguments based on philosophical concepts that are close to human beings. Historically, the death penalty evolved from the custom of blood feud, and people used it as a retribution (recognized as just) and punishment for murders. Over time, in Russia, this type of punishment became mainly a means of protecting the state. Mill's position seems to be a more proper approach to addressing the issue of the death penalty as an exceptional measure applied to a person guilty of an especially grievous murder.

AB Modern sociocultural changes are running rapidly, are constantly provoking new requirements that society and labor market impose on a person and his/hers education. As a result, people are largely frustrated with their own expectations and the expectations of society. The value of education increases permanently, and the study of educational practices has become more relevant than ever. In this regard, one of the main challenges that social and human sciences face is the challenge of understanding human nature - this will make educational practices as adaptive as possible, capable of adjusting to this nature, and, possibly, changing it. This issue is deeply reflected by the cognitive scientist Steven Pinker in his book The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature. His main idea is that human nature cannot be understood as a blank slate and must be studied in the context of the evolutionary baggage of humanity. Pinker states that it is impossible to ignore the achievements of the natural sciences, such as neurobiology, in explanation of human behavior as an individual and as a member of society. It should be noted that certain contradictions in the definition of the concept of human nature exist in Pinker's work and in the works of his colleagues. Some researchers understand human nature as a part of the biological world opposed to the human culture or society. Others see it as a collection of properties - biological, social, moral, etc. - that distinguish human beings from other species or objects in the world. As a result, Pinker suggests a definition of human nature, according to which even extreme cases of human nature's "plasticity" reveal important innate limitations. Based on that definition, the following hypothesis can be formulated: in terms of the blank slate theory (social constructivism) and taking into account the evolutionary theory, we can say that a human being is neither a blank slate, nor a sheet with a pre-typed text. Human nature can be compared to a linguistic test, in which information is partly given and partly skipped for sentences to be completed. In relation to educational practices, it means: 1) the necessity of developing core principles of a practice, taking into account the above mentioned innate limitations of human nature; 2) the systematization of these principles in such a way that they adapt to those plastic individual traits which determine the person's ability to assimilate information.

DE social and epistemological examination; computer mathematics;
   mathematical practice
AB The widespread use of computers not only in obtaining or verifying mathematical results, but also as a means of organizing the mathematical community, will allow solving the problem of examining mathematical results and will also significantly change the epistemic characteristics of mathematical knowledge as knowledge generated and verified individually. The emerging mathematical Internet platforms pretend to act as independent structural elements of the "map of mathematical knowledge". They can often act as collective agents of mathematical activity. The creation of libraries of computational mathematics is the creation of unparalleled database structures that organize collective mathematical knowledge in an optimal way (historians of science emphasize the extraordinary importance of the invention of a library catalog for the development of science; it is difficult to imagine the scale of the stimulus for the development of computational mathematics as a result of the creation of such a new organization of mathematical knowledge). The most controversial aspect of computer knowledge, associated with the verification of boundless computer proofs, is also going through an essential stage associated with the development of the theory of univalent foundations. This theory claims to act not only as new foundations of mathematics, but also, due to its formalizability, as the basis of computer mathematics. The transformation of mathematical practice, caused by the introduction of computers both in the organization of the mathematical community and directly in the mathematical practice of obtaining and verifying results, indicates that the very social practice of examining and consolidating mathematical results is undergoing revolutionary changes in its scale. In the sociology of science and technology, a new direction of research is being formed - the social machine - associated with the study of the transformation of social practices on the basis of the emergence of human-computer cooperation in them. In the author's opinion, the development of computer mathematics turns the practice of modern mathematics into a most interesting field of research in this direction due to both the speed of the changes taking place and their scale. The first studies of this kind convincingly demonstrate the depth of the transformation of the accepted social standards of examination and the consolidation of mathematical results in connection with the increasing introduction of the computer into mathematical practice. In the author's opinion, the most intensive changes in the mathematical practice of production and verification of knowledge will be associated with the further development of the program of univalent foundations, which claims to be the foundations of both computational and most of mathematics in general.

   Kolchak; intervention
AB The article reveals the peculiarities of the influence of stereotypes in the images of Britain and France on the process of forming the key ideologemes of the anti-Bolshevik movement in the East of Russia. The choice of images of these countries for research is due to their main role in the Entente, long-term relations with Russia, as well as the close attention of anti-Bolshevik forces and the Siberian and Far Eastern press to these states. The sources for the study were periodicals published in the East of Russia from mid-1918 to the end of 1919 - official newspapers of anti-Bolshevik regimes, Cadet (Constitutional Democratic), Socialist Revolutionary and Menshevik (Social Democratic) publications. The ideas about the peculiarities of the social and political structure of France and Britain, stereotypes in combination with propaganda and journalistic cliches were actualized in the course of communication, the participants of which were the authorities, political parties and the periodical press. On the one hand, this was prompted by the need to construct a number of ideologemes used by governmental structures in propaganda. On the other hand, there was a political struggle between various groups within the anti-Bolshevik camp, part of which was the discussion on the pages of the periodical press. The author comes to the conclusion that the actualization of the images of the British and French as the "significant Other", a role model, was a reflection of the active attempts to form the identity of the anti-Bolshevik movement. Its main components were the ideas of national and civil unity and the revival of Russian statehood. Broadcasting the idea of unity of the nation to the population, the official and party press constructed the image of an ideal citizen - a patriot, conscious and ready to make sacrifices for the preservation and prosperity of the state. Positive images of the British and French were models in its formation. The idea of the revival of statehood was a common thread in the slogans and texts of the anti-Bolshevik newspapers and magazines; it was understood and interpreted differently by various groups. In the images of the allies, "state-minded" ideologues sought the confirmation of the thesis about the need to strengthen the dictatorship in the name of legality and rallying of society and the state for the sake of victory. Meanwhile "revolutionary democracy" addressed the topic of the importance of preserving the people's power and solidarity of the socialist movement of Russia and the West. According to the author of the study, the appeal of the anti-Bolshevik ideologists to the idealized images of the allies against the background of the ambivalent and inconsistent policy of the Entente countries and the abuses of interventionists in Russia itself only negatively affected the stability of the anti-Soviet political regimes.

DE collective historical memory; official memory; conventionality of
   memories; national identity; memory aberrations
AB Collective perceptions of the historical past and their assessment are an integral part of any culture. By transmitting historical experience from generation to generation, collective historical memory is the basis for the formation and preservation of national identity, especially in times of serious social upheavals and transformations. The study of collective historical memory is the focus of modern social and humanitarian knowledge. Despite the fact that the concept "collective historical memory" has thoroughly entered the socio-philosophical and political discourse in the second half of the twentieth century, one can find quite a lot of uncertainties and disagreements related to its content and use. In modern socio-philosophical discourse, there is a skeptical attitude to its use. Some researchers declare this concept a metaphor, a fiction, a meaningless construction, and claim that the concept of collective historical memory has replaced the concept "ideology". According to the author, the concept "collective historical memory" has its own semantic content and essential features, and can be used as an independent concept. As a semantic concept, it does not replace the concept "ideology", it has theoretical and heuristic value. Collective historical memory is the ability of social groups and the nation as a whole to symbolically reconstruct collectively significant historical events in the collective memorization and oblivion, giving them a certain value-based interpretation. According to the author, collective historical memory as a living dynamic system exists according to its own laws, different from individual memory. The most unique laws that require philosophical reflection are: 1) the "delayed memory" syndrome; 2) the conventionality of memories; 3) the specific mechanism of memory distortion; 4) the communicative and generational nature of collective historical memory. An important aspect of understanding collective historical memory should be the problem of manipulation of memory by official ideology, as well as the problem of contradictions and conflicts between memory preserved in families and small social groups and official (public) memory. According to the author, the significant differences between collective historical memory and ideology allow us to show that there was no substitution of concepts in modern discourse, which is explained by the paradigm shift from deideologization to collective memory.

AB Since the beginning of XXI century higher education internationalization trend has been intensifying around the world. The goal of the research is to study managing international education characteristics to promote educational services export. Levels of interconnection and interdependence between economic agents around the world are increasing; transnational forms of economic activity, information and communication technologies are developing. The market for higher education is developing intensively as educational services of the highest international level demand is increasing. The research goal is to analyze the main economic tendencies in modern students' exchange programmes. The problems discussed are the need to increase educational services export by promoting it using various student exchange models, study of managing international education characteristics to promote educational services export and its development. For this purpose the methodology consisting of modeling educational policy processes and analyzing the results is used. The results of the study show that higher education takes on international socio-economic features, which are to be seen as an attractive investment target. Modern higher education is developing in the conditions of open access and mutual influence of conditions in different countries, depending on the basis of economic, political and cultural relations. The growing interest in education abroad leads to existing paradigm of educational services management review thus updating this study's topic. In the conclusion we highlight that integrative processes in internationalization of education management can significantly enrich practical application in this sphere. Recommendations in this study can be used to increase educational services export and import.

DE transcendental intermediary; transcendental epistemology; metaphysical
   ontological tradition; language ontology; reference, Kantian tradition
AB The transcendental intermediary aspect is a core link in analytic philosophers' papers, which enables verifying the ontological metaphysical tendency development in the course of the Kantian epistemological tradition. Up to this moment, the way of the Kantian tradition development in analytic philosophy is undefined. It rejects critical idealism as a term, whereas the transcendental intermediary is accepted to have different meanings. There is a hypothesis concerning multiple tendencies in the Kantian tradition development, perceiving ontological and epistemological items to be separate. The transcendental intermediary rejects a direct cognition of reality. It represents either a phenomenon or a concept. Quine's ontological relativity presents language as the transcendental intermediary, which exerts a link between epistemological and ontological Kantian traditions. In Quine's essays, language ontology, perceived as the transcendental intermediary, is not unique. It is also accepted to be a separate tendency in Kant's tradition, representing methodology and excluding epistemology, in the course of logic and semantics. Peter Strawson's Individuals is not a separate epistemological theory. Its first part is derived from Kantian metaphysics, but the second tends to be a specific research in logic and semantics. Language ontology in Individuals covers several levels. As a whole theory, it comprises metaphysical aspects, those of reality and language grammatical categories representing a new language ontology. Similar to Quine's papers, it mostly covers the logical and semantic essence of language units, as well as the communicative function, which naturally denies epistemological influence. Epistemological and ontological unity as the result of blending is not realized. Neither Quine's categories nor Strawson's universals or particulars represent an epistemological conception. The basic core trend caused by Kant's influence in language philosophy is logical and semantic language ontology, the principle of reference and the relevant categories. The theory of reference is equal to the semantic one, though there is no transcendental semantics affirmed as the philosophical sphere: see Kant's influence upon Austin's theory, which has nothing to do with transcendental epistemology. The transcendental theory in language ontology does not have a wide influence upon analytic philosophy. This matter has been accepted by the sovereign transcendental intermediary, performing the scheme of concepts for analytic philosophers' papers, but it does not influence the mere ontological system. "Transcendentalism" as a term has an uncertain meaning: it specifies Kantian philosophy, represents a complex ontology for objects, synonymous to idealism. There is no precise model of the transcendental epistemological theory equal to Quine's papers. Transcendental ontological autonomy is confirmed by Kantian influence upon the origins of semantics, the category of meaning, the complex language ontology, its referential intentions and equal links between language units, which does nott uncover epistemological origins.

DE "autocracy of the people"; Narodnaya Volya; RSDLP; Lev Tikhomirov;
   Georgi Plekhanov; Vladimir Lenin
AB Speaking about the "autocracy of the people", historians of political ideas first of all recall Jean-Jacques Rousseau with his unforgettable term "peuple souverain" ("le Peuple est seul detenteur de l'autorite souveraine"). Memory resurrects scenes and images with famous figures of the Great French Revolution who tried to bring the idea of the sovereignty of the people (souverainite du peuple) to life. One recalls Maximilian Robespierre with his "I am not the courtier, nor the moderator, nor the tribune nor the defender of the people, I am the people myself" ("Je ne suis ni le courtisan, ni le moderateur, ni le tribun, ni le defenseur du peuple! Je suis peuple moi-meme!"). However, few philosophers of politics and historians of political ideas will recall that once the concept "autocracy of the people" (this is how the expression "souverainite du peuple" began to be translated in the Russian social democratic society) became one of the most important concepts of Narodnaya Volya (People's Will) and once had a powerful influence on RSDLP (Russian Social Democratic Labour Party): it was not only included in the Party's First Program, but was also actively used in Bolshevik political rhetoric. The expression "autocracy of the people" in the years of the First Russian Revolution is used both in the political works of Lenin and Stalin, and in all sorts of leaflets, appeals, calls to the working people. RSDLP takes the expression "autocracy of the people" for its First Program from the literary-political and program documents of Narodnaya Volya. Tracing this conceptual line, we come across such prominent political figures and philosophers as Lev Tikhomirov, Georgi Plekhanov, and Vladimir Lenin. However, of particular interest is the development of the concept in the political thought of Lev Tikhomirov after he ceased revolutionary activities and joined monarchism. At the beginning of the 20th century, in his political philosophy, "autocracy of the people" acquires strongly marked monarchist features while retaining the Russoist revolutionary anti-autocratic content. This, undoubtedly, is extremely rare in the history of political ideas and needs a historical and political analysis. In the humanities, a new direction has been formed - Tikhomirov studies. What was the meaning and influence of Tikhomirov's thought in the political history of Russia? There are rather fierce debates about this, especially in the current situation and context, when monarchism becomes not just an object of study by historians, but also a concept in political struggle. Books, including the diaries of the thinker, are published and analyzed. His life particularly attracts the interest of scholars in various fields. The interest of political scientists is clearly not incidental here.

DE migration; migrants; attitude towards migrants; strategies of
   intercultural interaction
AB The study aims to identify the attitude of the population of Russia and of other European states towards migrants, to determine the strategies of intercultural interaction that are preferable for the host community. The publication is based on a secondary analysis of the materials of a cross-country sociological study, European Values Study (2017). Data for 27 countries were analyzed. The conceptual framework is the complex threat theory, which describes the main components of the perceived threat, leading to prejudice between social groups. To identify the latent variable characterizing the attitude of respondents to migrants, a factor analysis procedure was used. An integrative indicator was calculated that characterizes the attitude of the indigenous population towards migrants. The more the representatives of the host community are convinced of the positive impact of migrants on the development of the country and agree that immigrants are not a source of economic (competition in the labor market, burdening the social security system) and physical (growth in crime) threats, the more positive the attitude towards them is. The study showed that European countries are differentiated depending on the attitudes of the population towards migrants. The revealed differences are due to the action of a set of interrelated factors - the geographic location of the country, the scale of migration flows, the experience of receiving migrants, etc. In Russia, as compared to most European countries, a negative attitude towards migrants is more pronounced. Policies aimed at preserving and developing cultural differences between migrants and the host community do not find wide support among Europeans. Residents of most countries participating in the project see assimilation as a more attractive strategy of intercultural interaction with migrants. At the same time, a significant part of Europeans demonstrate a balanced position, not giving a clear preference for one or another interaction strategy. The attitudes of Russians do not stand out against the general background. A statistically significant correlation was revealed between the positive attitude of the population towards migrants and the respondents' confidence in the benefit to society from newcomers' preserving their customs and traditions. The lack of such confidence determines the choice of an assimilation strategy associated with a negative attitude towards migrants. The revealed correlation is weak in Russia.

AB The internationalization of education is closely related to the political, cultural, economic, and other activities of the country. In addition to other important factors, the soft power of the state can have an impact on foreign students. On the other hand, the system of higher education, along with other components, is itself an important element of the state's soft power. Students from Central Asian countries are the largest group of foreign students in Russia. Nevertheless, Russia has a number of competitors in the region; the competing countries also actively use the soft power tools. According to research works, one of the most effective channels of communication in the international promotion of a university is its website, which makes the analysis of this communication channel highly important, including in terms of the ability to spread the soft power of the state through its higher education system. The aim of the article is to compare the use of university websites as a channel of the "soft power" impact on foreign students from Central Asian countries. The authors of the article conducted a comparative analysis of the websites of universities in Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Turkey, South Korea, and Japan (N=30) with highest positions in international rankings and, accordingly, with the largest number of foreign students. The potential of the university website as a communication channel for attracting foreign students from Central Asia was assessed in terms of soft power. The presentation of information of both academic and non-academic nature was analyzed. Conclusions were drawn on the availability of information on the international environment; on the communication technologies used for spreading the soft power of the state through the higher education system; on the development of sections of the websites which are most important for attracting foreign students in general and from Central Asia in particular; on the quality of information of academic and non-academic nature; on the intention of universities to influence the target group of students from Central Asia through the website; on the quality of the information of academic and non-academic nature in a comparative context.

DE discourse; discourse ethics; Habermas
AB The article considers discourse ethics proposed by Jurgen Habermas, analyzes its logical premises, key points, advantages and disadvantages. The following are distinguished as logical premises: 1) the impossibility to derive the descriptive from the prescriptive, and therefore the inevitable dogmatism of ethical norms; 2) the inability to predict reliably what kind of dogmas will be accepted by other people as convincing; 3) the necessity to discuss moral dogmas in order to clarify them, as well as to test their persuasiveness for oneself and for other people; 4) an understanding of justice as a principle that could be approved by everyone. The virtue of discourse ethics is that it finds a thoughtful, reasoned and elegant way out of post-modern relativism. One of the consequences of this is the possibility to solve the pressing issue of the connection of the classical liberal ideals of freedom and equality with the ideal of brotherhood and solidarity with the help of discourse ethics. The author of the article divides the critique of the ethics of discourse into two directions. The first line of criticism is that the ethics of discourse does not save us from ethical relativism completely. This includes arguments according to which: 1) discourse may lead us to the absence of any universal persuasive rules at all; 2) the rules of discourse according to Habermas are historically relative; 3) it is not exactly clear who will determine the end and the result of discourse, and therefore the practical applicability of the corresponding ethical theory is doubtful. The second line of criticism is related to the fact that Habermas overestimates the role of communication and discourse: 1) the inability to come to an agreement on moral values leads to the fact that the communicative interpretation of justice erases the boundaries between justice and a temporary compromise; 2) Habermas underestimates possibilities and significance of the internal discourse of an individual; 3) the real possibility of opening a discourse for everyone is doubtful. As a result, the author concludes that the flaws in discourse ethics force one to give the principle of discourse a subordinate character compared to the principle of universalization.

DE social philosophy of science; science as good; technoutopia;
   transhumanism
AB The author of the article, proceeding from a number of ideas developed by Ilya Kasavin, attempts to consider a few aspects embedded in the idea of science as a good and, in doing so, focuses on Zoltan Istvan's technoutopia The Transhumanist Wager as an illustration. The author elucidates the main ideological principles underlying Istvan's and Bacon's utopian projects and embracing benefits from science; right reason; true religion (Bacon)/transhumanist ideology (Istvan); a strict choice of "initiated" epistemocrats/scientists; the desire to use science and technology only for the good (Bacon), and utility and commitment to the transhuman worldview (Istvan). The author considers the consistency of the view that regards the Baconian project as a major source of the future transhumanism and the latter - as an inevitable expansion of Bacon's ideas. Such a view has emerged within some transhumanistic approaches represented by Max More, James Hughes, and others, and, in saying so, it goes to extremes. Istvan's futurist project attempts to advance humanity mostly through technology. However, in doing so, it ignores the deep philosophical and humanistic reflection over the very foundations of its program, while some of the missing parts from Bacon's utopia can be traced in his extensive philosophical legacy. Commenting on these inconsistencies, the author, nevertheless, considers it possible to assume that Istvan's technoutopia may arise as a logical and, possibly, route-dependent outcome of the Western European project of science and technology.

   Wittgenstein
AB The article considers whether philosophy deals with the same criteria and the same type of rationality as natural sciences. The research method involves inversion in the spirit of John Langshaw Austin, according to which the meaning of the concept is revealed by analyzing its opposite - in this case, replacing rationality with the concepts of relativism, skepticism and irrationalism. The corresponding concepts in science and philosophy are analyzed by comparing the ideas of the methodologist and historian of science Thomas Kuhn and the philosopher Richard Rorty. It is shown that Kuhn and Rorty are the most interesting figures in this comparison, since Rorty's transfer of the categorical apparatus of Kuhn's concept of the development of science to philosophy proper presents the clearest picture of the "frontal" comparison of relativism (rationality) in "mature sciences" and philosophy. The original problem is to investigate whether philosophy deals with the same criteria and the same type of rationality as natural sciences. Further, it is shown that Kuhn's relativism is an implicit appearance of the skeptical position he took under the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein's skeptical philosophy. Errol Morris initially raised this problem in his recent critical assessment of Kuhn's skepticism, based on the involvement of Saul Kripke, in two independent aspects: 1) the concept of a posteriori necessary truths as a refutation of Kuhn's relitivism, and 2) Kripke's skeptical interpretation of Wittgenstein's late philosophy. The use of the Austin method is quite compatible with the Wittgenstein method, which required philosophy not to explain, but to describe. In this case, the description of the above examples of the relationship between science and philosophy, again the assumed relativism and skepticism, allows a less traditional view of the problem.

DT Article
DE scientific vocation; agent; collaboration; big science; expertise; moral
   heroism; scientific ethos
AB The article provides a number of critical remarks on the thesis of moral heroism as the basis of scientific vocation. The author believes that the image of the scientist presented in the article "Science: A Public Good and a Humanistic Project" by Ilya Kasavin rather corresponds to the image of a philosopher. The author believes that the psychological approach to the conceptualization of scientific vocation is not promising for understanding scientist's agency in the modern big science. The goal-setting of individual researchers can easily be changed, and the boundary striving for truth may not be a motivational determinant at all, giving way to curiosity and joy from communicating with like-minded people. The author claims that moral heroism as a criterion of scientific vocation suggests that scientists should be divided into the selected "knights of truth", whose names remain in history, and the impersonal majority, busy with routine work and technical support of research. It looks like, in accordance with the discussed approach, the latter, since they do not fit the image of a moral hero, do not have scientific vocation at all. The author considers the problem of the definition of a scientist and attribution of authorship in scientific collaborations. In addition, the author notes that the image of a scientist as a moral hero harms the interests of expert examination and the establishment of peer participation of all interested parties in it. The author believes that an alternative to the psychological approach is offered by virtue epistemology: here, the demonstration of epistemic virtues in responsible inquiry becomes a measure of compliance with scientific vocation.

AB This article concerns the problem of science as a public good and the contribution of science to social development. Specifically, it focuses on the possible social benefits of the humanities and social sciences. The article discusses two specific cases from linguistics, in which linguistic knowledge can help to overcome prejudice in society and the harmful social practices associated with it. The discussed cases concern the fight against language prejudices in jurisprudence and judicial practice, and the development of educational programs. The discovery of the truth and objective scientific knowledge potentially beneficial for social development in a certain area are not sufficient for ensuring that this development happens. The popularization of this knowledge in society and demonstration of its use in solving specific problems in the areas external for science turn out to be a separate issue that requires political and social activism and related competencies.

ID XIX; BUREAUCRACY
AB This article tested the facts of the disunity of the socio-political views of local officials at the beginning of the 20th century. It's previously unknown to historical science. Territorial boundaries are defined by Siberia as a remote territory of the Russian Empire, characterized by greater class heterogeneity among civil servants than in European Russia. Thus, the last governor of the Yenisei province, Ya. G. Gololobov, before his appointment to Siberia, was a member of the "Soyuz 17 October party", a deputy of the Third State Duma of the Russian Empire, a hereditary nobleman, but openly opposing conservatism in the system of government. He had many supporters of his ideas in the parliament. The reasons for the formation of his socio-political views were ideological principles, which consisted in the need for changes. On the basis of archival materials, it has been proved that officials in Siberia (natives of the peasant and bourgeois environment) were more susceptible to tendencies characteristic of the oppositional mass consciousness of the early 20th century. For example, the stories of an employee of the notary office of the city of Kansk (M.D. Yudin) and a clerical employee of the Yenisei Provincial Administration (A.F. Ilyushin), who committed crimes against the order of administration, but were not brought to the appropriate legal responsibility for unknown reasons, are shown. The first of them, a peasant by origin M.D. Yudin participated in the shooting at Gorodovoy of the Kansk district police in 1910. M.D. Yudin was sentenced to short-term arrest. He was listed in the police structures as a politically unreliable person. He was involved in revolutionary sabotage; however, he continued his career and in 1916 even served as a notary of the city Kansk. The second, official A.F. Ilyushin was the tradesman of the city of Achinsk. He outraged the state flag of the Russian Empire publicly in 1908. He told slogans of proclamation of the revolutionary events of 1905-1907. He tried unsuccessfully to continue his career in the Tomsk province, but he managed to recover in the staff of the Yenisei provincial administration. Archival data indicate that AF Ilyushin worked in the system of public administration until 1919. The top officials of the Irkutsk Governor-General saw the reasons for the disunity and opposition of political views among officials in the low level of salaries. The statistics presented in the article from the reports of officials of the interdepartmental meeting proves that the remuneration of civil servants does not correspond to the requirements of the time in the conditions of the high cost of the beginning of the 20th century.

AB The article deals with the Soviet theoretical and legal doctrines that have been reflected in dissertations and have a set of specific doctrinal and scientific characteristics. Attention is drawn to the fact that a massive layer of theoretical and legal knowledge known as "Soviet jurisprudence", as well as legal doctrines reflecting the evolution of Soviet law, are currently studied insufficiently both in ontological, epistemological, and praxeological terms: there is no unified position regarding the role, place and significance of Soviet dissertation theoretical and legal doctrines in the literature, there is no unambiguous assessment of the Marxist methodology of legal knowledge, which cannot be consigned to oblivion and should be used in modern educational and scientific space.
   The authors analyze the most important and key dissertations on the theory of law which reflect the essential and methodological foundations of Soviet law, as well as legal doctrines presented in the theses under consideration, which laid the basis and vector for the further development of Soviet theoretical jurisprudence. These dissertation doctrines are studied and analyzed with a view to their further use in the process of scientific research of the laws and trends in the development of Soviet legal thought, while the results are of decisive importance for the history of political and legal doctrines, general theory of law, philosophy of law, but at the same time can be used and in other areas of legal (including industry) science, since they have interdisciplinary heuristic potential.

DT Article
DE social institutions; principles of organization of societies;
   heterarchy; homoarchy; social evolution
ID EGALITARIAN; EVOLUTION
AB Societies are systems composed of a great number of various social institutions that interact and change, which results in that the whole structure of societies changes. This is what social evolution is - the process of structural change. Evolution does not have any particular direction: any significant, that is, transforming change is evolutionary. Along with complexity measured in levels of political integration, societies as systems of social institutions have yet another fundamental characteristic that can be called a 'basic principle of societal organization'. The principle of organization a society embodies depends on the way its institutions relate to one another. Specifically, two basic principles can be distinguished here: heterarchy, whereby elements are unranked or can be ranked in different ways, and its opposite - homoarchy, whereby elements in most contexts are ordered mainly according to one principal hierarchical relationship. Homoarchy and heterarchy represent most universal, 'pure' (generalized) principles and basic trajectories of socio-cultural organization. There are no universal evolutionary stages: cultures can be (generally) heterarchical or homoarchical and have an equal level of complexity. A culture can change its basic organizational principle without changing its current complexity level. There also exist alternatives within each of the two types. The heterarchy - homoarchy dichotomy runs throughout the whole of human history: it is observable on all levels of social complexity in all historical periods and culture areas, including the globalized world of our time. Transformations in the ways social institutions and complexes thereof, that is, societal subsystems, are ranked (either homoarchically or hetrarchically), on the one hand, and changes in culture complexity overall, on the other, are two different, largely unrelated processes. The heterarchy - homoarchy dichotomy has, to a considerable degree, predetermined the non-linear and non-fixed nature of the global sociocultural process. An adequate understanding of human socio-cultural history does not appear possible unless one takes into consideration the possibility of alternative basic principles of societal organization, their complementary and competitive co-existence, and their interrelated dynamics throughout human history. Also, considering this possibility enables discussion of the future of the present-day globalized world as not fixed but variable, where homoarchical and heterarchical principles may intersect in various ways and at different levels - national, international, and transnational.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE charismatic leadership; charisma and law; new Catholic movements; the
   Catholic Church in the XX century
AB The article analyzes the ideas of charismatic leadership developed in the Catholic Church in the second half of the 20th century. These ideas are connected, on the one hand, with the biblical revival, with the attempts to rediscover the heritage of the Church of the first centuries, and on the other hand, with new social phenomena, which are typical for the era after the Second World War. The social dimension of charisma and its role in the creation of associations were rediscovered in Catholicism during the Second Vatican Council. At the same time, a huge number of new social and evangelical initiatives appealing to charisma appeared. The new church movements became the most prominent and well-known examples of catholic "charismatic associations". The author shows how the Catholic hierarchy managed to streamline and incorporate the charismatic leadership of lay associations into the reality of the universal church structure. The article emphasizes that the concept of charismatic leadership in the Church is in the process of evolution. The author concludes that the documents of church governance, proclaiming the absence of a conflict between charisma and institution in theory, reflect the political processes of the contemporary Catholic era: the emergence of Catholic movements with a predominant role of laity, the change of generations of Catholic elites and the formation of a new balance of responsibility between movements and the church hierarchy.

AB The first wave of the civil war in Libya, which ended after the assassination of Muammar Qaddafi in the fall of 2011, did not put an end to the civil conflict in the country. It is shown that in many respects the second wave of the civil war in Libya (the beginning of the active phase of which can be dated May 16, 2014) was a direct continuation of the first wave (February-October 2011). By 2014, it became clear that the Libyan crisis could not be resolved solely through a change in political regime. The revolutionary processes in the case of Libya proved to be fatal for the entire political system, marking the almost complete dismantling of state institutions. Thus, the overthrow of the dictator in Libya did not ultimately solve anything, and the military-political forces that fought in the first wave of civil conflict against Muammar Qaddafi launched an open full-scale armed struggle with each other in May 2014, marking the beginning of the second wave of civil war. This article analyzes the logic and course of the second wave of the civil war in Libya, as well as explores the genesis of key military and political forces in Libya after 2011. The authors conclude that at present time a stalemate has developed in the country. And the impossibility of a military victory for either side of the Libyan conflict allows us to hope for a new agreement between all its parties.

   electoral process; electoral geography; turnout; voting
AB The article contains an analysis of the impact of the crisis situation on the electoral behavior during the national elections in Ukraine. For this purpose, the study highlights the pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis periods. The criteria for a comparative analysis of the electoral behaviour during these periods are the peculiarities of territorial differentiation of voting and the degree of support for election participants, as well as the specifics of the turnout in the regions of Ukraine. It has been revealed that with the transition from one period to another there has been a transformation of the electoral behaviour of voters. The pre-crisis period was characterized by a significant electoral split in Ukraine between pro-Russian and pro-Western forces. The sharp decline in voter turnout in the South-East of the country during the crisis period led to a significant fall in the influence of the pro-Russian forces. In the western regions of Ukraine, on the contrary, during this period there was an increase in voter activity, which determined the emergence of new relevant political forces of a pro-Western nature. In the post-crisis period, turnout rates generally returned to pre-crisis levels. However, this did not lead to a full restoration of the electoral division of the country due to the geographically homogeneous support of V.A. Zelensky and his party << Servant of the People >>. A forecast is made, including three scenarios of transformation of the political system of Ukraine taking into account possible changes in the electoral behavior of voters.

DE migration; Latin America; Europe; Spain; transatlantic mobility
AB The migration ties between Latin America and Europe at the beginning of the XXI century were manifested in a massive migration flow, resulting in the dramatic growth of the number of South American natives in Europe. The Migratory Space concept is applied to the current stage of transatlantic mobility, which makes it possible to determine the territorial limits of the involved states, to distinguish the transatlantic space from the general panorama of the Latin America migration movement as well as from the European migration context. At the present stage, the South American states are mainly the migration donors, while the European states are recipients. The historical ties between continents, their linguistic commonality and the social networks between migrants contributed to the transatlantic mobility. The majerity of the Latin American migrants is localized in Spain and Italy. The high degree of integration into the host communities contributed to generally favorable public opinion about the migrants in the recipient countries. A large-scale migration presence also became an important factor in strengthening economic and political ties in the Iberoamerican Community of Nations.

AB The culture of the Czech National Revival produced a symbolic autoidentification in figures of the Plowman and the Music. The drawings of J. Manes and the sculptures of J. Myslbek perpetuated these figures as gender symbols of the Czech identity. The figures of the Plowman and the Music are presented in the Manes' drawing "Domov". The semantics of the drawing is versatile, which provides an impulse for its culturological interpretation. A symbolic figure of the Plowman in historical and cultural consciousness of Czechs has been associated with Premysl the Ploughman - the legendary founder of the Premyslid dynasty. According to the Czech legend told by Cosmas of Prague, Premysl was elected the prince upon the request by the Czech ruler Libuse, who then married him. The title of the drawing refers to the song of J. K. Tyl, which had become somewhat of an unofficial Czech anthem of the 19th century. In the Manes' drawing Libuse is substituted by a symbolic figure of the Music as a personification of the national genius of Czechs. Historical-patriotic connotations generate the image of the Czech people, which formed in the epoch of the National Revival. Moreover, the Czech identity manifested itself in gender as a harmony of the male and female principles, work, and music. The idea of organic work as the basis of art is introduced into the drawing's composition. A series of Manes' drawings "The Music" came to be a vivid embodiment of the national identity, showing the life of a peasant accompanied by music from birth till death. The Myslbek's sculpture "The Music", which became lobby's centerpiece of a new Czech sacred place - The National Theater in Prague, is presented as a personification of the Czech identity in culture. A female image of the Music is identified with the soul of the people in a state of sociocultural and political emancipation.

AB The article aims at identifying the characteristics shared by the right-wing populist civil movements of Western Europe and the USA and evaluating the possibility to use them for researching right-wing nationalist organizations in Russia. The movements selected for the comparison range from party-like electoral actors to unorganized protesters. They include as follows: The Five-star Movement (Italy), PEGIDA and the like (Germany), the English Defence League (the UK), the Tea Party Movement (the US). The authors identified several interrelated characteristics shared by these movements: (1) dealing with local, usually social, issues, (2) network-like structure of autonomous local groups building the agenda from below, (3) ideological ambivalence leading to replacing ideology with subculture, (4) digitalization of activism. Although in Russia there are no civic movements structurally or functionally identical to Western right-wing populists, the authors demonstrate that local social issues and civic responsibility have become important topics for some Russian nationalists (right-wing radicals) since the mid-2000s. The trends of deideologization and dealing with non-political local issues are researched mainly on the example of the "Frontier of the North" (Komi Republic). The authors conclude that some of the radical Russian nationalists are gradually declining their own independent agenda, following local protests instead. This opens up the possibility for right-wing organizations to become local civil society institutions and to participate successfully in local elections, similar to the "electoral break-through" of right-wing populists in the West. Although it is too early to speak about the deideologization of Russian nationalism, the article suggests that some nationalists are ready to mitigate ideological tensions to secure expanded social support. At the moment, nationalist organizations in Russia remain frozen between right-wing radicalism and emulating Western right-wing populism.

AB The results of studying the attitude of the population to the confidentiality of personal data on the Internet are presented. In empirical terms, this article is based on a representative survey of the Moscow population of May-June 2020. It is recorded that the practice of presenting personal information when using various Internet services has become widespread. At the same time, two-thirds of the respondents expressed concerns about the security of personal information on the Internet. According to a binary regression model, the strongest predictors of this anxiety correlate with the prevailing privacy attitudes among respondents, practices of leaving personal information on the network (primarily about one's children), negative assessments of security provision as a norm of life in a democratic society, and general dissatisfaction with the functioning of the political system.

TI Soviet Aid to the Spanish Republic in 1936-1939: Modern Conservative

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Spanish Republic; Civil War; Soviet aid; conservative versions
AB The subject of the study is some modern conservative versions of the history of the Soviet Union's military assistance to the Spanish Republic in 1936-1939. The aim of the article is to attempt a critical analysis of the new and revived versions of the motives of Soviet intervention in the Spanish conflict, of the involvement of the Soviet leadership in large-scale terror against civilians in the republican zone, of the degree of influence of the Soviet leadership and Soviet representatives in Spain on the governmental structure of the Spanish Republic, of the anti-fascist character of the war. The study has established the inconsistency of the versions about Soviet aid as a means of promoting the world revolution in Spain and as an attempt to draw the democratic and fascist states into a major war between themselves through the Spanish conflict, about the possibilities of Stalin in 1936 to manipulate the great powers. It has been proved that conservative historians exaggerate the degree of influence of Stalin and Soviet political representatives in Spain on the military-political leadership of the republic. The impact of the so-called "instruments" of Soviet influence in the Spanish Republic is also exaggerated. The first of the instruments is considered to be the relocation of part of the gold reserve to Moscow, which, allegedly, allowed the Soviet control over the finances of the republic to be established. The second is the activities of Soviet military advisers; the third is the Communist Party of Spain, which was part of the Comintern, and was considered as an obedient tool in the hands of Moscow. It was and still is traditional to attribute responsibility for unleashing large-scale terror against civilians in the republican zone to Stalin, which does not correspond to reality as convincingly proved by the British historian P. Preston in his famous work The Spanish Holocaust. The scale of terror was exaggerated in the republican zone and, accordingly, understated in the Francoist zone. The study shows the failure of attempts to distort the anti-fascist nature of the war waged by the Spanish Republic relying on the support of the Soviet Union, Mexico, the progressive public of most civilized countries of that time, as well as attempts to present the regimes of Hitler, Mussolini and Franco in 1936-1939 as quite respectable. The new and updated critical versions of the Soviet aid to the Spanish Republic considered in the article are the result of the neoconservative wave in western historiography, which influenced representatives of both the classical historical school and the adherents of postmodernism.

AB The article-review is an analysis of the book by a major Finnish researcher H. Meinander about the life and work of the most prominent military and political figure of Finland, Gustav Mannerheim. Following the author, the reviewer goes through the milestones of Mannerheim's life, analyzing both the convincing and the controversial statements of the historian. The book is written on the basis of various sources and contains polemics with other authors who were engaged in the same subject. The author strove for objectivity, neither embellishing the thoughts and actions of his hero, nor detracting from their meaning and significance, and in many ways achieved his goal. The monograph is divided into chapters that characterize particular periods in Mannerheim's life and consist of separate thematic sections-essays. The result is a dynamically developing picture of the formation of the hero's personality against the background of the most important events in the history of the world, Finland and Russia. The author traces how one of the most important European politicians, who has learned the contradictory experience of the history of the twentieth century, grows out of an aristocrat and a dandy officer. Central to the narrative is the theme "Mannerheim and Russia". Conscientious military service in the Russian Empire, the struggle with Soviet Russia, and, finally, the realization of the need to look for ways to form peaceful relations with a powerful neighbor - this is the evolution of Mannerheim's attitude to our country. A lot of space is also devoted to the problem of Finland's relations with other countries - Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom. "The lessons of Mannerheim", as they are presented in the book, will be useful for the current and future generations of Finnish and Russian political scientists and political practitioners.

TI The "Abrahamic Metacivilization" of the 8th-13th Centuries
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Middle Ages; Abrahamic religions; world-system; civilization; ideology
AB The article substantiates the expediency of considering the system of Christian and Islamic medieval civilizations as a single Abrahamic metacivilization. Heuristic possibilities of the term are revealed on the basis of research works on sociology, philosophy, world and domestic history. The features of the perception of civilizations and religions are analyzed from the point of view of the world-system perspective and global history. The definition of local civilization is being clarified. The definition of metacivilization is given. It is noted that, since the 8th century, on the territory of Asia Minor, North Africa and Europe, a system was forming whose unity was based on a combination of two universal cultures: the Hellenistic (science and law) one and the system of teachings of the Abrahamic religions. The expediency of designating this system as "Abrahamic metacivilization" is substantiated. It could not have arisen before the 7th-8th centuries. Along with the Arab conquests, the importance of religions in communications in the designated territories was growing, and the zone of influence of the Abrahamic religions was seriously expanding. The author proposes to leave open the question of the upper chronological framework of the phenomenon. The Abrahamic metacivilization disappears either in the 13th century (when its Hellenistic component begins to erode) or in the 15th century (with the formation of the capitalist world-system). Like world-systems, the Abrahamic civilization had a hierarchical structure, which depended on the degree of political power centralization and the completeness of the state ideology formation. The metacivilization center was represented by Byzantium and the empires of Islam. It seems promising to use the term to study some aspects of the legal, cultural, social and economic history of medieval states with an official Abrahamic religion, including the study of interfaith transactions. It seems promising to study from such positions the early history of Eastern Europe, whose many regions still preserved the tribal structure. The possibility of using the term "Abrahamic metacivilization" in historical ethnography (for example, based on some provisions of R. Redfield's theory, in which the mechanisms of globalization and global processes were for the first time considered from the standpoint of social anthropology) is also substantiated. An advantage of the term is its specific territorial-chronological reference. It is noted that the term "Abrahamic metacivilization" can be used in studies with different methodological bases.

The leading role of scientists from academic institutions in collecting information about the culture, language, and anthropology of this ethnic group is noted. The Soviet scientific school focused on the problems of the race and ethnogenesis of the Ainu community. With the growth of political tension during the period of late Stalinism, scientific materials about the Ainu fell into the category of secret. In this regard, many of the photographs, field records, and reports collected in those years, as well as data from the Ainu census, were removed from the archives and still remain inaccessible. Political challenges have significantly limited the implementation of plans and the thematic diversity of studies. The surviving archival manuscripts must be introduced into scientific circulation.

AB The article examines the factors that eroded the authority of the royal court of Juan Carlos I which is a key institution in the Spanish governance system. Juan Carlos is regarded for his patriotic stance during the transition from dictatorship to democracy and his pivotal role in the suppression of the military coup of February 23, 1981. Political pluralism and democratism also contributed to the authority of Juan Carlos. For many years, monarchy has been perceived as a guardian of stability in the country and was acceptable even to millions of republican-minded citizens. The author tracks how the Spanish public opinion turned away from Juan Carlos after the disclosure of illegal financial transactions and ugly details of his private life. The King was forced to abdicate and transfer the power to his son Felipe.

TI "UNIPOLAR ASIA": CHINESE REGIONAL ORDER

   Initiative"; center and periphery; great powers; peripheral diplomacy of
   the PRC
AB In recent years, the PRC was considered to be the main revisionist power in the world, challenging the leadership of the United States. The rivalry between the two countries in various fields was the subject of close attention of both politicians and scientists. Depending on how this rivalry would end, forecasts were made about the future of the system of international relations. Today it has become obvious that an equally serious challenge to the existing international order is posed by the economic and political crisis of the Western world, which cannot be overcome in the foreseeable future. The question of what kind of international order can replace the current one is gradually moving from a theoretical level to a practical one. As a rule, it is pointed out the multipolar nature of the coming world political order, but how this fundamentally new structure will function in practice remains unclear. The article emphasizes the following questions: What are the characteristics of the Chinese version of the multipolarity, does it have historical analogs, what are traditional Chinese ideas about the world structure and China's interaction with neighbors, it also argues how useful they can be in contemporary world, in the formation of a new world and regional order. The focus is on China's relations with neighboring powers, with developing countries and great powers, primarily the United States, as well as the problem of combining world-building functions and international order, which is embodied in Xi Jinping's concept "Community of common destiny of mankind" and particularly in the Belt and Road Initiative. As a result of its practical implementation, for the first time in world history, two traditions can claim to regulate global relations - Western and Eastern, reflecting different ideas about the world order and organization of international community and having their own ideas about justice.

DT Article

   Left Party; Green Party; AfD
AB This article is devoted to the changes of the party system of Germany. In recent years, the transformation of the party system has caused several political crises. Party spectrum is pluralized and polarized in Germany. Regional differences also increase. In this situation, the German parties are in search of new dynamics. The consequence of this is that all the main parties are now factional. The system that existed in Germany for more than half a century, with the dominance of two political forces (CDU/CSU and SPD), gradually evolved into the "one and a half" party system (only CDU/CSU dominates). The question is whether evolution will continue towards simple multi-party system, or the "one and a half" party system will remain. With a significant degree of certainty, one can say that a return to a "two and a half" party system is impossible. Changes in the party-political system lead to an increase in the diversity of the composition of the coalitions ruling in Germany. German political parties should learn how to create coalitions of three political forces, also at the federal level. The main trend of the coming years for CDU, CSU and SPD will be an attempt to return to their traditional platforms. However, a full return is impossible. More frequent red-red-green coalitions can be expected, including the federal level. But, nevertheless, serious changes in the German party system did not lead to its chronic incapacity - the system adapted to them.

AB The article explores the position of the Zemstvo liberal party of northern Ukraine on the "Jewish question" in the Russian Empire in the 1880s. Based on little-known historical sources, the author reconstructs the public landscape in the north of Left-Bank Ukraine, where vivid discussions of the "Jewish problem" unfolded. A comparative analysis of the positions of the liberal and conservative Zemstvo circles demonstrated the main initiatives of the progressive Zemstvo, which fundamentally separated the aristocratic opposition fronda from the loyal authorities of the zemstvo environment. A detailed analysis of the primary sources shows that the liberal Zemstvo members strongly opposed the reactionary proposals of the conservatives - including a decisive rejection of punitive measures, the elimination of the civil inequality of the Jewish people in the Russian Empire, a fundamental change in state economic policy with the aim of comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms of social relations in the province, and a search for the harmonization of moral and spiritual relations in society. The publication examined the personal contribution of liberal Zemstvo party members of the Northern Left Bank to the development of a political philosophy for resolving the "Jewish problem" in the country, at the level of journalism of national importance, and at the level of the activities of the Chernihiv provincial commission on the "Jewish question." The author demonstrates that the representatives of the Zemstvo opposition publicly opposed the slightest discrimination and restriction of civil rights and freedoms of Jews, considering such discrimination as manifestations of anti-Semitism and an insult of the Jewish people. The liberal party's reform plan for the conceptual solution of the "Jewish question" in the Russian Empire was an integral organic component of the broad socio-economic and ethno-political doctrine of state modernization.

AB The authors of this contribution analyze the circumstances and the history of a popular play that was staged in the Soviet Union in 1927-1928. Titled 'Jumah Masjid', this play was devoted to the anti-colonial movement in India. A manuscript of the play, not indicating its title and the name of its author, was found in the St. Petersburg Branch of the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences among the papers related to A.M. and L.A. Meerwarth, members of the First Russian Expedition to Ceylon and India (1914-1918). Later on, two copies of this play under the title 'The Jumah Masjid' were found in the Russian Archive of Literature and Art and in the Museum of the Tovstonogov Grand Drama Theatre. The authors of this article use archival and published sources to analyze the reasons for writing and staging the play. They consider the image of India as portrayed by a Soviet playwright in conjunction with Indologists that served as consultants, and as seen by theater critics and by the audience (according to what the press reflected). Arguably, the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution in Russia in 1927 and the VI Congress of the Communist International (Comintern) in 1928 encouraged writing and staging the play. The detailed picture of the anti-colonial struggle in India that the play offered suggests that professional Indologists were consulted. At the same time the play is critical of the non-violent opposition encouraged by Mahatma Gandhi as well as the Indian National Congress and its political wing known as the Swaraj Party. The research demonstrates that the author of the play was G.S. Venetsianov, and his Indologist consultants were Alexander and Liudmila Meerwarth.

AB This article is dedicated to three interconnected concepts - "collective goods", "free rider" and "hegemony" in the context of modern politics. We analyze three theoretical approaches to the problem of provision of collective goods by hegemonic states. These approaches are: neoliberal, (neo) realist and World-System Theory. Basing on these theoretical premises, we analyze the debate about free-ridng in the Western political discourse (especially among US allies) and we point out that particular interests of US can be disguised as "collective goods". Basing on this, we analyze discussions about free-riding both in the Western world (among NATO and EU members) and among US allies in the Pacific region (Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand). We point out that in fact US can use the concept of collective goods to push their own agenda. Than we move to popular in western political science idea that China is a global free rider - for instance in the sphere of sea lane security and global energy security. Basing on A. Kennedy works, we demonstrate that China in fact does not wish to make western powers pay the costs of collective goods. China is rather afraid that western powers will exploit his resources. This idea is supported with the evidence, gathered during in-depth interview with Chinese diplomats and foreign policy experts. Having said that, paper points out that mentioned cases mark the importance of the concept of trust. Trust is well-studied in the field of behavioral economics, but IR theory doesn`t usually takes the concept of trust into account. Also this paper raises a question about including historical and cultural topics in the theory of international relations. Basing on analysis of different ways to incorporate economic arguments in IR theory, authors point out that modern IR theory lacks economic argumentation. Paper concludes with the idea that IR theory should capitalize on behavioral economics.

   liberal reforms of the 1860-1870a; education; judicial system; legal

AB Based on an analysis of archival documents and periodical press materials, the present paper studies the impact of the liberal reforms of Alexander II on the policies of the imperial authorities for the nomadic peoples of the steppe of Ciscaucasia: the Kalmyks, Nogais and Turkmens. The liberal reforms of the 1860s and 1870s had a direct impact on the formation of the national intelligentsia, which during the revolutionary events of the early 20th century led to the rise of the national movement in the empire's peripheries and to the struggle for self-determination of the non-Russian populations during the Russian Revolution of 1917. The article reconstructs individual facts and events from the life of the nomadic population under specific socio-economic and political-legal conditions. Using the historical-genetic method, the influence of liberal reforms on the vital activity of the nomadic peoples of the Stavropol province is revealed. The authors focus on the activities of regional authorities during the period under review, which were liberal in nature and carried out in the context of the reforms of Alexander II. The authors conclude that the pre-Caucasus steppe, the territory of the nomadic Kalmyks, Nogais and Turkmens, being the national edge of the Russian Empire and falling under a special system of governance related to the ethnic and religious characteristics of the populations, was not drawn into the orbit of liberal reforms. Meanwhile, a number of measures were approved by the regional executive authorities on the ground, of course, first of all, aimed at satisfying the needs of the imperial policy for incorporating the region into the common imperial space, but at the same time improving the lives of the nomadic peoples of the Stavropol province, in particular in the field of education and legal procedures.

TI "Amur Region Is Not Siberia": Representation of Differences between
   Siberia and the Far East in the Reports of GovernorGenerals in the
   Second Half of the 19th Century
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Siberia; Far East; governor-generals; reports, images of regions
AB This article aims to show the dynamics of the representation of differences between Siberia and the Far East in the vsepoddanneyshie reports of the governor-generals of Eastern Siberia and of Amur Oblast in the second half of the 19th century, and to define factors that enabled this dynamics. The article is based on the annual reports of Governor-Generals of Eastern Siberia N.N. Muraviev, M.S. Korsakov, N.P. Sinelnikov, P.A. Frederiks, D.G. Anuchin, and A.P. Ignatiev, and Governor-Generals of Amur Oblast A.N. Korf, S.M. Dukhovsky, and N.I. Grodekov. According to the conducted research, the authors infer that the governorgenerals' reports allow reconstructing the place of the Far Eastern territories on the mental maps of the top officials of the regions. Opinions of the governor-generals depended on various circumstances. First, they depended on the symbolic meaning the officials gave to the "Far Eastern acquisitions of the empire" and on their mindsets. In Muraviev's and Korsakov's social imagination the territories were given a distinctive status and viewed as a space for a social experiment in which the old regime based on serfdom and bearing anachronisms of traditional society was to give way to a civil society with a developed local self-governance and a fair judicial system. However, Sinelnikov, Frederiks and Anuchin saw the territories that later were included into Amur GovernorateGeneral as a part of Eastern Siberia, its eastern border, although the area had a specific geographic location, a different climate, a late inclusion into the empire, a different system of territorial governing, and a distinctive social structure. Second, the opinions of the governor-generals depended on the specifics of vsepoddanneyshie reports as a certain type of documents. It is known that vsepoddanneyshie reports were intended for the monarch and for his ministers. As historians have frequently mentioned, reports by governor-generals and governors were an important channel of information, a means of direct communication between the center and the periphery of the empire. Governor-generals were representatives of the imperial center in the regions and, simultaneously, were spokesmen for local interests. Third, the governors' opinions depended on their knowledge and understanding of Amur Oblast and their attitude to the region's inclusion into the empire. Even when the governor-general did not share the idea of an administrative separation of Amur Oblast from Eastern Siberia, as Sinelnikov did, but happened to visit the Far East, he recorded the special conditions of economic development, administrative governance and scope of the population of the most eastern parts of the empire in his reports. Governor-Generals of Eastern Siberia Muraviev-Amursky and Korsakov not only visited Amur Oblast many times but saw the incorporation of the region into the Russian Empire as the goal of their lives. Governor Anuchin, who did not take part in the "Amur saga", saw the region's strategic and geo-political importance.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Political institutions; transit of power; succession of power;
   Uzbekistan; Kazakhstan; post-Soviet space; Central Asia
AB The transit of power is an important and vulnerable stage in the development of political processes for any state. For States with unstable political institutions and a short history of independence, the change of the head of state is an even more serious challenge to stability. In 2016 and 2019, respectively, the two largest Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan launched power transit procedures for the first time in the history of their independence. The transit scenarios differed significantly, despite the common similarity in power structure, political culture, and stage of political development. The more closed political system of Uzbekistan at the time of the death of the first President, Islam Karimov, managed to take a consolidated approach to the choice of a successor and unite for the duration of the transit. In Kazakhstan, on the contrary, after leaving the post of President, Nursultan Nazarbayev remained a key actor in domestic political processes, creating together with his successor, the current head of the Republic, Kasym-Zhomart Tokayev, a bipolar political system that began to contribute to the formation of a split of the political class. One of the reasons for the distinct approaches to transit was the different model of initial capital accumulation after the collapse of the USSR, when large-scale privatization of state property in Kazakhstan created a class of large owners who actively promoted a more open and competitive political system to protect and promote their interests. In contrast to Kazakhstan, the main state property of the Uzbek SSR remained under the control of the state and quasi-state institutions, which slowed down the process of forming a class of owners independent from the state. Separately, each of the transits of power in the post-Soviet space became the object of research, but primarily from the point of view of the development of political systems. A methodological basis of the study was a systemic, comparative analysis of transit of power scenarios considering the politico-economic aspects of the privatization of state property and formation of the proprietary class.

TI Self-Identification of Donbas Residents in the Context of
   Socio-Political Views: A Sociolinguistic Aspect

DE Donbas; Donetsk People's Republic; Luhansk People's Republic; identity;
   self-identification; virtual communities
AB The article is dedicated to the study of self-identification of Donbas residents in the context of identity problems in Ukraine as a whole. The article reflects the results of a pilot sociological survey conducted in the fall of 2020. The obtained data are compared to other public opinion polls related to the issues of identity, socio-political views and ideological preferences of Donbas residents. In addition, this topic was considered using interdisciplinary approach and with the help of ethnolinguistic expert examination based on the speech manifestations of inhabitants of the unrecognized people's republics on the Internet resources. The study of different points of view on identity problems in Donbas on both sides of the conflict showed that the views of researchers majorly coincide. The differences are in the evaluative plane and in the desire to substantiate a certain position. According to the study, a generalized opinion regarding the reasons for what happened in Donbas in 2014 can be formulated as: a sense of alienation, rejection of the change of power in Kyiv and Maidan ideas (nationalism, Nazism, etc.), opposition to the promotion of Ukrainian culture and oppression of the Russian language and culture. A logical continuation was the desire for rapprochement with Russia and annexation following the example of Crimea. The regional identity of a "Donbas resident" remains the most prioritized, and the proportion of those clinging to that identity coincides with other studies conducted on the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. A significant proportion is represented by those who do not expect changes in the status quo of the unrecognized republics in the coming year, which shows the spread of apathy in society. An open question regarding the desired changes demonstrated that about half of respondents expressed aspiration for their land to join Russia. We pay attention to the presence of people (about a sixth part of the respondents) who want integration back into Ukraine, and those who would accept joining either country for the sake of peaceful resolution. The comparison of the survey data with materials from Internet sources shows complete coincidence of the results. Speech manifestations and texts in microblogs reveal the experience of Donbas residents and allow tracing the dynamics of opinions in the course of events. The most popular topic is still rejection of the imposed Ukrainian national identity and strengthening of the regional Donbas one with the development of such a variant of it as "Donetsk/Luhansk Russians". The group of "real" Donetsk residents is isolated on a broad basis of the community of fellow countrypeople, united by cultural, linguistic and ideological priorities. This group has jointly endured the tragedy of war on their land all these years. Appeals to "Moscow" vary in a wide emotional range from expressions of love and gratitude to all sorts of accusations against those Russian officials who do not understand the suffering of Donbas residents.

AB In non-democracies, lawyers face various constraints ranging from the absence of acquittals or violations of their clients' rights to threats and criminal proceedings against them. Yet, we know little about the working conditions of attorneys' in authoritarian regimes, and what influences their desire to remain in the profession. Using a survey of attorneys in Russia, our study demonstrates which factors impact the desire to stay in the profession and how self-legitimacy influences these choices. We find that the frequency of violations of their clients' rights by law enforcement agencies undermines self-legitimacy of attorneys. In turn, this increases the attorneys' willingness to leave the profession, which is mitigated by two factors. First, attorneys with closer contacts with their colleagues in the regional bar associations are less willing to leave the bar for other career options. Second, when such associations actively exclude their members for violations of professional ethics, bona fide attorneys are more willing to stay. Lastly, we find that the expressed desire of leaving the profession transforms into actual voluntary leave in the following year. These findings have important implications, as attorneys do not only defend their clients but can also influence the political regime, either through the mobilisation of law or engaging into collective actions with their colleagues.

AB This article examines a still contentious question: how conservative and liberal elements are combined in Boris N. Chicherin's worldview and political doctrine. It considers several points of view on this issue (expressed by Nikolai Berdyaev, Petr Struve, Georgii Plekhanov, Vasilii Zen'kovskii) and analyzes Chicherin's works of the 1850s-1860s that have provoked the most heated debates. The author attempts to show that assessing the conservative element in Chicherin's worldview is not as straightforward a task as is commonly assumed. His concepts of conservatism and "protective principles" do not fit within broader understandings of conservatism. This article pays particular attention to analyzing the dramatic experience of Chicherin's cooperation with the authorities and the reasons his political position radicalized.

TI An Attempt at Systematic Presentation of the History of Political
   Doctrines in Boris N. Chicherin's Major Work
SO RUSSIAN STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY
LA English
DT Article
DE history of political doctrines; spiritual unity of individuals; organic
   theory of society; Russian philosophy
AB This article examines the classification of political doctrines proposed by Boris N. Chicherin in his major work on the history of political thought. Chicherin uses two forms of systematization for political doctrines: in one, he draws attention to the main element used in explaining society (power, personal freedom, law, or the ideal goal of development); in the other, he refers to the initial level of explanation (rational principles, empirical facts, or a synthesis of the two). This article shows that, despite the great significance of Chicherin's work in Russian philosophy, his proposed model does not correlate well with the real history of political thought and fails to provide an understanding of the general developmental logic of political ideas. The author demonstrates how a more accurate classification of types of political doctrines took shape in mainstream Russian philosophy, expressed in its final form by Semyon L. Frank in his book The Spiritual Foundations of Society. There are two false understandings of society: "singularism," in which society is seen as an external combination of ontologically separate persons, and "universalism," in which individuals are completely subordinated to a single national or universal spirit. Frank calls the accurate approach the "organic theory of society," where the primary ontological unity of individuals is dialectically combined with their secondary, relative autonomy. This article shows that Chicherin's main error in his philosophical analysis of society lies in rejecting this ontological unity of individuals as the basis of public life.

SO NAUCHNYI DIALOG
LA Russian
DT Article
DE legal and political concepts; Catherine II; legal professorship;
   post-reform period
AB The views of Russian lawyers of the second half of the 19th century regarding the political and legal concepts of Catherine II are considered. Attention is paid to educational and scientific works on the history of Russian law and Russian state law, published in the second half of the 19th century. The author proceeds from the fact that professional and class factors influenced the assessment of the empress's political and legal ideas by Russian lawyers. It is shown that the professional one consisted in the official introduction by Catherine II into the Russian political and legal turn of the achievements of European educators, contributing to the formation of a tendency towards the prevalence of the law over the will of the monarch. Particular attention is paid to the fact that most of the representatives of the legal profession were of noble origin, the 18th century was a relatively recent past for them, and family traditions and class identity formed a positive idea of Catherine's rule and the empress herself. At the same time, it is shown that researchers associated with the merchants paid attention to the fact that the empress's selective acquaintance with the works of European thinkers left her without attention to branches of law, for example, civil law, which was of fundamental importance for the estate employed in commerce and industry. The author notes that historians of law paid maximum attention to the state-legal concepts of the empress. It is proved that the conclusions made in the study correlate with the ambiguous assessments of Catherine II both among historians and Russian society as a whole.

ID NORTHERN SEA ROUTE
AB Based on previously unknown archival documents and memoir literature, the article examines the difficulties, achievements and failures in the exploration of the Northern Sea Route by the Soviet Union during the first five-year plans. Using the case-study method, the author focuses on the participation of the steamship "Mossovet" in the navigation of 1937. During the 1937 navigation period the steamship "Mossovet" was to carry out a task of national priority, i.e., for the first time in the Arctic maritime history to make a double through commercial sea trip along the entire Northern Sea Route, sailing from Murmansk to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and backward, finishing in one of European ports.
   The problems which the crew of the steamship "Mossovet" were faced with while implementing its task, largely indicated the entire range of problems relating to the exploration of the Northern Sea Route in the 1930s. The article analyzes the sophisticated complex of natural, technical, administrative and personal factors which did not allow the steamship "Mossovet" to successfully finish the two-way passage. The author arrives at the conclusion that the Soviet exploration of the Northern Sea Route in the 1930s had all the signs typical of big national projects during the industrialization period, namely, unreasonably boosted plans and increased obligations in combination with limited resources, employing political campaigns and a threat of repressions against "sabotage" instead of economic incentives and efficient management methods. Despite the courage and commitment of the ship crews, the striving of the party and state leadership for breaking demonstrative records caused the most serious disruption of work in the Arctic in the period prior to the World War II.

AB The study is dedicated to the emergence of the Russian Arctic politics language which is considered as a set of specific idioms, rhetoric, grammars, and categories. The formation of the Russian Arctic politics language took place during drastic transformations of Russian public and civil political life in the 1860s and 1870s. As any political language, it developed through discussions on political matters: political economy, international relations, and law. Moreover, as every political language, it became an instrument for rationalizing and constructing reality. The rhetoric and pragmatics of the "Russian North protectors", such as manufacturers V.N. Latkin, M.K. Sidorov, public persons V.L. Dolinskiy, D.L. Mordovtsev, and others, are analyzed in the article. Attempting to gain governmental support for their business projects and promoting the position of "state international policy", they developed an alarmist conspiracy method of speech (discourse) about the North of Russia, making themselves closer to the dynamically forming conservative nationalist opposition to the liberal reforms. From that perspective, the "Northern question" was constructed as one of weak points of the liberal government. Idiomatic and speech constructions of the "Russian North protectors" were grounded on the thesis about the threat of alienation of the North of Russia. In the 1860s, this resonated with the moral panic originated from the Polish riots of 1863-1864 concerning the "disruption" of the wholeness of the Russian state, and with the "military anxiety" provoked by the eastern crisis of 1875-1876 in the next decade. The author concludes that the key part in forming the Russian Arctic politics language was played by society, which, however, failed to include the "North question" in the current Russian agenda.

AB The relevance of the presented research is determined by the fact that eschatological premonitions in Russian religious and philosophical thought reveal the future of the problem of good and evil. The problematic of the phenomena of evil, sin and freedom, studied in the context of religious and philosophical discourse, contributes to a more in-depth analysis of the ontological causes of social conflicts and violence phenomena, since it draws our attention to the spiritual and moral phenomenon of free apostasy from spiritual and existential good. The church legal concepts and definitions of evil, sin and freedom, too concentrated on the external ascetic forms of morality, do not give a complete picture and do not reveal the full depth and multidimensionality of this phenomenon. The phenomena of evil, sin and freedom, if they are not reduced only to the manifestations of church normative ethics and the signs that qualify the rejection of its attitudes, are a deep and multifaceted phenomenon of an individual's spiritual and moral life, which has a direct impact on culture and society. Existing in the context of Judeo-Christian discourse, this phenomenon can be characterized not only by external and internal apostasy from traditional spirituality. It often becomes a dangerous and hypocritical form of apostasy from all existential good, love, humanity in general, that is, it acquires a certain global significance. The general directions in the approaches of Russian religious philosophers to the topic of eschatology are revealed. The aim of the work is to show the importance and relevance of spiritual and moral issues, issues of choosing good and evil for deepening modern philosophical discourse in the direction of preventing interreligious and social conflicts, and phenomena of violence, extremism and terrorism. The article examines the problem of evil, sin and freedom in the context of Russian religious and philosophical thought. Various views of Russian religious philosophers on the main issues related to this problem are presented. The spiritual, moral and eschatological aspects of Russian religious and philosophical thought, general directions in the approaches of Russian religious philosophers to the themes of evil, sin and freedom are revealed. The comparability and incomparability of the ideas of Russian religious thinkers with Eastern Christian traditionalism are revealed. Russian religious and philosophical thought came to an understanding of the insolubility of the problem of evil not only in the context of the church ascetic world outlook; it thoroughly confirmed the necessity and importance of a person's spiritual and moral life. The eschatological direction of Russian religious and philosophical thought is mainly correlated with the Eastern Christian cultural tradition and is focused on understanding the universal problems of the fate of the world and man, salvation and death, life and death, good and evil. Having found itself outside the church-legal, religious-philosophical understanding, this phenomenon acquired large-scale development prospects, rebelling against the spiritual and moral foundations of human life. It has become not only an external, but also an internal characteristic of a person. This is confirmed by the extraordinary development of the phenomena of violence, extremism and terrorism. These processes again turn our attention not to the external forms of evil, but to its deepest essence.
   Hence, it becomes necessary to transfer the analysis of the problems of evil, sin and freedom from the church-legal, cultural-historical and prophetic sphere to the spiritual, moral and ethical sphere.

The deficit of the overarching conceptual understanding and concrete results is arguably due to researchers' aspiration to solve a problem in the empirical way, without attempting to combine data analysis with mathematical and computational modeling.
   Having analyzed the existing models on the topic, the authors offer their own model that is based on the spiral-of-silence theory. The key features of the model that set it apart from the existing ones are the following: a) taking into account differences in the types of motivation and costs associated with expressing protest and loyalist sentiments; b) including "partner effect" into the spiral-of-silence mechanism; c) employing a neurological decision-making scheme according to which the same stimulus can prompt action and be a deterrent.
   On the basis of a series of computational experiments with the model, the authors demonstrate that bots are more effective in mobilizing opposition members when an individual motivated for political participation refrains from it because his local social community does not share his views. In this case, the emergence of a like-minded partner bot can destroy the spiral of silence created by this community and encourage this individual to openly express his position. On the contrary, when mobilizing loyalists, bots are most effective in relation to poorly motivated individuals. The model elaborated by the authors not only allows us to evaluate bots' effects in a new way, but it also sheds light on how people make decisions in the framework of political communication and mobilization in social networks.

AB One of the most important sources on the history of Russian academic historical science in general and on the history of Russian Oriental studies in particular is the correspondence between the largest researchers of the history of the Near and Middle East, Academician Vasily Bartold and the permanent secretary of the IAS (RAS/AS of the USSR) in 1904-1929 Academician Sergei Oldenburg. The correspondence is kept in the St. Petersburg branch of the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The documents themselves have not yet been published, and their commented introduction into scientific circulation is only expected. The documents contain detailed information on the development and implementation (both successful and unsuccessful) of research plans of these two major Russian scholars on various turns of Russian history in the late 19th - first third of the 20th century in general and Russian humanities in particular, as well as numerous details of their personal relations and relations with colleagues for more than 30 years. The letters indicate the position of Bartold and Oldenburg not only on the most important academic issues related to European Oriental studies, but also on issues of social and political importance for the fate of Russia. An important aspect of the activities of Bartold and Oldenburg was the work to preserve the historical and cultural heritage of Russia, as well as to support public education and higher education. The correspondence between Bartold and Oldenburg is the most important source for reconstructing the scientific biographies of both scholars, as well as for reconstructing the history of Russian (Soviet) science and culture of the late 19th - first third of the 20th century. A brief overview of archival documents predates the publication of all correspondence between Bartold and Oldenburg.

AB The paper presents a retrospective of the formation of the concept of "Central Asia" in Russia. Using the documents of the 17th-19th centuries as an example, we study the transition from an early perception among employees in "Prikaz' s" and merchants exclusively of the states of the region (17th century) (Khiva kingdom, Bukhara kingdom) to a rather abstract "Asia" (18th century) and further to understanding "Central Asia" as a region. This process was due to the significant strengthening of the Russian Empire (the complication of its bureaucratic system). the expansion of influence through fortification lines in Western Siberia and south of Orenburg, as well as the growing geopolitical confrontation with the British Empire.

   the future; development model; social changes; political process
AB The article presents results of an empirical study by FCTAS RAS in order to analyze the spiritual state of modern Russian society and its ideas about itself, which should be considered as a special non -material factor for its development. The study was conducted in March April 2021 in a series of studies aimed at creating a kind of "sociological portrait" of modern Russian society, viewed through the prism of its self-esteem and self-image. In this article, the authors focuse on a facet of this sociological portraying, i.e. on the opinions of Russians about the ways of their country's development, assessments of the historical productivity of this path and, in this regard, their personal prospects, as well as on what they would like to see their country to be in the future. The authors analyze peculiarities of the perception of the arrow of time in the Russian mentality, characterize emotional tone of Russians' thinking about the future, characterize dynamics of the gradually increasing demand for change in Russian society, and examine in detail the views of the population of the country about what tasks currently facing Russian society are priorities and what ideas could unite Russians on the way to the future. Special attention is paid to the opinion of the Russian population about its relations to the West and the East. Basing on the results of empirical research, the authors state that Russian citizens perceive their country as an independently developing civilization and in this context reject mechanical following of Western models and recipes. In conclusion, the article examines the features of the political segmentation of the Russian society. An explanation is offered for the idea that, despite the fact that there is a demand for change in Russian society, a majority of citizens tend to support the current government and, despite all its shortcomings, would not want to change it by another one, at least now.

AB The epic synthesis in the works of I. S. Turgenev on the example of his last novel "Nov" is examined in the article. It is noted that the writer had high hopes for this work, since the novel was supposed to show Turgenev's true position in relation to the Russian people and the future of Russia. It is pointed out that in "Nov" there is no extensively revealed theme of peasant life, but it does not recede into the background: Turgenev represents a collective image of the people, evaluates events from the people's point of view. It is emphasized that the writer's attention to the reaction of the public, conditioned by the desire not only to present the most complete picture of life in Russia, but also to show the reader timeless samples of meaningful life, rising above various "questions". allows us to talk about the epic breadth of the novel. The author of the article proves that the artistic world of "Nov" can be read "layer by layer", reaching the key meanings: behind the external clashes of political forces is the problem of the relationship between people. their willingness to help each other. Parallels are drawn between the three essays added to the book "Notes of a Hunter" and individual episodes of the novel "Nov", their ideological and artistic connection is proved. It is concluded that the work of the late Turgenev cannot he analyzed without considering the opposition between the dramatic elements of destruction and the creative force, which is based on the Orthodox world outlook.

DE law; legal ontology; ascription
AB The "fusion strategy" formulated by Michael S. Moore is a kind of a skeptical answer to the question of the ontology of law. From the point of view of Professor Moore, the theory of legal language by Herbert Hart is one of the variants of the "fusion". On closer examination, we come to the conclusion that skepticism, which is a consequence of the "fusion" of the meaning of a word with a sentence, is relevant only when we insist on the variant of naturalistic legal ontology. For legally significant terms, it is impossible to determine the referent if they are excluded from the original sentence. The theory of the ascriptions of legal expression opens up new perspectives for the construction of a legal ontology. An example is the difference between the rule of law and law enforcement: if a rule of law is a rule that determines a certain course of action, then the specific situation of using the legal language allows establishing a connection between language and reality. Consequently, Hart's theory is wrong to qualify as skeptical.

DT Article
DE responsibility; patriotism; war; spiritual meaning; collective memory;
   deed
AB The article reveals the problem of collective responsibility in the works of the Russian philosopher I.A. Ilyin, shows the dynamics of the development of his ideas from early work to articles of the emigrant period. Responsibility is considered by I.A. Ilyin as a key concept that ensures the interconnection of the past and the future, which is especially acute in a situation of war. The First World War was supposed to be a source of spiritual uplift for the Russian people, but the ensuing revolution led to the emergence of a new socio-historical situation. According to I.A. Ilyin, traditional patriotism is replaced by its new form, in which responsibility for preserving Russian society forces neutrality in the armed confrontation between communist Russia and Nazi Germany. A key element of such a choice is moral justification, which forces us to abandon the idea of overthrowing the regime at the cost of the life of the people, but, at the same time, does not allow us to side with this regime. I.A. Ilyin notes the key mistakes of Nazi ideology that do not allow us to make a choice in its favor: sectarianism, right-wing totalitarianism, party monopoly, nationalism, nationalization of the economy, idolatrous Caesarism. As a result, the Russian thinker considers authoritarian regimes based on traditional social institutions and preserving the primacy of morality over rationality to be the most optimal form of political structure. The article justifies that the ideas of I.A. Ilyin demonstrate the complexity and ambiguity of understanding patriotism in the context of the transformation of collective subjects of responsibility, when there is an inconsistency between the images of historical memory and the real configuration of the political and social space.

The note is devoted to the search for a matrimonial match with a foreign prince for Anna Leopoldovna, the empress' niece and potentially mother of the future heir. The note testifies to its author's deep knowledge of the foreign policy situation and dynastic ties in Western Europe and ability to outline the most rational and useful vector for Russia's dynastic policy. Having carefully analysed the foreign policy and dynastic situation in Germany, the note's author is inclined to count on Prussia's help in choosing a match for Anna Leopoldovna, either from the Prussian House of Hohenzollern or from the House of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel.

DE heroes of the "Secret History"; history of the Mongols; Middle Ages
AB Research objectives: This article analyzes a new book by independent historian, Valery Zlygostev, written in the historical, biographical genre. The book is dedicated to outstanding figures in the medieval history of the Mongols, their allies, and opponents, as have been preserved in written sources. It discusses the territories eventually covered by the Mongol Empire, stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Pacific Ocean, during the period from the eighth to thirteenth century. Zlygostev traced the process of the establishment of Mongolian statehood, the formation of the Mongol Empire, and the expansion of its borders until the end of the era of conquests in the 1270s. The author reconstructs the biographies of all the characters of this period on the basis of the Mongol chronicle of c. 1240, traditionally called the "Secret History," alongside other sources.
   The scholarly novelty of the research lies in the presentation of the secondary and tertiary heroes of Mongolian history and their role in various military and political events that culminated in the creation of the greatest world empire in history. Particular attention is paid to the so-called "dark" period in the history of the Mongols stretching until the middle of the twelfth century, that is, the period of Chinggis Khan's birth. This period is still insufficiently analyzed in historiography and yet is very important for clarifying the prerequisite conditions which brought about the subsequent unification of Mongolia and the conquests of Chinggis Khan and his successors in Asia and Europe.
   The author has done a tremendous job of analyzing all available sources and identifying all possible details of the biography of certain heroes. The book is recommended for everyone interested in the medieval history of Eurasia.

TI BECOMING A VIRUS: SELF-ORGANIZATION OF THE MASSES IN RECENT DECADES
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE potentia; artificium; multitude; analogy; virus; meme; mass politics;
   institutions of modernity
AB According to our usual understanding of a virus, it is a parasite that spreads by forcing the host to make copies it. Cultural analogies to that concept have already given us the notion of a computer virus, a media virus or meme, and ideas as viruses infecting and propagating within the human brain, etc. But could the concept of a virus provide a useful analogy to political and social phenomena? The authors show how such an analogy illuminates the features of modern mass politics that remain obscure as long as political action is thought of in terms of identity, ideology, or private interest.
   The theoretical basis for regarding social and political phenomena as viruses is that the class of viruses is by nature analogous rather than homologous. This means that scientists can come to different conclusions about the origin of viruses and that several different theories may all be correct. Nevertheless, the term "virus" is meaningful precisely because of the analogy between all the entities called viruses. The core of this analogy is that all viruses use the same set of tricks (artificuim) to realize their essence (potentia). Viruses are parasitic on the organic machinery of other living beings, turning their malfunctions into their own reproductive system. That process also has a cognitive dimension because viruses learn only over succeeding generations. Viruses then live and act not as individual carriers, but only as procreating, mutating, learning multitudes. Their potentia is precisely analogous to the power of the multitudes, which Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri have discussed. It is a power which constitutes a new political order and simultaneously impoverishes the present one. The article explains the meaning of this analogy as it applies to the fate of the political and social institutions of late modernity.

DE political violence; Christianity; moral justification of violence;
   problem of legitimizing violence; pacifism; just war
AB The article examines the complex and ambiguous attitude of Christianity to political violence. The author shares the point of view of those researchers who believe that the concept of Christianity's denial of all violence is too simplistic. After all, otherwise it would be necessary to admit that Christianity denies all power and politics since, although they are not reduced to violence, they cannot be realized without it. However, this is not true. There are two traditions developed in Christianity, which are characterized by their specific attitude to the issue of legitimizing political violence: those who take the positions of Christian pacifism (from radical - non-resistance to evil by violence - to moderate) and those who consider it heresy. Radical Christian pacifism denies the possibility of a moral justification for violence, and its adherents believe that there is no ethically justified reason for it, including even the defense of faith. Another tradition, paying tribute to Christian ideals, is built on the idea of undesirability, but admissibility of the use of violence in public life, and justice becomes the main measure of this admissibility. This topic acquires particular relevance in the conditions of war, where one of the commandments of Christianity, "do not kill", is inevitably violated. Justice requires the protection of loved ones, and given the realities of the world, which "lies in evil", Christians conclude that violence is inevitable and it can be ethically justified, however, under certain conditions. These conditions are harsh and they are integral parts of the theory of just war, which was developed in the named Christian tradition. The theme of justice and violence, actualized by early and medieval Christianity, largely provoked modern discussions on the issues of morality and violence, war and virtue, and in general on the "culture of violence", justifying the importance of not neglecting certain ethical norms in a war. The topic of these discussions is extremely important for the modern world, which is characterized by the increasing complexity and the emergence of new forms of violence that gives rise to the need to combat it and form a humanistic policy that contributes to its moral and normative limitation. It seems that the "developments" of such a policy have been carried out for centuries and are formulated in many cultural traditions, including the Christian one, and can be in demand when forming the foundations of modern humanistic politics.

DT Article
DE religion and politics; supreme power; Patriarchate of Constantinople;
   Moscow Patriarchate; autocephaly; models of structure and functioning of
   Eastern Orthodox Church
AB The article examines the problem of supreme power in the Eastern Orthodox Church. This problem is not new, but it is becoming more and more pressing in the light of the recent events that took place in Ukraine and are related to the granting of a tomos to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine by Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople. The Russian Orthodox Church regarded the actions of the Ecumenical Patriarch as an invasion of someone else's canonical territory, which led to a conflict in which other local churches are gradually being involved. The roots of this confrontation are in the mismatch of ideas about the due model of structure of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Today, there are two such models, and the fundamental difference between them lies in the different vision of the subject exercising power on a pan-Orthodox scale. The model of "sovereign autocephaly" is based on the idea of the equality of all autocephalous churches, each of which has full authority within its canonical territory. The other model, which can be called the model of "autocephaly with limited sovereignty", is based on the idea of the coordinating and governing role of Constantinople within the Eastern Orthodox Church. At first glance, the reasons for the conflict between Orthodox churches are of a religious nature and relate exclusively to issues of church law. Meanwhile, there is no doubt that the above-mentioned conflict has not only a religious but also a political dimension. Ultimately, the struggle goes on not only to maintain influence in Ukraine and leadership in the Orthodox world, but also to maintain own importance in world politics. The redrawing of the borders of the Orthodox world, initiated by the Ecumenical Patriarch, has already led to serious political consequences. Bartholomew actively cooperates with the secular authorities of those states that need their "own" church. This cooperation turns out to be mutually beneficial: the former legally realizes his power ambitions, the latter solve their domestic political and geopolitical tasks by using the religious factor. Disputes about the due model of the Eastern Orthodox Church are a reflection of the problem of supreme power in world Orthodoxy, on the solution of which will depend not only the very existence of Eastern Orthodoxy in the current format, but also the further development of political events in those states that are directly related to the activities of local Orthodox Churches.

AB The purpose of the article is to identify the features of the development of the idea of human rights, starting from the Ancient World, and on this basis to show its significance in the digital age. To achieve this goal, the conceptual foundations of the idea of human rights and their reflection in political and legal thought at different stages of the evolution of society and science are analysed. The subject of the study was the concept of human rights. The study was conducted on the basis of post-non-classical scientific methodology, including constructivism. The formal-legal and comparative-historical methods are also used.
   According to the results of the study, it is concluded that in the conditions of modern technological development, digitalisation is becoming a challenge to the idea of human rights, a threat to individual freedom, and therefore it is necessary to develop and implement new legal mechanisms that would guarantee the full implementation of fundamental rights and freedoms, provide the necessary balance between individual freedom and public security. In this context, the legal consolidation and practical implementation of the principle of formal equality become important.

AB Value-added taxation is a multidimensional theoretical, fiscal and legal structure. It also serves as a tool for the practical transformation of political, legal and socio-economic relations. The objective of the research is to study new concepts of value-added taxation formed in the two largest BRICS economies (the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India). The assumption is that not only "European" model of the legal regulation of VAT can be successful, but alternatively "Chinese" and "Indian models." The author examines and evaluates changes in the legal structure of value added tax in general, and its elements focusing on the current stage of legal regulation of national systems of VAT (GST) in China and India. In addition, the political, legal, social and economic effects of the legal mechanism of VAT (GST) in China and India from 2017 to 2020 are demonstrated.

In the first half of the twenty-first century, there is a change in the geopolitical map of the world, where the complexly structured world of Eastern civilizations, which geographically belongs to the Asian region, comes to the fore. In the international political science discourse, the theme of Asianization', Asiancentrism' in the 21st century came to the fore, which is methodologically developed in the concept of polycentrism, global regionalism and a non-Western world political picture of the world. As a result, on one hand, Eastern civilizations are returning the political and economic positions lost in recent centuries, and on the other hand, being technologically westernized, they introduce non-Western mental and value attitudes into world politics.

AB Research objectives: To trace the fate of the sixteenth-century aristocrats from the Mansur kin of the Crimean Manghits, namely the brothers Baki, Khoja-Akhmed, Ak-Bibi, and Divei. To identify their role in political events in Eastern Europe and to establish the circumstances of the capture, stay in captivity, and the death of Divei - the most famous of these brothers.
   Research materials: Chronicles, Razriad books, diplomatic documents, folklore, and secondary materials of historical research.
   Results and novelty of the research: The author traced the fate of the brothers from the noble Maghit kin of Mansur, namely Baki, Khoja-Akhmed, Ak-Bibi and Divei, three of whom became Qarachi-beks in Crimea. They participated in the political life of Crimea, the Nogai Horde, Astrakhan, Azov, the Russian state, Hungary, and Iran. Prince Divei was a typical steppe bagatur, a seeker of fame and fortune, as well as an active enemy of the Russian State. He repeatedly raided the Russian lands and displayed outstanding abilities as a commander. He was aggressive, brave, determined, and cruel. In 1572, he commanded the Crimean troops in the Battle of Molodino and was captured by the Russians. The capture of their commander was one of the reasons for the defeat of the Crimeans. This event once more saved the Russian state from external dependence. Devlet-Girei Khan made considerable efforts to free the Qarachi-bek during the battle, but these were in vain. Attempts to redeem or exchange the prisoner were likewise in vain. Ivan the Terrible was aware of the threat posed by this figure and did not want to free his noble prisoner. In 1576, the death of Prince Divei was announced in Moscow. Historiography calls into question his death in 1575. There is an opinion that Divei was baptized and entered the service of Ivan the Terrible under the name of Daniil-murza. In this article, the author contends that those historians who compared Divei with Daniil-murza approached the issue superficially, not considering all the sources, and therefore came to the wrong conclusions. These began to be repeated in subsequent publications. Prince Divei and Daniil-murza were different persons. Divei did not agree to accept Orthodoxy and was executed. The elimination of the famous military leader from its political life contributed to a decrease in the aggression of the Crimean Khanate towards Russia as well as the destabilization of the political situation in Crimea.

SO MIR ROSSII-UNIVERSE OF RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Book Review
DE politics; management; governance; government; economic development;
   power; corruption
AB The article deliberates on the idea that, despite many obvious differences, Singapore and Russia have something in common-in particular, the uniqueness of their geographical parameters. It further provides a closer look at the model of the Singapore miracle, as presented in the book by Lee Kuan Yew "From the Third World to the First. History of Singapore (1965-2000)". This article discusses the opposite developmental trends of the two countries in the recent decades in order to make the case that the Singapore model implemented by Lee Kuan Yew is an important factor. While Singapore moved from the Third World to the First, Russia descended from the First World to the Third. To illustrate this "great castling", the article provides data on where the two countries are located in the expanded innovation and technology matrix. In this matrix, Russia lies between the periphery and the semi-periphery, while Singapore has for many years remained among the leaders, confidently ahead of such core countries as the US and some leading European states. The author further considers some fundamental differences in the political models of Singapore and Russia. Singapore's distinct features include relying on common sense, intuition and tradition in their policy-making processes; a constant dialogue between the government and the people in explaining important state decisions; the quick and uncompromising reaction of government members to media allegations of corruption and concern for their reputation. A completely different political model is typical for Russia: blind and formal adoption of Western managerial patterns and practices; the maximum isolation of the government from the people; systematic disregard for public accusations against officials regarding their income and corruption. Considering the Singaporean model allows us to deduce the original formula for success: it must equal brilliant management + total perfectionism. Great emphasis on management effectiveness and meritocracy in the recruitment of state officials responsible for important decisions were important factors of advancing Singapore along the path of economic development. One of the main achievements of Lee Kuan Yew was to ensure continuity in state policy for more than 60 years. This is what fundamentally distinguishes him from the Russian rulers, whose replacement is usually accompanied by radical changes in the political course.

AB The development of statehood is predetermined by a great variety of factors. In modern society, citizens are developing an increasing willingness to fully participate in political and legal processes jointly with the state. Today the ideas of deliberative democracy attract the close attention of legal theorists in this aspect. The subject of the research is the key aspects of the philosophical and legal treatment of social relations in the sphere of realisation of the principle of deliberation in modern Russia. The purpose of this study is a multilevel analysis (general legal, philosophical, technical/legal) of the principle of deliberation, with substantiation of its significance as a key foundation of statehood in modern Russia. The research results confirm the initial hypothesis and evidence that the goal of the study has been achieved. The con elation of state and public interests in terms of deliberative interaction is of fundamental importance for the development of Russian statehood.

DE Alexander von Humboldt; multiculturalism; F. Znanetsky
AB The author studies the reception of A. von Humboldt of the humanitarian problems of his time. In his works Humboldt articulated many ideas of the just social order and even of multiculturalism. But despite great interest towards the natural science of the regions he visited, the researcher avoided public judgments about social problems of these states' residents. A. Humboldt criticized many actual social problems: aggressive cultural assimilation, colonialism, slavery, social inequality etc., but avoided public demands of social transformations in the regions he visited. He either could reject any violent social transformations or looking for loyalty of the state's authorities, that financed and organized his expeditions. A. Humboldt, the opponent of slavery, never once spoke critically about slavery in a personal conversation or correspondence with T. Jefferson. During his journey across Russia, the scientist was extremely careful in his judgments about the Russian bondmen. The inconsistency of the Humboldt's personal liberal position and his humanitarian blindness to socio-political problems illustrates the problem of the relationship between people of authority and people of knowledge, that was announce by F. Znanetsky. Humboldt who was primarily such a lay counselor just focused on his own academic research thar was his main priority.

AB The history of the Bolshevik party figured prominently in the reform of postrevolutionary Soviet science. After the Civil War, many revolutionaries who took accelerated special learning courses subsequently became professors and heads of newly organized academic institutions. Their aim was to prepare new ideologically strong specialists for the country. However, despite their considerable contribution to higher education in the prewar USSR, a significant number of "red professors" became victims of repression in the 1930s. Otto Augustovich Lidak - one of the main Leningrad historians of the Bolshevik party in the 1930s - was a bright representative of this generation. As a Bolshevik in the Civil war, he traveled from Lithuania to the Siberian city of Minusinsk and from Petrograd to Persia. Having all the necessary qualities (social background, revolutionary experience, connections, etc.), O.A. Lidak was able to build a successful academic career within a short period. At various times, he was the head of the Institute of History of the CPSU(b) and the Communist Institute of Journalism. He was also a professor in the Leningrad branch of the Communist Academy, Communist University, Leningrad State University. Finally, he was an active member of the Society of Marxist Historians, the Society of former Political Prisoners and Exiles, etc. Thus, he was involved in the work of all the major party institutions that prepared "pro-Soviet" cadres. This article considers the milestones of Udak's biography and also explores his contribution to the historiography of the Russian Revolution.

AB The statement about low electoral activity of young people is among the empirically proven ones. However, voting (or not voting) is not the only way for young people to participate in the electoral process. Election campaigns are a space of activity with a variety of functional positions that differ in qualification requirements and the size of pay. In this article, election campaigns are considered not from the point of view of ideology, but as organizational formats to involve young people in activities related to the organization and election campaigning in the Russian Federation. We are talking about the activities of young people as street agitators (traditionally called volunteers), organizers of the work in election headquarters, public observers or members of precinct election commissions. The article consistently answers the questions: what are the channels for recruiting young people in election campaigns? What is motivating young people? What forms of activity do carriers of differing motivations choose? How do young people summarize their experience of participating in election campaigns in terms of their political and career self-determination? The answers to these questions were obtained on the basis of interviews with persons under 28 who had experience of participating in election campaigns in the Russian Federation.

AB The Second World War has undoubtedly left a deep scar on the historical memory of the Polish people. The hardest ordeal for the Polish Republic was the military confrontation with Nazi Germany, which resulted in the loss of statehood and the horrors of the German occupation regime. As a result of World War II, Poland lost almost 40% of its national wealth and about 6 million of its people. The issue of political interpretations of historical events in contemporary Polish historical and political discourse is of particular importance. Reflected in educational literature, it is no less important than the positions set out in academic journals. Yesterday's schoolboy and student today is a minister's assistant and an officer, tomorrow a minister and a general. At the same time, there is no certainty that they will again turn to systemic education. One should also take into account the current status of the Polish Republic, its fundamental economic achievements and the apparent desire for an independent line in the European Union. All this makes the dialogue actual even in the current extremely difficult conditions.

AB Introduction. Scientific understanding of current and future trends in the development of society, the formulation of problems of social development, and even more so its prediction is associated with the analysis of the role and place of modern and promising communication technologies in the complex architecture of social interactions. Today, such technologies determine the direction of restructuring traditional political and economic institutions contribute to the formation of fundamentally new formats of social interactions. The beginning of the 21st century was marked by a wide spread of sharing relations - old socio-economic practices of joint (shared) use of goods in a new technical and technological design. The driver of the development of joint consumption practices has also been the spread of global trends in the transition from a system of strong fundamental links between socioeconomic entities to weaker but numerous temporary links. Methods and materials. In the course of the study, the sharing economy was considered through the prism of structural-functional, neoinstitutional and network approaches. The authors used system analysis, interdisciplinary and empirical methods (questionnaire, expert survey), as well as the method of social modeling. The materials for the study were the publications of leading foreign and domestic researchers of the issue in peer-reviewed scientific publications, as well as the results of a cross-regional sociological study conducted by the authors. Analysis. Currently, an institutional formation of a new ontological reality within which self-regulating, more autonomous from the state, sharing communities built on the network principle function is taking place. Through the liberalization of access to a wide range of benefits through low-cost channels, sharing contributes to the growth of trust, social well-being, and reduction of social tension. At the same time, the uncontrolled spread of sharing practices is fraught with a drop in the level of institutional and interpersonal trust, an increase in conflict in society, and the deformation of regional and sectoral labor markets, which will naturally affect social well- being and political stability. Results. The obtained results confirmed the hypothesis of the study that the practices of joint consumption in Russia have a pronounced development potential and a growing influence on the political sphere through the growth of political activity of the population participating in these practices, through the actualization of microsocial contracts and the subsequent translation of their content to the macro level.

DE Hermann Cohen; Immanuel Kant; Baruch Spinoza; Neo-Kantianism; Marburg
   school; philosophy of religion; ethics; Judaism; Old Testament
AB The article analyzes the main characteristic features of the philosophy of religion of the founder of the Marburg school of neo-Kantianism Hermann Cohen. Special attention is paid to Cohen's criticism and reinterpretation of Kant's "practical philosophy" from the point of view of the philosophy of religion: Cohen supplements and expands Kant's provisions on moral law and moral duty, interpreting them as divine commandments. The authors emphasize the fundamental importance for Cohen of the "internal similarity" between Kant's ethical teaching and the main provisions of Judaism. The sources of Kant's own ideas about the Jewish tradition are shown, which include the work of Moses Mendelssohn "Jerusalem" and the " Theologicalpolitical treatise" by Baruch Spinoza. Cohen's criticism of these works is analyzed an much attention is paid to the consideration of Cohen's attitude to Spinoza's philosophical legacy in general. The interpretation of the postulates of Judaism by Cohen (and their "inner kinship" with Kant's moral philosophy) in ethical, logical, and political contexts is presented. Cohen's understanding of such religious-philosophical and doctrinal phenomena as law, grace, Revelation, teaching, the Torah, messianism, freedom, the Old Testament and the New Testament, etc. is provided and analyzed. The main points of Cohen's religious teaching as "ethical monotheism" are considered; in particular, the authors analyze his understanding of the idea of God as "the only one", which is highlighted in the works of Paul Natorp. It is concluded that Cohen's philosophy of religion, which is based on the postulates of Judaism as well as Kant's "practical philosophy", could be characterized by the terms "ethical monotheism", "universalism" and "humanism".

AB The article contains a translation and an original text of the report of Ratmann of Lubeck, Zhachariah Meyer, about his diplomatic trips to Moscow in 1586-1587. The document is stored in the Archives of the Hanseatic City of Lubeck (Archiv der Hansestadt Lubeck) and has not been published so far. On behalf of a magistrate of Lubeck Meyer visited the court of Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich in Novgorod and Pskov. In the context of the transformation of the Hanseatic League, which took place in the second half of the 16th century, in order to retain the status of its head, Ltibeck needed to take a leading position in the supply of Russian export products to the Western European market. To achieve this goal, it was necessary to reject commercial and diplomatic mediation of the Hanseatic cities of Livonia, which during the Livonian War fell under foreign rule, and carry out its own program set out in the pamphlet "Kiirtzer Bericht..." of 1571. Meyer's report, which includes the German text of the letters patent from Fyodor Ioannovich to Lubeck in 1586, the translations of the tsar' s letters to the governors of Novgorod and Pskov, and Meyer' s petitions, testifies to the successful start of this program. The report, among other things, contains information about situations in the trading courtyards of Novgorod and Pskov, in particular, about their relations with the city administration. Their lack of self-government and administrative dependence on the Russian authorities distinguished the Ltibeck courtyards from the Hanseatic offices in their heyday.

LA Russian

DE world order; globalization; network; panopticon; synopticon; banopticon
AB The article discusses modern approaches to the study of the global public order, including the analysis of factors contributing to its formation and the consideration of the forms that it takes. The phenomenon of the global public order characterizes the postmodern situation, described in the categories of decentralization, fragmentation, depersonalization of power, and indirect control through network structures. According to the authors, the global public order is becoming more and more an object of interdisciplinary research, in particular, it is actively considered from the standpoint of structural analysis. The authors conclude that the process of adaptation of new forms of the global public order to the dynamically changing global reality is currently underway. As a result of the research, it was possible to identify and generalize the patterns associated with the transformation of forms and mechanisms of public order in the context of modern global processes: 1. Public order is emerging today as an independent phenomenon and cannot be reduced exclusively to formal legal, communicative, organizational and political aspects. 2. Modern public order is inextricably linked with the situation of "liquid modernity" and the formation of the system of "liquid observation", in which the panopticon a form of public control is gradually stepping aside. 3. Public order is associated with the formation of a global control matrix based on modern global communication technologies. 4. The structural basis of the emerging public order model is the combination of such forms of public control as the synopticon ("surveillance of the few by the many") and the banopticon (with polarization and exclusion from the public space of the "undesirable"), with some elements of the panopticon retaining. 5. The approval of new forms of public order and public control is accompanied by a new "revolution of managers", when the latter are gradually relieved of their duties to exercise guardianship and control over the broad masses of people, transferring the implementation of control procedures to previously subordinate objects. 6. The state retains, within the limits of its competence, part of the powers to implement public order, while retaining its own segment of public control. 7. The emergence of global public control leads to the separation of politics and governance. The approach proposed by the authors to the study of the emerging global political order obviously needs further elaboration and specification. In the authors' opinion, it is the updated understanding of the nature and methods of formation (reproduction) of the global public order that will make it possible to concretize the meaning of this concept and make it the property of the general public. The very concept of the global public order allows concretizing the content and meaning of the concepts "world order" and "global governance", providing additional opportunities for the formation and use of public communications, political modeling, political propaganda and political engineering. The global public order presupposes not only a certain consensus of the world elites, but also the building of public opinion and the sociopolitical situation based on the laws of the internal dynamics of society.

AB Introduction. The article is devoted to the features and historical evolution of the Soviet-Chinese (later Russian-Chinese) relations from the moment of the proclamation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 to the present. The analysis of the complex of factors that determined the complex dynamics of the relations between the two countries was carried out by the author of the article. It is shown that the Soviet-Chinese (later - Russian-Chinese) relations developed from close alliance to alienation and confrontation - with reaching a level of strategic partnership in the second decade of the 21st century. Methods and materials. The authors seek a combination of general theoretical and special methods, focusing on the historical, sociocultural and political analysis. They are based on the analysis of periodicals, as well as using books, articles and materials of researchers on the problems of the political development of China and the USSR (Russia) and on the transformation of the nature of their bilateral relations. The author analyzes the current situation in the relations between the two countries, according to which the nature of the development of the general situation in international relations and the objective foreign policy interests of China and Russia encourage them to build and deepen bilateral partnership. Results. According to the author, many of the reasons that gave rise to a conflict of interests and confrontation between the two countries in previous years are exhausted today. At the same time, the joint participation of China and Russia in the formation and adoption of a new, more equitable and sustainable world order, in the settlement of conflicts and crises, in the arrangement of the Greater Eurasia space seems to the author justified and promising. Among the factors defining the nature of the Sino-Soviet relations the author identifies the relationship between the leaders of the two countries, the difference of geopolitical concepts and approaches, ideological disputes and differences in the views on strategy and prospects of the communist movement, the logic of the socio-political and socio-economic development in the context of modernization. The changing and contradictory correlation of these factors determined the development of the Soviet-Chinese (later Russian-Chinese) relations from a close alliance to mutual distancing and confrontation with the subsequent entry into strategic partnership.

AB The article examines the concept of radicalism from a legal and social point of view, and also compares the strategies of deradicalization in the Russian Federation and non-CIS countries under the circumstances of the digital reality affecting youth's communication. Based on the method of concept analysis, the author uses a comparative approach to analyze and synthesize definitions of the term "radicalism" in the legal acts of the Russian Federation, Canada, France, and Malaysia, dictionaries of these countries, and manuals of organizations combating radicalization of youth. She establishes the similarity of the descriptions of the term "radicalism" in the dictionaries and its absence in the legal acts of the countries. The derivative term "radicalization" (the process of involvement in radicalism) is present in the legal acts of the countries as an accompanying one when describing terrorist acts or violent extremism, but it neither is described in a separate article nor has its own criminal or administrative penalty. The author reveals the difference in the definitions of the term "radicalization" on the publicly accessible websites of organizations dealing with deradicalization of youth in the above-mentioned countries. In the Russian Federation, the term " radicalization" has the least negative description. In Canada, the emphasis is on the distinction between radicalization as such and radicalization leading to violence. In France, the description of the term "radicalization" initially indicates the use of violence and a direct connection with extremism, while in Malaysia only the possibility of subsequent extremism and terrorism by radicalized citizens is mentioned. The difference in public opinion revealed by this study may lie in the varying experience of resonant clashes with the consequences of youth radicalization. Despite the difference in assessing the degree of the negative impact of radicalism, in all four countries a paradigm shift can be detected in their citizens' public consciousness. Radicalism, previously viewed on the same level as anarchism, is now located closer to extremism and terrorism on the moral scale. The new digital reality is a contributing factor to such a change. The Internet is evolving faster than the legal framework for its use, and this fact does not go unnoticed by propagandists of violent extremism and terrorism. Governments, civil society organizations, and law enforcement agencies in the four surveyed countries use different approaches to develop a deradicalization strategy on the Internet, and could improve their results by sharing their ideas and experiences.

AB The facts testifying to the intention of the Russian Empire in the middle of the 18th century to establish equal mutually beneficial relations with China is presented in the article. Fragments of archival documents (decrees, memoranda, instructions, reports, etc.) about the expedition of the courier V. F. Bratishchev are given. The main attention is paid to the analysis of documents, which provide descriptions of the long preparation of the diplomatic visit, negotiations of V. F. Bratishchev with Qing officials in China. The degree of informativeness of documentary sources is assessed. The documents demonstrate the serious intention of the Russian administration to resolve political and economic issues through negotiations that would allow the Russian Empire to strengthen its position in the Far East. The article notes the principles of functioning of the administrative system of the Russian Empire in the middle of the 18th century. The author of this article considers the diplomatic visit of V. F. Bratishchev to be an example of the clash between the principles of Eurocentrism, which were actively gaining positions in the policy of the Russian ruling elite, and the ideas of the inhabitants of the Middle Empire about the superiority of their own civilization, surrounded by barbarians. Studying this historical event and taking into account the diplomatic mistakes made are relevant both for historical science and modern political interstate interaction.

AB Introduction. The purpose of this study is to describe significant historical events that have transformed the foundations of Chinese statehood, and to emphasize the peculiarities of their reflection in the Russian periodicals. The article presents the characteristics of the Qing Empire's last decade of existence. This topic is relevant in the study of both world and national history, since the monarchical system in Russia during this period was also experiencing a profound crisis. Methods and materials. Based on the principle of historicism, the dialectical method of scientific knowledge was applied. The systematic and comparative methods made it possible to combine and compare various publications within one research project. Publications of Russian magazines and newspapers of various ideological orientations, aimed at mass and elite readers, are used as a historical source. Among them are magazines "Vestnik of Asia" and "News of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs" for a professionally trained reader, as well as literary and political ("Northern Notes", "Russian Thought", "Vestnik of Europe") and historical and literary ("Vestnik of Foreign Literature") publications of a moderately liberal orientation. Such popular science (with a literary and literary-political trend) magazines as "Russian wealth", "The whole world", "Vestnik Znaniya", "The world" propagandized the achievements of European civilization, including the positive results of reforms held in China on the European model, among the broad strata of the Russian population. The largest amount of information about reforms in China and calls to carry out or, on the contrary, prevent such transformations in Russia, is contained in newspapers of various ideological orientations, such as "Russian Banner", "St. Petersburg Vedomosti", "Speech", "Pravda" and "Neva Star". Analysis. The articles containing information on the reasons and content of the reform activities of the Qing dynasty were analyzed. The role of Russian periodicals in the formation of ideas of various social groups about the political, socio-economic changes taking place in China is shown. Political and socio-economic problems that have analogies in the Russian Empire are emphasized. Results. The idealization of the Chinese culture of the past centuries is now a thing of the past. In the pages of newspapers and magazines, the image of China was quickly transformed. Despite the irregular and haphazard flow of information and the borrowing of subjective assessments of authors from foreign publications, representatives of various Russian ideological trends fought among themselves, using subjects from the life of modern China as examples. China's movement from traditionalism to constitutionalism was of the greatest interest to the Russian progressive public.

AB The article focuses on Michel Foucault's work with the social history of medicine and evaluates its potential for analyzing the political impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Foucault reveals the bond between quarantine measures in European cities and the gradual perfection of techniques of power. He uses organized anti-epidemic activities applied to leprosy and plague as examples of "compact models" of power relations that he discusses in terms of exclusion and discipline. He reveals complex relationships between the physical body of an individual and what he calls the "social body" of a state.
   Foucault describes how "health policy" was formed during the second half of 18th century when it drastically changed urban space and became one of the key techniques of government. In Foucault's lectures published as Security, Territory, Population, he turns to the concept of a "prevailing" or literally "reigning" disease. The countermeasures against the disease enable the development of special techniques applicable to the population in a given historical period. He uses the statistical description of patients suffering from smallpox as an example of how a regime of power and government of the population develops by invoking security and risk assessment. In the concluding section, the author estimates the potential of Foucauldian historical analysis as a tool for anticipating the tendencies inherent in the techniques of power mobilized to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

Along with organizational and structural changes in the field special attention is devoted to new subjects and trends in the study of the region, with Belarus as a case study. Research in this field began in the 90s and has been booming since the 2000s. Researchers are primarily interested in the history of the country, political science, anthropology, and literary studies. The formation of an international community of researchers allows us to conclude that previously "Western" discipline of REES is gaining a global character.

It remains an important cultural and socio-political factor in public life, and "Northern" and "Southern" character types are still recognizable. By the example of complexity and inconsistency of the historical memory of the Civil War, slavery, and its abolition in the USA, the paper documents how through the collective memory, history does not just invade modernity but is present in it, particularly in the form of memorials, monuments, museum expositions, and therefore determines modernity to a large degree.

DT Article
DE French Physiocrats; Chinese influence; concept of social formation;
   "Despotism in China"; "Tableau Economique"; Quesnay
AB The paper analyzes the Chinese influences on the doctrine of the French physiocrat Francois Quesnay from the perspective of the cultural specifics of the perception of economic and political ideas. The approaches of Chinese researchers were impacted by Marxist methodology, sinocentric views and fragmentary use of primary sources. The application of the Marxist concept of socio-economic formations supported the arguments that feudal Confucianism could not influence the views of physiocrats, which reflected the emergence of capitalist relations. In the 18th century opponents of the physiocrats used the comparison of the Tableau Economique with the scheme of the Chinese Book of Changes to disqualify Quesnay's doctrine. For Chinese researchers this comparison became a confirmation of the value of the Tableau Economique and an incentive to search for the ideas of circular flows and equilibrium in both tables. The study of Despotism in China content confirms its connection with the actual historical China. It is concluded that Chinese scholars seek to interpret the historical precedent of the influence of Confucian thought on Quesnay's doctrine in the context of plans to increase the global clout of China's social sciences.

AB Introduction. The realities of modern society reflect the demand of science to understand, explain and stage the structural transformations of the political process of a digital nature. Civic Internet activity is acquiring non-hierarchical forms and is ahead of technological practices used by the state. Introducing themselves into the modern political process, network organizational structures allow the formation of strong horizontal ties, acting as a tool for accumulating public opinion and mobilizing intellectual resources. Methods and methodology. In this article, the features of digital citizenship are considered through the following theoretical and methodological foundations: digital citizenship in the concept of a network club; generational theory of being digital citizens; digital citizenship as a value system of user strategies; the administrative plane of obtaining the legal status of a citizen in the network. Analysis. Synergy effects from joint activities of government, business and civil society institutions in the implementation of digital citizenship are extremely important. In connection with the creation of digital citizenship infrastructure in the Russian Federation, obtaining a digital profile of a citizen is of particular importance. Particular attention is paid to the risk factors for digital citizenship. The need to develop trust bridges between government and society, where co-management contributes to the formation of a safe and comfortable environment in physical and digital spaces, is argued. Results. The authors proposed the concept of architecture for building digital citizenship, which consists of the phased implementation of digital services: 1) the introduction of platform solutions in the field of public administration: the provision of public services in digital format, the launch of the Public Services Portal of the Russian Federation; 2) an increase in the number of public services provided in the online format, the launch of the Unified Identification and Authentication System (ESIA); 3) the Russian Federations citizen's digital profile creation, the launch of digital super services at the ESIA website, the introduction of an electronic passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. It is concluded that the digital citizenship has new end-to-end communication capabilities, coupled with the extraterritoriality of processes. It is proved that digital citizenship is a fundamental right in the digital age. Digital literacy and digital security stand out as important elements of digital citizenship.

SO CHANGING SOCIETIES & PERSONALITIES
LA English
DT Article
DE colonial revolution; post-colonial studies; liberatory war; Georgy
   Safarov; Mao Zedong; Frantz Fanon
AB The article investigates the intellectual roots of the concept of colonial revolution, which goes back to the 2nd congress of the Communist International, examines its importance in shaping the Communist political thought and outlines its subsequent transformation in the wake of post-colonial theory. The author starts with analyzing the political ideas of Georgy Safarov-Comintern [the Communist International] theorist. He was among the most original thinkers who elaborated the concept of colonial revolution. Safarov, drawing from his own experience in Central Asia, insisted that global capitalism is "retreating to the positions of feudalism" while operating in colonies, treating them as collective "serfs" and lacking any proper social basis save for its own enormous military force. Such analogy led Safarov to envisage the colonial revolution as a "plebeian" revolt and liberatory war against the inhumane and stagnant colonial order, opening the way for a non-capitalist development with certain assistance from the Soviet Union. Similar ideas were independently formulated by Mao Zedong in the 1930s. He saw colonial revolution in China as a "protracted war" of liberation and listed the conditions under which victory was possible. However, the subsequent development of a former colony was seen by Mao as a transitory period of 'democratic dictatorship". Similar ideas of colonial revolution as a liberatory peasant war and "plebeian" movement were developed by Franz Fanon in the context of his own war experience in Algeria. Developing the idea of "plebeian", peasant revolt and justifying the violence as the sole means of ending the rule of colonial power, Fanon at the same time differed from the tradition of the 2nd Comintern Congress (represented by Safarov, Mao and the others) while describing the independent existence of former colonies. For Fanon, the worst consequence of colonial rule is not permanent backwardness but psychological trauma, an inevitable result of a brutal conquest which requires therapy. The author concludes that such conceptual transformation was stimulated not merely by the disappointment in Soviet and Chinese economic strategies, but also in the geographical and cultural factor which made the reintegration with the former colonial powers preferable to the direct "escape" into the socialist camp.

AB The article is devoted to the elections to the city councils of the Kuhan Territory, which took place in the spring and autumn of 1919. The author dwells in detail on the Kuban electoral law, according to which, for the first time in Russia, a rather rare electoral system - panachage - was used, and on the results of its application. Election campaigns in Yekaterinodar and other cities of the region are considered, the results of voting and the composition of councillors are analyzed. By the example of Yekaterinodar, the difference in electoral preferences of residents of "bourgeois" and "proletarian" regions is shown, as well as the influence of the educational and property level, occupation on the political preferences of the townspeople. Special attention is paid to the story of the murder in the editorial office of the newspaper "Utro Yuga", which was caused by the struggle between moderately socialist electoral associations, and one of the immediate reasons was S. Ya. Marshak's election poems. The general results of the elections show that in most cities of the region the victory was won by the "right" homeowners' lists, but the author believes that the reason for this was not so much a change in the mood of the masses as the absenteeism of the left and centrist electorate.

DE best of all possible worlds; worst of all possible worlds; Leibniz;
   Schopenhauer
AB One of the key metaphysical questions is the question of the principle of the structure of the universe, and Leibniz's theodicy and Schopenhauer's pathodicy can be distinguished as extreme positions. According to their ideas, the world is arranged either in the best or the worst possible way. The problem of theodicy and evil in the world is being actualized in the context of modern discussions about free will and moral responsibility. In order to justify God, Leibniz argues that God does not desire evil at all, but only allows it without compromising his holiness. Evil cannot be the content of God's prior will, but evil can be an indirect consequence of his will, when no greater good can be achieved by eliminating evil. Schopenhauer disputes Leibniz's argument. He asserts that real suffering is never destroyed by future joys, because suffering fills its time as much as joy fills its own. Schopenhauer not only argues that the world is the best - he offers proof that our world is the worst. The vaunted perfections of the universe are only necessary conditions. They minimally support the existence of the world. Schopenhauer's proof is not rigorous in nature, it is more a parody of Leibniz's proof than an independent strictly verified logical construction. The question of whether Schopenhauer managed to win in the correspondence discussion with Leibniz cannot be answered unequivocally. On the one hand, Schopenhauer showed that the idea of the best of all possible worlds is utopian and poorly applicable to reality. He was not based on the axiom of the divine presence, and, because of this, his reasoning looks more relevant today. Schopenhauer's argument about the worst possible world turned out to be in demand and gave rise to a discussion about pessimism at the end of the 19th century. On the other hand, Schopenhauer's own proof from the point of view of logic and the theory of argumentation is much weaker than Leibniz's proof. Schopenhauer's proof does not agree with his own philosophy and looks like an artificial construction, while Leibniz's proof fits neatly into his system. Schopenhauer's criticism of Leibniz's optimism may take place, but his own argument is even more sophistical. The actual world can be called both the best and the worst of all possible worlds. In this sense, Eduard von Hartmann's version seems to be successful: the best world can be as bad as possible, but this does not contradict the fact that it is the best.

DE religious consciousness; morality; man; society
AB The appeal to Russian religious thinkers is relevant due to the fact that modern consumer trends in the development of society have a destructive impact on the human personality. In these conditions, the relevance of moral and anthropological reflections of the past, which were carried out in the Russian religious thought of the 19th century, increases. Dostoevsky's oeuvre goes beyond the boundaries of fiction, it includes a deep philosophical search in social and moral-religious spheres. His literary heroes strive to find meanings that can fill their lives. The writer believed that these meanings can be found in the sphere of Christian consciousness. This was his philosophical path, presented in the figurative sphere of literature. His contemporary Vladimir Solovyov solved the same problem in the field of philosophical theoretical consciousness. Both thinkers pointed to the primacy of the moral sense for a person, which is later comprehended in moral philosophy. Solovyov calls shame, pity (altruism), and reverence the fundamental manifestations of morality. Religion does not generate moral principles, but gives them expression. The thinkers point to the active nature of moral meanings manifested both in individual and social behavior of a person. In Dostoevsky's works, the actions of the heroes are determined by their moral experiences. Solovyov points to the limitations of abstract subjectivism in morality and to the moral progress of society as an indicator of its historical development. It is important for Solovyov to consider the manifestation of moral principles in human economic activity, which, as he believed, should also be an organized realization of good. The philosophical heritage of Russian thinkers remains significant for the modern secular consciousness, which is looking for the roots of morality in symbolic behavior programs set by culture. In this context, morality appears as a fundamental culture-species program that consolidates the human community as a global cultural and biological species.

DE polyethnicity; Republic of Buryatia; Buryats; Russians; polyethnic
   region
AB The perception of polyethnicity as an important feature of modern society is based on the subject's reaction to differences. Polyethnicity implies a presence in the structure of the social community of representatives of two or more ethnic groups. Usually polyethnicity is a result of objective social processes, which happened in Russia too. Today the Russian Federation is a polyethnic country, and almost all subjects of the federation are polyethnic. The main types of polyethnicity are traditional (a rich experience of interethnic interaction of people, large number of old residents with different ethnic origins that formed the polyethnic core of the settlement/region) and new, formed in the 20th century. It is advisable to differentiate individuals living in polyethnic environments as old residents and newcomers according to the criterion of duration. The polyethnicity of Buryatia was formed during several centuries and gradually became one of the features of people's lifestyle. The internationalist course of the Soviet state's politics coincided with the long established trend of interethnic interaction and was loyally received by the population. The polyethnicity of this region may be called positive, as it is characterised by interethnic tolerance and consent of peoples. The specificity of Buryatia's polyethnicity is that its core is two ethnoses: Russians and Buryats. Interethnic tolerance and consent are among the causes of Buryaria's attractiveness for contemporary migrants from post-Soviet countries. Although, in general, migrants' well-being in the republic and interaction with local residents is assessed as positive, there is some difference in the perception of newcomers, on the one hand, by old residents, especially indigenous townspeople belonging to older age groups adapted to racial and ethnic otherness since Soviet times, and, on the other hand, by local residents of the first generation and rural residents. The latter socialized in the post-Soviet period and are fully experiencing the difficulties of living in a remote, subsidized, economically and socially non-prosperous, or simply poor, republic; they do not have much experience of communicating outside their habitual environment of ethnic groups dominating in the republic; for them visitors from afar are sometimes the "visible ethnic Others". Due to factors of an objective nature, visitors from the countries of Central Asia, the Caucasus, and, possibly, some republics of southern Russia, in the near future can make up a more noticeable part of the inhabitants of Buryatia. With such a forecast, much depends on the level of public administration in the country and the region, and, of course, on the preservation of the traditional positive polyethnicity of Buryatia.

AB The article presents the outcomes of an empirical study of power and leadership in local communities. The study was conducted in 2011-2015 and 2018-2020 in three small towns and one district in three regions of Russia. The basic material was obtained in the course of 86 in-depth face to face interviews with the regional public officials and experts, local politicians, officials, businessmen, and civic activists. We studied opinions of local elites about local leadership. Who should be a leader in a local community, can he overcome the problems caused by objective circumstances, what is the role played by his team, etc. The study shows that the inclusion of the municipalities in the "power vertical" built in the last decade did not lead to an underestimation of the role of leadership by local elites. Leaders are still in demand both by communities and elites. The majority of representatives of urban elites, as the study has shown, believe that the head of the town is, first of all, a leader, and secondarily - an executor, realizing the will of higher authorities. Only real leaders of urban communities have a chance to successfully overcome adverse situations. The leader's power and the effectiveness of his activities are largely depend on the presence or absence of a professional and motivated group of followers - a team of like-minded people who support the leader and ensure the implementation of his policies. The study showed that in all local communities there are problems with the formation of a team, mainly due to the limited human resources of a small town. Many our respondents are quite optimistic about the leadership potential of town heads and their ability to influence the current situation. They emphasize that only leaders, not just executives really have a chance to significantly influence the situation.

ID EQUALITY
AB Introduction. This article investigates the universal power of socioeconomic rights assessing their theoretical conceptualization and practical implication. Methods. Taking theoretical and empirical research into account - at the level of public ethics and political theory - the article carries out a comparative analysis of the elements of global economic justice theory, moral universalism and institutional understanding of human rights of Thomas Pogge and the critical theory of political and social justice and the moral constructivist conception of human rights of Rainer Forst. Analysis. On the one hand, Pogge's cosmopolitan approach underlines serious non-compliance of socioeconomic rights at the global level because of the unjust distribution of rights and duties enforced by the current global institutional order. In this vein, the protection of socioeconomic rights is conceived as a (moral) negative duty not to deprive people of secure access to a basic human rights object, and socioeconomic rights, by imposing upon them unjust coercive social institutions. On the other hand, Forst's perspective maintains that each right needs to be constructed on the very basic moral right to reciprocal and general justification which is conceived as the most universal and basic claim of every human being. Results. Drawing on the above-mentioned outlooks on socioeconomic rights, the universal power of socioeconomic rights is assessed in light of the satisfaction of universal basic needs, whose object is also the object of socioeconomic rights - a cconditio sine qua non' for a worthwhile life - and the justification of the assigned duties at the global level.

DE Old Belief; Old Belief in Tuva; religious community; Tuva; mass media;
   The Tuvan Pravda; history of Tuva; Soviet period; external
   representation; history of mass media
AB The article focuses on materials on Old Belief in Tuva published in the local press from 1924 to late 1980s. Due to their ideological bias and prejudiced reporting of facts, Soviet regional newspapers have rarely been used by scholars of Old Belief as sources of information. In this article we study the newspapers of Soviet Tuva with our focus shifted from the information on the community to modes of its representation. This will help us discover new analytical perspective and avoid flat and straightforward interpretation.
   Our study traces both quantitative (such as the frequency of mentioning Old Believers in the media in various years) and qualitative (the materials' content, stereotypes, ideological bias, rhetorical devices, visual content, etc.) The article also presents a model of external representation of one of Tuva's confessional groups in its interaction with other population.
   In the press, the cultural features of this group were presented through an ideological lens, with Old Believers shown mostly in the negative light, as a periphery and marginal community, which reflected their status in society. Depending on the agenda, this light could be varied, but variation stayed within the strictly atheistic approach. In the early years of the Soviet regime Old Believers were primarily portrayed as its political opponents, with their religious identity enhancing their status as social and class enemies. Later, the confrontation shifts into the sphere of ideological rivalry where the Old Believers are constructed through binary oppositions of science v. prejudice, progressive v. backward, collectivism v. individualism. At times, Old Believers are not even seen as a religious community: they get dissolved in the mass of Soviet working class and only appear on the pages of Soviet newspapers as participants of "Socialism-building"

The key branding campaigns of the two states were studied, which, in turn, allowed identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the national brands in these countries. Based on the comparison, the features of the formation of the international images of Germany and Russia were determined. The relevance of this article is in increasing the role of soft power tools in the development of information technology and a multipolar world. The aim of the study is to examine the features of the formation of the international image of the state using the concept of national branding. The methodological basis of the study was comparative analysis, systemic analysis, problem-chronological and structural-functional methods, case studies. The empirical basis of the article is official sources containing information on campaigns of national branding of states, as well as various analytical materials, including ratings, indexes, statistical observations and publications of leading domestic and foreign researchers of national branding. The analysis of key branding campaigns made it possible to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the national brands of Germany and Russia, and thus discover a number of patterns in the successful and effective promotion of the national brand of the state: 1) when forming the national brand of the country, it is necessary to emphasize the most promising competitive identities, including in the field of industry; 2) the concept of national branding identifies the most exclusive export brands of the state; 3) the most successful branding campaigns to form and promote the country's national brand are timed to coincide with mass international sports events. The national branding strategy is a special tool for the international positioning of states, which can ensure the recognition and fame of the country's national brand, strengthen the global subjectivity of the state on the world stage, ensure the expansion of international political and economic cooperation, attract investment, improve socioeconomic indicators, which in the future can significantly improve the quality of life of the country's population.

DE Russian-Japanese relations; Japanese intervention; Civil War in Siberia;
   A.V. Kolchak government; anti-Japanese sentiment
AB The article is devoted to the problems of the history of the Japanese intervention in the territory of Russia. Japan's participation in foreign military intervention became a major factor in the development of Soviet-Japanese relations and it largely determined the anti-Japanese sentiments among Russians at different stages of the country's history. Although there is an extensive historiography of the issue, many problems in the history of Japanese military intervention in eastern Russia remain poorly understood. The aim of this work is to reveal the problems in the relations between the A.V. Kolchak government and Japan. The content and nature of the assistance of the Japanese interventionists to the authorities and the army in Siberia determined the outcome of the civil war in Russia. On the basis of archival documents and materials from periodicals, the historical picture of the relationship of the Omsk government with the state and the military of Japan is being restored. Vice-Admiral A.V. Kolchak tried to obtain material assistance from the Japanese government for his struggle against the Bolsheviks in the summer of 1918. Japan established direct relations with the government in Omsk in the autumn of 1918, when Japanese troops were already stationed along the railways from Vladivostok to Irkutsk. The work identifies and analyzes the issues and problems that existed in relations between the central anti-Soviet government of Russia and the Japanese interventionists in 1918-1920. Insufficient material support and Japan's refusal to send troops to Western Siberia and the Urals devalued the allies' assistance to the White movement. Japanese troops actively fought the partisan movement in the Far East, but avoided not only direct confrontation with the armed forces of the RSFSR, but also active intervention in the military and political events in Central and Western Siberia. This ultimately formed a negative attitude towards the Japanese intervention among various political forces and social groups. A comprehensive study of the history of the Japanese intervention provides a deeper understanding of the reasons for the continued negative perception of Japan's participation in the events of the civil war and foreign military intervention in Russia in 1918-1922.

This article aims to disclose the concept of modern language and educational technologies and consider the critical figure - the teacher's personality. The research method is the analysis and synthesis of the theoretical basis on the issue of language and educational technologies and the role of a teacher in the educational process. Based on the study's results, it can be concluded that any language and educational technology that is introduced into the educational process can be integrated precisely through a highly qualified and competent teacher.

   complexity theory; transregionalism; complex interdependence
AB The paper is dedicated to the key methodological problems of international and regional studies and the prospects for the formation of a unified, "seamless" methodology. The author's reflections are illustrated by examples from the collective monograph, ed. by Alexei D. Voskressenski "The Logic of the New World Architectonics and the Strategies of the Powers" (2021).
   At the first stage, the question of the levels of analysis in international studies is investigated with a special emphasis on the systemic level, as well as the practical difficulties of decomposition of international political situations, taking into account the high density of social ties. The applied value of network analysis and event analysis is shown. The phenomenon of transregionalism, which is of great importance for international economic relations, is considered from a network point of view. Methodological tools for the analysis of trans-regional institutions are presented as well. Much attention is paid to the organismic concept of the general theory of the system and its adaptation to the IR system. The practical use of this concept in organizing situational analyzes of international processes is shown. The regional level of analysis and the place of the "middle-level powers" in the world system are revealed through the prism of an agent-structural "matryoshka" (nested model) - agent-structural problem at different levels of analysis. The limits and possibilities of application of the complexity theory in the analysis of IR are explored. Special attention is paid to the concept of complex interdependence of R. Keohane and J. Nye, which, according to the author, adequately reflects modern IR and is the key to understanding the formation of zones of influence of great powers in world politics.
   Finally, the work reveals the normative component of IR theory and shows an increasing popularity of non-Western IR theories in the last few years. The normativity in regional studies is explored as well and particular cases of the application of non-Western approaches in regional studies are shown. The necessity of integration of non-Western approaches to IR theory and regional research is declared.

TI IDEOLOGY IN THE ERA OF "CYNICAL REASON" INTERPRETATION OF IDEOLOGY IN
   SLAVOJ ZIZEK'S WORKS
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE ideology; cynical reason; Marxism; post-Marxism; Slavoj Zizek
AB The article is devoted to the critical analysis of the concept of ideology developed by Slavoj Zizek, the modern Slovenian philosopher. The author reveals the possibilities and limitations of Zizek's approach to understanding the phenomenon of ideology and considers the initial presumptions and methodological assumptions that this approach is based upon. The article shows that despite the indisputable originality, Zizek's theory is not devoid of contradictions, and the interpretation of ideology as an illusion and mystification, which is justified within the framework of Marxist political philosophy, loses its foundations in the context of the post-structuralist methodology.
   According to I.Demin's conclusion, Zizek's philosophical and political thinking falls prey to the scheme that Peter Sloterdijk defined as "mutual tracking of ideologies". Criticism of ideology here implies criticism of one ideology from the standpoint of another, or criticism of "bad" ideology from the standpoint of "good" ideology. The "criticizing" ideology is not clearly articulated, but implicitly assumed. The fact that the "critic" of ideology prefers not to reveal his own bias constitutes an integral part of the strategy of ideological criticism, as opposed to scientific criticism.
   Ideology as the principle that structures social reality obtains an all-encompassing character in Zizek's interpretation, since it underlies all human actions and human thinking. However, if there is no way to separate ideology from scientific knowledge, to distinguish between ideology, philosophy and religion, it turns out that ideology is everything and nothing at the same time. With this interpretation, "ideology" becomes an unoperationalizable concept for Social and Political Sciences, and therefore useless. At the same time, a number of the provisions formulated by Zizek (on ideological "fastening", on the role of the enemy figure in the ideological discourse, etc.) may be in high demand in the course of developing an adequate methodological strategy for studying the phenomenon of ideology, which distances itself from both "naive" objectivist doctrines and the extremes of the political anti-essentialism and anti-universalism.

AB Purpose: The purpose of the study is to explicate the concept of economic balance and sustainable development in the problem field of the philosophy of science, interdisciplinary knowledge, and the interface of system paradigms in the evolution of economic theory. Methodology: The key research method is the system paradigm. At the same time, the system paradigm has degrees of gradation that lead to different epistemological results. Findings: Indicators of system balance in the mechanistic and organic interpretations of economic life are Revealed. It is concluded that political economy is relevant for the classical explanation of certain types of supercomplicated economic States. Special attention is paid to ontological situations described by non-classical science, when the phenomenon of balance is revealed through the interaction of subject and system meanings. The authors project the system doctrine of N. Luman on the desired subject area of economic theory. To explicate the phenomenon of economic balance, the system-system and system-external environment relations are conceptualized. Put forward the position that current trends of economic growth and sustainable development involve three types of States economic system (national economy), with indicators of intersystem interactions (Economics of law, Economics of education, etc.) with the state of the environment (geopolitical controversies, global processes). Originality: The Originality of the author's concept is to identify the subjective and objective meanings of economic balance. For this purpose, economic behavior and systemic institutional effects are considered within the framework of non-classical and post-non-classical philosophical and scientific thinking.

DE ideology; semiotics of culture; semiotics of ideology; cultural
   anthropology of Clifford Geertz; linguistic turn
AB The article reveals the significance of the cultural anthropology of Clifford Geertz for the modern theory of ideologies. It analyzes the general philosophical premises and the sociophilosophical context of the cultural-semiotic approach to understanding ideology. Geertz's main arguments against the dominant (post-Marxist and structuralist) interpretations of the phenomenon of ideology are analyzed. Geertz's interpretation of ideology is based on a semiotic understanding of culture as a set of extragenetic programs that govern the behavior of a human as a "symbolic animal". In the context of Geertz's cultural anthropology, aspects of ideology that remained undisclosed in the framework of other research programs (structuralist, neo-Marxist, post-Marxist) come to the fore. Ideology within the framework of the cultural-semiotic approach appears as a system of interrelated symbols and meanings that set an integral context for the interpretation of various phenomena of socio-political life. Ideology can be likened to a map of a problematic social reality. The cultural-semiotic approach rehabilitates ideology as a subject of social research and allows one to develop a nonjudgmental, non-ideologized concept of ideology. One of the main advantages of the cultural-semiotic approach in comparison with post-Marxist and post-Freudian research strategies is the consistent distinction between the scientific and ideological perspectives of the consideration of ideology. Geertz's interpretation convincingly shows that the scientific study of ideology cannot be reduced to the task of criticizing ideology, exposing it as "false consciousness" that distorts social reality. Ideology and social science within the framework of the cultural-semiotic approach are not opposed, but they are not identified either; they are viewed as different languages and special symbolic forms of culture existing in parallel for describing and explaining social reality.

AB The article is devoted to the problems of commemorating the events of the Patriotic War of 1812 in the Northern Caucasus in the year of the centenary. A wide range of archival and published sources is used to analyse the ways in which the image of victory in the war with Napoleon is formed in the region, and to trace the specifics of the imperial authorities' construction of the memory of the war and the involvement of all the peoples of the Russian Empire in this event. The specific nature of regional commemorative practices is revealed through a comparative analysis of the various political orientations of the central and regional press. Periodicals were the most responsive and reflected on their pages all actions of the authorities to implement the jubilee celebrations, the key objective of which was seen as the unification of the country's multi-ethnic and multi-confessional population. In the conditions of increasing social and inter-ethnic contradictions in the North Caucasus, as well as the significant militarisation of Russian celebrations in the early 20th century, the memory of the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812 was to become a certain assemblage point for the imperial state under the conditions of instability. An analysis of the reporting documents on the celebrations in the North Caucasus in comparison with the materials of the periodical press made it possible to identify the possibilities and limits of the use of the jubilee date in this process.

TI Theoretical approaches to international relations in Japan
SO JAPANESE STUDIES IN RUSSIA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Japan; IR; realism; liberalism; world system; human security; culture
AB The article examines some aspects of the evolution of Japanese theoretical approaches to international relations (IR). A brief description of intellectual currents and concepts characteristic of the IR studies in the pre-war period is given, and their development after 1945 is considered as well. Japanese theoretical approaches to international relations mainly originate from Western schools of philosophy, political science, and law, but national peculiarities are traced in them. Western theories selectively lay on Japanese soil, and while some of them were further developed in the works of Japanese scholars, others, on the contrary, did not arouse much interest. In general, we can say that, under the influence of Western thought and Japanese traditions, distinctive concepts emerged in Japan. Japanese approaches to IR have evolved simultaneously with the conceptual rethinking of the surrounding world and Japan's place in it, as well as its national identity. A feature of Japanese approaches to IR is the emphasis on their economic and cultural aspects, as well as the promotion of concepts that could ensure the global leadership of Japan as a non-military power. One can note the interest in the applied aspects of the IR theories, which make it possible to substantiate certain foreign policy goals. In general, theoretical approaches to IR tend more towards finding answers to specific questions than to abstract constructions. This reflects the peculiarities of the Japanese mentality and the characteristic features of Japanese political culture.

AB The work is devoted to the 10th-13th-century paleodemographic data regarding the city of Chernigov and its districts, and to their introduction into the scientific domain. The study is based on the data on the anthropological series of Chernigov in the 10th-13th centuries, divided into three samples according to the topographic principle. This series is characterized by a low average life expectancy in comparison to other southern Old Rus cities. The feature of the necropolises of Chernigov indicating the predominance of female burials over male ones, revealed in the 1980s, has been confirmed at a new level. A study of the demographic parameters of the Chernigov population groups in the 10th-13th centuries, united on a territorial basis, has shown differences in their structure, probably reflecting the peculiarities of the life quality, social status, and professional specialization of the population of different parts of the city. Further research into the remains of the city's population with methods of paleopathology, osteometry, osteoscopy, radiology, etc., as well as the analysis of aspects of the political history of the region, would help shed light on the possible causes of the identified features of the demographic structure of the population in the pre-Mongolian period.

DE fear; freedom; Kierkegaard; Dostoevsky
AB Baudrillard showed that the peculiarity of a consumer society is that it consumes itself being a society of consumers. In this atmosphere, the Christian values that determined the foundation of European and Russian societies turn out to be harmful and dangerous. The question arises and urgently demands an answer: what can bring a person back to oneself? The experience of the awareness of fear, which is one of the most important conditions for spiritual movement of a person to oneself, as it is presented in the works of Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, is the object of analysis in the article. Kierkegaard initially distinguishes between two types of fear: 1) fear defined by specific circumstances, and 2) fear devoid of rational explanations. In his analysis, Kierkegaard relies on the Old Testament texts. He speaks of the existential fear that Christ experienced and that no human being can experience. This is the ultimate fear and ambivalent at the same time - it is obviously present, and its presence is realized, but it is causeless, and awareness slips without any possibility of finding at least some support, and in this sense it is fundamentally unconscious. Only a Christian can approach the true fear - the fear of falling away from God. The analysis of this situation allows Kierkegaard to distinguish the degrees of fear inherent not exclusively in a Christian, but in any person. Dostoevsky, unlike Kierkegaard, has no special works devoted to fear. Yet the feeling of fear and the corresponding plots are elaborated in detail by Dostoevsky in a number of works, the first of which is The Hostess. Here Dostoevsky analyzes the fear that turns a person to a slave, absolutely dependent on one's fear, no matter whether it is real or fantastic. Here is also the first approach to the inquisitor's question of freedom. In addition, an important motif appears here - the powerful contagion of a certain feeling, fear in this case. The article describes the shades and types of fear presented by the writer in Notes from the Dead House, The Idiot, The Adolescent, and other works. Ultimately, both Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky offer the same thing to the consumer - an appeal to Christian values. A person without God is not able to find support in oneself to overcome fear, but can only move away from oneself, losing one's inner freedom and finding oneself in the arms of the Leviathan built by the inquisitor.

AB The relevance of the study is due to the low degree of study of the revisionist historian R. W. Van Olsteen views in historiography. The purpose of the article is to concretize the scientist's views on the genesis of US foreign policy. The scientific novelty of the work lies in the creation of a conceptual framework for the intellectual biography of the researcher and determination of his assessment of the emergence of the United States foreign policy. The methodological complex of research consists of two levels: the first includes the principles of historicism. objectivity. consistency, the second - historical-chronological, historical-biographical, descriptive and prosopographic methods. A tendentiousness in the concept of the scientist is established in the article: throughout his career, he debunked the myth of American uniqueness. In this context. R. W. Van Olsteen considered the emergence of US foreign policy, which he associated exclusively with the British experience. It is proved that initially the scientist based his assessment on political realism (late 1930s - mid 1940s); and in a later period - a synthesis of history, political science and psychology (late 1940s - 1960s). The author revealed the failure of the historian's theoretical developments and established the secondary nature of his assessment of the emergence of US foreign policy. The research results are focused on their application in the study of the history of the North American state.

AB Introduction. The aim of the work was to analyze the leading directions of interaction between the state and religious authorities in the modern public space. It is shown that the result of this interaction was the politicization of the Russian Orthodox Church (hereinafter ROC). It is proved that in recent decades the Church continues to exert direct and indirect influence on the state, which, in turn, uses its spiritual potential to stabilize the socio- political system. Methods and materials. Institutional and modernization approaches were used as the research methodology. Within the framework of the institutional approach, an analysis of the interaction of government structures and the ROC in the context of adaptation, cooperation and competition in the course of democratic transformations in the country was carried out. Within the framework of the modernization approach J. Haber formulates the fundamental thesis on the increasing role of religion in a secular (modernizing) society and its strengthening in the national state. Analysis. It is noted that in the 1990s the leading direction of interaction between the state and the ROC was exclusively the political sphere, which was associated with the democratization of public life, the involvement of the clergy in political modernization. At the beginning of the 21st century the state proclaimed a course towards depoliticizing the institution of religion. The activities of political religious parties were prohibited. Subsequently, the ruling United Russia party began to focus on mutually beneficial partnership with the ROC, priority was given to the patriotic education of young people. The result of joint activities of the Main Military-Political Directorate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the ROC was the formation of a new type of soldier, a bearer of spiritual and moral values, a statesman, defender of the Fatherland. The ROC, as the dominant religious figure in the public space, actively participates in the domestic and foreign policy of the country, challenging other confessional structures. The highest officials of the state and the church share the common values of conservatism, but at the same time, each of them defends its own interests, which initiates the limitation of their mutual support. Results. The state power, together with the ROC, solves internal political problems, including the formation of spiritual, moral, patriotic constants in modern Russian society. In the context of the sanctions policy, the activity of the ROC as a conductor of the "soft power" of the state contributes to the improvement of the countrys image. The result of the interaction of state and religious structures is the formation of a new ideological paradigm based on the principles of religious ethics, conservative values, as well as national identity, patriotism.

AB The paper considers the problems that arose during the implementation of the multiculturalism policy in countries situated in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand with a multinational population. Multiculturalism is becoming the basis of state policy, as it integrates and adapts the minority and majority into a single community while emphasizing and preserving ethnic, linguistic, and confessional identity. The authors identify four key socio-political cases of multiculturalism: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Scandinavian Peninsula, which reflect the modern results of the multiculturalism policy. The paper notes that the policy of multiculturalism of these countries consolidates concerning the "indigenous peoples" the official status of the ethnic minority and the language of indigenous peoples within the framework of the main state legislative acts. It is concluded that their models of multicultural development are the most appropriate for multinational Russian states.

AB The socio-psychological characteristics of the behavior of the Russian military in Finland in the initial period of the 1917 revolution were revealed. including the formation of behavioral stereotypes. new "images of the enemy". a change in their ideas about "friends" and "foes". and the transformation of social and moral norms. The relevance of the study is due to the need to apply a relatively new historical and anthropological approach to the study of the role of the military factor in the history of Russia and Finland. Based on the materials of the revolutionary Helsingfors and non-capital garrisons. the process of ideological and organizational self-determination of the supporters or the Socialist-Revolutionary and Bolshevik parties is considered. information about the number and the beginning of the activities of these party organizations is systematized and analyzed. The novelty of the research is seen in the fact that addressing the problem of "Revolution and man" and studying the images of "Friends", "Foes", "Other" in the perception of participants and eyewitnesses of events in connection with their participation in social transformations of a revolutionary time allows for the first time to get an idea of the mentality of privates and officers - the most active part of the Russian population of Finland. The author comes to the conclusion that the role of the Russian military in the events of the spring of 1917 is much more significant than was previously assumed.

Germany was a kind of filter through which Russia got acquainted with European literature. Images of the German world, reflected in the Russian literature, arose not least due to the personal experience of Russian writers with Germany and the Germans. In this regard, Germany often acquired its special significance in the life and work of Russian writers. This will be discussed in this article.

TI AN UNOCCUPIED PLACE: THEORETICAL EMULATIONS OF THE SUBJECT
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE subject; transcendental program; criticism; condition of possibility;
   seriality; place
AB More than thirty years ago, Jean-Luc Nancy was urged by his American and Italian colleagues to invite several French philosophers to address "post-subjectivity" in a special issue of the journal Topoi entitled "Who comes after the subject?" What Nancy's colleagues provided was not in the end so much a deconstruction of the subject, but more a critique and, of course, a reflection on the conditions that make the question itself possible. The question as stated was ambiguous: it could be read in the spirit of deconstruction, and the answers made to it would then be various options for a non-subjective reconfiguration; or it could be interpreted as a forecast or even a hidden threat. In any case, "Who comes after the subject?" is to be read as relevant to the future, an invitation to prognosticate and an opening up of perspective. What conceptual movement are we making when we think about "conditions of possibility," that is, when we produce a critique in accordance with the precepts of the Kantian transcendental method?
   The "condition of possibility" is a principle of seriality, a movement in search of the conditions of conditions; hence, the critical maneuver can be performed indefinitely. But there is a logically possible alternative to a "condition of possibility" if we change the terms of the search from conditions of conditions to the possibility of possibility. To think of the "unoccupied place" of a subject means that the attempt is not working with the category itself, but instead with its conceptual context because the category itself can be interpreted as a presence. The thinking in the issue of Logos introduced by this article represents a slice of modern speculative, theoretical, hermeneutic work neither in the tradition of transcendentalism nor explicitly outside it, but alongside it. At the same time, some of the efforts being proposed are devoted to classical topics and problems of the conceptual field in question (the historical subject, capabilities, action), and some others demonstrate how the problems of the transcendental tradition are projected onto political theory, sociology and cybernetics.

AB This article is devoted to the scholarly work of the prominent Russian historian Igor Iakovlevich Froianov who died last December. He is a brilliant representative of the Petersburg Historical School, and first and foremost - a well-known specialist in the history of so called Kievan Rus. He created a complex concept of the "obcshinno-vechevaia" civilization of Old Rus. His concept is ultimately comprehensive because he studied in consecutive order practically all sides of such a phenomenon as Kievan Rus: economy, political life, social struggle, culture. His concept emerged in confrontation with the prevalent Soviet vision of this history, and at the same time from the very beginning it became a creative continuation and development of pre-revolution historiography. He also devoted several interesting and important works to the period of Moscow Rus, particularly to the process of formation of the Russian monarchy. These works made an excellent foundation for the new original view of this epoch of the Russian history, different from other concepts. Froianov's legacy is divided into two parts: before and after the middle of the 1990s when so called "perestroika" took place in the USSR. On the one hand, he continued to study the old time. On the other hand, a number of his later works are devoted to the history of Russian revolution (1917) and to the above-mentioned "perestroika". These works are closely connected with a publicistic genre which captivated him in those years. However, it is to a certain extent a continuation of his previous interests as these works are dedicated to the same Russian-Orthodox Civilization.

AB The so-called travelogues, that is, "notes" ("legends") of foreigners about the Russian state, are considered. The main attention is paid to the representation in these literary works of the spatial representations or their authors in connection with the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (the Lithuanian-Russian slate). The relevance or the study is due to the lack of demand for travelogues, despite the fact that they found themselves in the field of vision of large, sometimes famous historians. Another aspect or relevance is shown - the topicality of the study or the Grand Duchy of Lithuania itself and the travelogues, as such. The results of a comparative analysis of the spatial perception system of the Grand Duchy or Lithuania by the authors of travelogues up to the famous "Notes" by Sigismund Herberstein are presented. In this regard, first of all, the idea of the relationship between "Lithuania", "Russia" and "Muscovy" in the geographical space of Eastern Europe is analyzed. It is concluded that the spatial representations of those who traveled through these territories or wrote on the basis of available information changed over time, reflecting, albeit in a distorted form, the complex processes of socio-political and ethnic development that took place in Eastern Europe. where the so-called Kievan Rus', there were new, young states: the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Russia, which actually grew up on the same ethnic basis.

TI Mutual historical accusations between the DPRK and Japan
SO JAPANESE STUDIES IN RUSSIA

DE abductions issue; collective memory; comfort women; DPRK; Japan;
   relations between North Korea and Japan; Tokto
AB International relations in Northeast Asia are particularly attuned to fluctuations of collective memory and the parties' evolving perception of their common past. In the past 70 years Tokyo and Pyongyang have failed to establish official ties, and historical differences became a major point of contention. After Korea was liberated and later divided, Japan and the DPRK found themselves in different political 'camps', which exacerbated Pyongyang's distrust of its former oppressor. Normalization talks of the 1990s had a rough start since the parties found it difficult to settle the issues of apologies and compensations for decades of colonial rule. The long-awaited summits in the early 2000s failed to bring a diplomatic breakthrough. Japanese society was enraged at North Korea's admission that Pyongyang was responsible for abductions of Japanese citizens in the 1970-1980s. This confirmation and the media's efforts to politicize the issue solidified support for the nationalists, who later came to power and cut all of Japan's loose ties with the North.
   In the realms of public consciousness and politics, this relatively new issue has taken the place usually reserved for matters of troubled history. The discourse on abductions helps nationalists garner support. It also contributes to forming collective political identity vis-a-vis an external enemy, and provides the public a respite from constant accusations from former colonies by letting them try on the victim's shoes for once. The methods used to promote Japan's view (a peculiar union between NGOs and the government) and their political results bring this issue closer to historical problems. The enraged public clamors for punishment for foreign perpetrators and rejects any diplomatic compromise (which would have actually helped to resolve the issue), and so the bilateral ties fall apart.
   North Korea's symmetrical response is also quite symptomatic: Pyongyang now constantly criticizes Japan, bringing up all its 'wrongdoings' from modern times back to the Middle Ages. Northeast Asia is troubled enough even without historical differences, with the threat of military conflict always looming on the horizon. That is why it is very concerning to see how both allies and opponents are eager to exploit nationalistic sentiments for short-term political gain.

AB The article presents an outline of the biography and the main phases of the scientific, political and teaching activities of Charles E. Merriam (1874-1953), setting the stage for the publication of the Russian translation of his work The Present State of the Study of Politics (1921). The author examines Merriam's contribution to the development of Political Science in the United States, primarily his New Science of Politics program, aimed at achieving a new quality of political research and teaching discipline, which should not be confined to the narrow framework of purely theoretical reflection. According to Merriam, only the update of methodological tools (in particular, widely borrowing methods from natural sciences, especially biology), productive interaction with other branches of knowledge and a general reorientation to systematic expert support of public administration can ensure the transformation of Political Science into a truly scientific discipline.
   The article analyzes the role of Merriam in the formation of the Chicago School of Political Studies, his participation in providing expertise to the public administration, including F.D.Roosevelt's New Deal. The article demonstrates that, being a product of its time, the canonical text of Merriam has not lost its relevance today, stimulating a new understanding of the criteria for the scientific nature of political knowledge and touching on a number of issues that are still acute for modern political scientists.

The authors come to the conclusion that in the conditions of growing social-economic and political international relations and getting more authority by sovereign states and national institutions nationalism is growing too. This process is a natural reaction to the threat to loose their national identity and the rise of nationalism continues to be a discussion point of modern nationalists project and movements.

AB Ever since the 1920 Treaty of Trianon there have been sizable Hungarian minorities found in countries neighbouring the modern Hungarian state. Since the fall of authoritarian communist regimes and the rise of political plurality these minorities have sought representation, often through minority parties. This lens of political parties is applied in this article, in order to examine the seeking of representation by the Hungarian ethnic minority in Serbia and Slovakia. The overall development of parties is outlined, the stages of their development is illustrated and each stage is analysed in detail. The main findings are that Hungarian minority representation is incredibly fragmented and dogged by conflict in both countries, involving many splits in parties, with the formation and liquidation of parties common. However, during exceptional times they were able to show a united front to nationalist governments, this was observed in both Slovakia and Serbia. In more recent times conflict has returned to the fore, with the situations somewhat divergent. The high level of conflict within those seeking to offer political representation to the Hungarian minority in Serbia was notable, as was a lack of an end in sight. On the other hand, there were attempts to unite made in Slovakia, although they are yet to experience much success.

AB This review characterises the content and comments on the importance of a collective monograph which can be regarded as the first comprehensive work in the Russian historical science to depict the dynamics of political culture and the stages of party building by almost all the peoples of the multinational Habsburg monarchy in 1848- 1914. In a series of essays, the authors demonstrate how Habsburg peoples fought, though with a varying degree of ardour and success, for the recognition of their collective identity and claimed to be recognised as collective subjects of the state. The review reveals the main issues that thwart drawing a comprehensive review of the political culture of the peoples of the monarchy resulting from the composite state structure, the nature of political associations and parties, and the different development stages of the national idea. The authors revise the teleological approach of 20th-century historiography which can be considered a novelty in the Central European studies in Russia. Yet, the book contains occasional weaknesses in the chains of reasoning and evidence. Nonetheless, the strengths of the book make it possible to rank it among the authoritative books on the Central European history of the modern period.

   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE E.N. Trubetskoy; university question; student unrest; Russia in the
   early Twentieth Century
AB This paper aims to analyse the role of Prince E.N. Trubetskoy [Troubetzkoy; Trubetzkoy] in the discussion of university education during the period from 1901 to 1910. The scholar's views on the universities' autonomy and students' rights as well as the right- and left-wingers' reaction to E.N. Trubetskoy's public uttering were studied based on the materials from the periodicals of the time and on archival documents from the Russian State Library's Department of Manuscripts. This issue was not the subject of a special study, although the presented materials show that E.N. Trubetskoy was one of the active fighters for the democratisation of higher education, but with the preservation of the inspections' institute. He was an exponent of the views of Constitutional Democrats who believed that the government's crisis could be overcome by raising the level of the population's education. The article shows that the University Regulation of 1884 by the beginning of the 20th century, it was at odds with public sentiment, so the Ministry of Public Education repeatedly raised the question of the need to make changes to this document. The inevitability of updating the University system became obvious after the wave of student strikes that swept through in 1901. E.N. Trubetskoy, Professor at the Kiev University of St. Vladimir, in 1901 expressed his own opinion about the University autonomy, which, in his opinion, should not have become uncontrolled. The supersession of the Ministers of Public Education and students riots that swept the country prevented further advancement in the tackling of the long-pending university issue. In 1908, the university community once again got back to the discussion of draft Regulation proposed by the Minister of Public Education, A.N. Shvarts. Shvarts' draft Regulation focused on suppressing the university liberties and strengthening the controlling functions of university inspectors. By this time, E.N. Trubetskoy's views had become more liberal: he advocated expanding the powers of the university councils and the corporate rights of students. E.N. Trubetskoy's ideas about the "University question" were not accepted by both right and left political forces, which was expressed in active criticism of his views on the pages of newspapers and even in cartoons. Perhaps the reason for the beginning of the persecution of the Prince by the students was the widespread distribution among them of representatives of the Social Democrats, who demanded that the power of the Professor's Corporation be replaced by student self-government. The situation became so heated that the government versions of university charters never got round to be approved by the State Duma while the Imperial universities continued to operate and cope with the riots and commotions on the part of revolutionary-minded students.

AB The article assesses the degree of media corporations' influence on modern political processes. The empirical basis of the study was formed by monitoring the functioning of popular network platforms (Twitter, Google, Facebook, etc.) during the US presidential campaign in 2020. The totality of the observations the author made suggests that Internet resources have moved into a qualitatively new state for themselves: if earlier they served as channels of communication between political actors, now they have began to directly influence the distribution and redistribution of power. At the same time, their ideological tendentiousness and political engagement have become obvious. IT corporations pursue their power ambitions by promoting the electoral success of candidates and parties that provide them with political patronage. For this, a set of manipulative technologies is used. It includes blocking accounts and restricting access to certain content, labeling objectionable publications as "fake news" or "potentially dangerous" materials, public denial of statements of political bloggers, setting up search algorithms so that they produce pre-programmed results, automatic recommendation of certain materials for viewing, artificial pessimization of ideologically alien content, termination of technical support for applications and services used by political opponents, abuse of access to personal data of clients. The author comes to the conclusion that, during the 2020 US presidential campaign, there was a clear tendency for IT corporations to acquire full-fledged political subjectivity. They can use their information and communication potential to influence the electoral processes. Seeking maximum personalization and emotional saturation of their content, social media platforms indirectly contribute to the ideological polarization and radicalization of the masses. However, the main problem is that the functioning of popular video hosting sites, search engines, aggregators, and social networks does not fit into the framework of traditional political institutions. At the moment, they, de facto, are quasi-state formations, the territory of which is the Internet space. These "virtual states" have their own ethical and legal norms, which are often inconsistent with national and international legislation. Accordingly, the need for finding effective mechanisms that can bring the information policy of media corporations in line with the standards, which will be developed by the legitimate authorities, is becoming urgent.

AB The article focuses on redefining the social genesis of ressentiment. The concept of ressentiment, widely used today in the form shaped by Friedrich Nietzsche and fine-grained by Max Scheler, turns out to be both overly and insufficiently connected to the social structure of the societies, for the analysis of which it is used. The reason is that although Nietzsche's and Scheler's ideas about ressentiment refer to the socio-structural aspects of its genesis, they do so in a contradictory and incorrect manner. Without noticing their own contradictions, both thinkers elevate genesis of ressentiment to the moral standards of the lower classes. Using the examples of younger heirs and bastards of the medieval aristocratic families, as well as the examples of other relatively privileged social groups, the author shows that one should rather seek the genesis of ressentiment within higher social strata. At the same time, the author shows that the moral feelings and behavioral strategies germane to ressentiment can be adopted and are adopted by representatives of other classes. In this form, it attracts attention in times when the oppressed classes obtain real opportunities to change their position, or, at the very least, they receive reasons to believe that they could achieve more if such an opportunity had been given to them.

TI ZOMBIE OF BIOPOWER: IS THE CONCEPT OUTDATED?
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY

DT Article
DE biopower; biopolitics; necropolitics; zombie ideas; power; political

ID FOUCAULT; SCIENCE; POWER
AB The article is devoted to the discussion about what the concept of biopower, developed within the framework of the postmodern critical theory, means in the context of the modern world, both in general theoretical and empirical sense. According to the author's conclusion, although this concept remains significant for Political Science, it is largely outdated and could turn into a scientific zombie idea. Giorgio Agamben, one of the classics of Political Philosophy, who denied the danger of the COVID-19 pandemic on the basis of the methodology of biopolitics, is case in point. Another evidence comes from the fact that researchers from different countries, including Russia, increasingly look for new approaches and tools of the biopolitical analysis, and try to saturate the concept with new ideas and data.
   This article proposes three ways how to make biopolitical research more relevant today. One way is to rethink the normative/moral foundations of biopower, to reject an implicitly negative assessment of the concept. Another way is to expand the historical framework, to pay greater attention to historical cases that allow us to trace different stages of the evolution of biopolitical patterns, to focus on the analysis of specific manifestations of biopower in concrete situations. The third way is to move towards the synthesis of critical biopolitics and evolutionary biopolitics, which draws data from the natural sciences. According to the author, these efforts together will make it possible to move from the unidirectional asymmetric link "the political influences the biological" to a more complex scheme of mutual reflective influence of the political and the biological.

AB The main trends in the development of the English-language poetry of Kenya at the turn of the XX-XXI centuries are considered. The main material is a collection of poems by Kenyan poets, first published in the early 2000s. Particular attention is paid to the ideological and artistic transformation in the work of the young generation of Kenyan poets of the key directions in the development of Kenyan English-language poetry, which developed in the first half of the XX century. The novelty of the research lies in the conclusion about the continuity of the experience of the older generation poets by the English-speaking Kenyan poets, which is expressed in the development of two key directions of the development of Kenyan English-language poetry: socio-political and philosophical-lyric. At the same time, a fundamental change in the artistic method and style transformation is noted in the work of the new generation of Kenyan authors: unlike their predecessors, young Kenyan poets are increasingly gravitating towards the use of rhyme, expressed allegory and imagery, and also adopting previously untested techniques, for example, the use of elements of youth subculture. New material has been brought in, many names are first introduced into the everyday life of domestic and world African studies.

AB The analysis of interactions and mutual influence of Germany and the EU demonstrates a multidirectional causation of political and economical integration. Germany as the biggest European economy and the most influential political actor in EU plays a pivotal role in the Union defining the strategical and tactical approaches to political and economic matters. However, the robust German economy despite having a unique technical, scientifical and qualitative potential, is limited by a material resources base dependent on external partners. This factor determines relentless efforts of Germany to unite Europe which can be observed in chancellor A. Merkel's foreign policy actions. It is especially true under conditions of inevitable turbulence, caused by Brexit and the pandemic of coronavirus. Only a cohesive European Union can guarantee economic prosperity and political stability of Germany. Stabilization and development of internal policy of Germany are seen as its actions to consolidate EU.

DE Kazakhstan; political system; sustainability; stability; political
   system sustainability index
AB The problem of the sustainability of the political system is one of the most pressing issues in Political Science. The wave of social and political upheavals that took place in the 21st century in various countries requires studying the factors that determine the ability of modern political systems to maintain their essential features in case of undesirable conditions. Today it is already obvious that the sustainability of the political system, mechanisms and principles of its functioning depends not only and, perhaps, not as much on the socio-economic sphere, the development of democratic institutions or the presence/absence of a destructive external influence, as it is often assumed. Rather, intra-systemic characteristics play a key role.
   The multidimensionality of the manifestation and the multifactorial nature of the formation of stable political systems not only determine the possibility of a huge number of definitions of sustainability, but also give rise to considerable difficulties in measuring it.
   The authors analyze the political system of Kazakhstan using the sustainability index that they developed earlier. The study shows that throughout most of the post-Soviet history of the country, the level of the sustainability of its political system was above average, and now Kazakhstan already surpasses Russia and Ukraine in this parameter and is approaching Belarus. Moreover, if the existing trends continue, the sustainability of the political system of Kazakhstan in the short term will only increase. According to the authors' conclusion, this trend is hard to reverse unless there is a force majeure in the global economy or new military and political threats emerge, which the republic will not be able to tackle without resorting to the help of allies.

AB This work represents the views of the prominent Russian political scientists about the past and the future of Politeia. O.Gaman-Golutvina identifies several dimensions that together, from her point of view, define the face of Politeia and allow the journal to fulfill the mission of a development institution. A.Melville pays attention to the continuity and dynamics in the development of the journal and outlines a number of promising directions for its future. According to B.Makarenko, the main distinguishing feature of Politeia is that it has always been a community rather than just a journal. M.Ilyin draws attention to the meaning of the word pi omicron lambda iota tau epsilon iota alpha, which became the title of the journal, suggesting that it is this title that turned into a compass that allowed the journal to simultaneously focus on political philosophy and sociology of politics. R.Turovsky views Politeia as a mirror of the contemporary Russian politics and its evolution rather than just one of the leading Political Science journals in Russia. According to A.Akhremenko, the key feature of Politeia that sets it apart from other journals is a sense of balance, an equilibrium at the intersection of methods, problems and meanings. F.Aleskerov talks about Politeia's platform for publishing works on mathematical modeling in politics as one of the journal's advantages and delineates several thematic blocks within this area, which, in his opinion, should appear on the pages of the journal. O.Malinova draws attention to Salmin Award, established in 2005 in memory of A.Salmin, the journal's founder, considering this award one of the traditions that contributes to the development of the Russian professional community of political scientists.

AB The authors view the main issues raised in Charles Merriam's article The Present State of the Study of Politics in the context of the current trends in the development of political knowledge in Russia and worldwide. Merriam proposed a new view of Political Science as a scientific discipline with its own research goals related to the empirical study of the political behavior of people. Merriam's approach to determining the status of Political Science within the framework of social knowledge assumed delineating its own problem field and identifying those factors that determine events taking place in this field. Merriam emphasized the relativity of both the autonomy of politics and the significance of the impacts that are exerted upon politics.
   Professional organization and coordination of political studies (one of Merriam's key initiatives) at the beginning of the 21st century are associated with the competition between hierarchical and network models of interaction between representatives of the Political Science community. Moreover, the current state of discipline in Russia is largely determined by the specifics of its institutionalization. Unlike the United States, where the evolution of Political Science took place under the decisive influence of formalized knowledge, the Russian Political Science is still influenced by some of the approaches inherent in the old-fashioned institutionalism. The movement of Political Science in the direction of interdisciplinary synthesis, which received its impetus from the scientific and organizational activities of Merriam, was not linear. The current methodological configuration of the discipline is most adequately expressed in the concept of "multiparadigmality", which does not solve the problem of bringing together conflicting methodologies.

   neopragmatism; normal discourse; abnormal discourse; Habermas; Rorty
AB This work examines the options for understanding the problem of the foundations of knowledge and the conditions for obtaining rational knowledge in modern philosophy. Projects by Jurgen Habermas and Richard Rorty are under consideration. On the one hand, the works of these philosophers bear some conceptual similarities. Thus, both thinkers offer their own views on the problem of the role and place of philosophy in culture. In their reflections, they draw on the ideas of leading representatives of both analytic and continental philosophical traditions. However, despite the outward similarity, these thinkers express a different attitude to the problem of the conditions of rational knowledge. If Habermas continues to consider the problem of rationality constitutive for his philosophical search and calls for adapting it to the specifics of modern philosophical thinking, Rorty considers this problem a relic of classical epistemology and calls for refusing to pose this problem. It is concluded that the position of Habermas is more consistent and heuristic. Reflecting on the problem of the foundations of cognition, Rorty implicitly represents these very foundations as a set of extremely abstract principles shared by a certain community of researchers; from these principles, more particular propositions are derived. Rorty overlooks the fact that the question of the foundations and conditions of cognition is not aimed at identifying the fundamental provisions on which different ways of describing the world are based, but rather at explicating the conditions that make these very descriptions meaningful. In addition, Rorty points out that various dictionaries interact with each other, which implies the "hope of agreement" characteristic of any conversation. The question arises: what is the nature of this hope? Is it the question of normative expectation, which is present not only in communicative interaction within a certain linguistic community, but also in the interaction between different ways of describing the world? In the context of these issues, Habermas's position appears to be more consistent.

The geography of the study covers the the fortress city of Kizlyar and the adjacent villages, which formed the basis of the Terek cordon Line. The history of the arrangement of the Terskiy section of the Line begins from the moment of the construction of the Kizlyar fortress, until the abolition of the fortress in 1857. Until the 70s of the 18th century, the city administration was in charge of all issues - of an economic, military-political, cultural nature in the Caucasus. Military-political subordination was carried out by means of keeping amanats at the fortresses, military punitive operations. In the subsequent period, the vector of the Caucasian policy was replaced by civil colonization, as the most acceptable model for the colonization of the region.

DE poststructuralism; French philosophy; Foucault; classification
AB Firstly, the author observes that the term "poststructuralism" has some deficiencies, though it is largely used in behalf of the thought of the French philosophers Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, or Gilles Deleuze. It seems to be inappropriate or insufficient in relation to the ontological meanings of these different philosophers' works. Foucault himself wondered why scholars use this "label". To understand Foucault, this term is rather unnecessary. The French philosophical thought seems to be replaced by the so-called "French theory". The author does not elaborate this critical point. Secondly, the author postulates some methodological restrictions on the use of the term. Thirdly, he gives a categorical frame to the problematics viewed through poststructuralism. The main problem is the relationship between the social and the vital (G. Leblanc). Finally, the author offers a methodological order of research on the "poststructuralist" thought, from concepts, periods, authors to academic comparisons and heuristic applications. After this methodological introduction, the author tries to apply to this problem the methodology of classification elaborated in 1970 by the Soviet scholars Sergey Meyen and Juri Schreider for biology and linguistics. This classification means the possibility of natural classes. In this sense, the author argues that there is no hierarchy of philosophical thought and poststructuralism belongs to the level of meta-classification. The author remembers that Foucault himself, in his Order of Things, put the classification in question, saying there were two different types of classification in different periods of time: taxonomy and structural classification. The author calls this difference onto-ontic and thinks that there must be a post-classical, heuristic, and natural classification with two levels of analysis. The term of poststructuralism can belong to meta-classifications and the level of "meronomy" (Meyen) can be filled with such concepts as classical and modern epistemes, etc.

AB The paper proposes a technique for computer modeling of the formation of opinions and subjective values of people under the influence of interpersonal information contacts and various external factors. It is assumed that the studied society consists of a fixed number of individuals, each of whom has its own subjective attitude to a certain socially significant phenomenon. This ratio (position) can be expressed in a numeric scale of the interval type. A dynamic model is proposed in the form of a difference system of linear equations. The basis of the interpersonal contact model is a matrix, coefficients of which express the influence of the opinions of some individuals on the positions of others. The properties of these matrices are indicated, which provide stability of stationary states of estimation systems and facilitate forecasting. Based on the derived formulas, the forecast calculations were made on conditional data, which showed the effectiveness of the proposed procedures. At the model level, the possibilities of taking into account the influence of various external factors on opinions and assessments are considered. Such factors may include living conditions, natural conditions, media, political events, etc. It is emphasized that certain external factors can express controlling influences from certain social forces that have their own goals. A specific model of influence on electoral behavior is proposed, which aims to change the proportions of votes between several candidates. The paper considers the influence of random factors on the process of forming opinions. The formulas of estimates of variances and mathematical expectations for possible forecasts are given, and the corresponding calculations for the described model are performed. It is noted that the practical use of the described methods requires the availability of official statistics and serious sociological surveys.

AB Introduction. The study is devoted to the analysis of modern integration processes in the context of the state social policy implementation, taking the specifics of the public policy space in the macroregional dimension into account. The research problem is to clarify the optimal predictive scenarios for the development of the integration of public government institutions in the decision-making process aimed at the formation of social policy in the South of Russia. Methodology and methods. The study was conducted in the context of two methodological foundations (structural functionalism as interpreted by T. Parsons and M. Olson's theory of collective action). The choice of methodological tools is due to the presence of two components in the object of analysis - the functional process of implementing social policy and the communicative nature of institutional integration. Quantitative content analysis is used to clarify the priorities of the socio-political development of the southern Russia regions. The sources and materials of the study were official documents (strategies for the socio-economic development of the southern Russia regions), reports on the implementation of state programs, as well as materials of state statistics of the Russian Federation. Analysis. The modern political and communicative environment in Russia is characterized by the public sphere transformation in the context of constitutional changes and modernization reforms. Social policy is presented as a product that addresses a fundamental function - the achievement of social welfare. Regionalization of Russia determines the direction and form of communications regarding the implementation of social policy. At the same time, in the southern Russia regions, a positive practice of integration interaction is recorded in the form of the adoption of a fundamentally new document "social code", which unites many social practices. Results. Based on the results of the study, it was revealed that the existing practices of regional integration are based on replicating the best practices in the South of Russia. The formation of state social policy in the macro-regional dimension is based on the implementation of federal target programs and state projects. At the same time, each of the regions has its own request for the formation of social policy priorities, which allows them to be segmented into two groups: regions with existing infrastructure for the development of the social sphere, as well as regions that systematize the best practices of social project management in order to form their own development infrastructure.

AB The article aims to review and analyze the studies of service labor specifics in foreign sociology. Attention is focused on the emotional and semantic nature of work of the lower level of interactive service workers. Along with industrial workers, this group constitutes the new working class of post-industrial society. The definition of "emotional labor" by A.R. Hochschild and its further conceptualization in foreign sociology have been explicated. It is argued that a special type of "emotional work" required from ordinary employees transforms the value-semantic content of labor, the result and product of which is the success of service interaction. Special attention is paid to the gender dimension of emotional labor in the service sphere. Service researchers highlight the enormous role of gender in structuring public perceptions, demographics, and even ways of resisting those in the sector. Clients and managers share common stereotypes about employee representation of physicality and material attributes of role performance, which support the reproduction of racial and gender segregation. Interactive service work is characterized by specific attributes that are considered typically feminine in everyday consciousness, for example, submissiveness, helpfulness, and courtesy. These new behavioral standards challenge the model of hegemonic masculinity and become a factor that hinders the self- realization of young people in the new socioeconomic conditions. Based on the findings of empirical studies, it is shown that the subjective meaning of service work is directly related to the emotional repertoire of the roles played. Consequently, the value-semantic content is different for different types of service labor and may depend on a specific workplace. Resistance to dehumanization, instrumentalization and de-identification of their personality within the framework of the work process becomes a key aspect of the subjective life experience of service workers. This resistance is most often not expressed in an organized form, but manifests itself through alienation from the process and result of labor, as well as from their own emotions. The search for the meanings of such work is associated, as a rule, with the value of a permanent job, the development of vitality and firmness of character, for young people also with the process of growing up and gaining autonomy.

AB At the beginning of 2021, the Usmanov Center for Research of the Golden Horde and Tatar Khanates (Marjani Institute of History of Tatarstan Academy of Sciences) planned an international research conference: "Transformation of the Political and Ethnic Map of Eastern Europe". The main issues of the conference turned out to be very popular and relevant, and extremely numerous specialists expressed a desire to take part in it. Therefore, the organizers of the conference decided to hold the planned conference in the form of a triptych. The general picture of medieval political-ethnic transformations was successfully divided into three main formations: the Great Hungarians, Volga Bulghars, and Tatars of the Golden Horde.
   Quarantine and preventive measures to counter the new coronavirus infection Covid-19 have resulted in the proliferation of online conferences. Thus, the three planned meetings were held in an extended face-to-face format with partial online participation. Thanks to this, a significantly larger number of specialists were able to take part in meetings with presentations on the history of political and ethnic transformations in the territory of medieval Eastern Europe under the influence of the migration factor.
   The staff of the Center discussed a number of very significant issues of the history of the Great Hungarians, Volga Bulghars, and Tatars of the Golden Horde with colleagues from other research centers of the Russian Federation and foreign countries. As a result, the academic meeting led to ambiguous results on seemingly resolved problems.

DT Article
DE Ethnicity; Natural culture; Globalization; National identity; Memory;
   Ethnic conflicts
AB Many contemporary philosophers, and especially postmodern ones, emphasize that history is one of the representative practices by which the human subject is reproduced. It can probably be argued that the past is a definite model with which, in conditions of total uncertainty, historical perspectives can be outlined for the consolidation of society. It is the past that can become a "useful" resource with the help of which the ethnic group recreates its integrity and - accordingly - its present and future., the main subjective nature of ethnocentrism is emphasized by many researchers. Thus, according to anthropological interpretations, subjective vision ( how national problems, considered in their historical retrospective, are seen by the agents of the conflict) may be more important than the objectivity of historical science. In fact, distrust of historical meta-narratives is becoming an integral feature of modern social theories. This does not mean that arguing for subjectivism as an essential feature of ethnocentrism is the only position. It will be more correct to compare not nationalism and ethnocentrism, but nationalism and ethnicity, as a deep foundation of nationalism. So, in Western social science it is customary to connect nationalism with nation-building, identifying it with statehood, while ethnicity is considered as a source and way of constructing identity. At the same time, various approaches to assessing the correlation of ethnicity and nationalism have developed. So, there is an interpretation of nationalism as a kind of a political movement based on a false consciousness, which is created by ethnicity, but cannot be explained, because it has deeper roots that lie in political economy, and not in culture. Collective memory supports historical continuity through recollections of specific elements from the "archives of historical memory". This makes an analytical approach to the subjective discursive construction of ethnic identity possible, especially regarding the issue of what kind of "national history" is told, what and how is recalled, and between which "events" a connection is established, which is reflected in subjective representations.

DE "iustitia"; "aequitas"; medieval political thought; "Policraticus"; John
   of Salisbury
AB It might seem paradoxical, but there was no uniform understanding of justice as a term in medieval Europe, and especially in English political theory of the twelfth century (in John of Salisbury's "Policraticus"). The concepts "iustitia" and "aequitas" were used in the texts of the different genres written in Latin, and they are synonyms for some authors, but these are in opposition to one another and reflect the different poles of existence for others (for example, we encounter contrast the earthly justice ("iustitia") with celestial one ("aequitas" or "iustitia Del"), and with the perverted justice of devil ("iustitia diaboli") accepted by humankind and with the Divine justice in scholastic works). The term "justice" ("iustitia") meant the "art of right living" in the widest sense, the legality in Roman law tradition fed by a lot of important theories of the Antique philosophy and learned in West. The justice is in fact interpreted as orderliness and law and order, as a legal behaviour, regulated by the dispositions of the written laws. This understanding considered from the standpoint of the Holy Revelation was extended and added in Christian patristics: justice (the lexeme "justitia" is the most active as before) is associated with respect, with devotion with righteousness and even with the fear of God, and this means, it is converted into higher moral register.

AB The article outlines the special features of the UK foreign policy described as an outcome of the request for a new international role after the withdrawal from the EU. Proceeding from the theory of rational choice, the author concludes that the UK uses relations with Washington to adapt the idea of "Global Britain" to the changes in the international environment, taking into account the reduction of its own weight in international politics. It is highlighted that the synchronization of the UK and the US international agendas is taking place against the backdrop of deteriorated UK-EU relations. Atlanticism, along with disengagement from the EU, became the ideological basis of a new British foreign policy aimed at ensuring Western unity, while increasing its fragmentation. The significance of the new Atlantic Charter and the military-political alliance AUKUS for the foreign strategy of the UK is assessed. Despite the global nature of the articulated goals, the United Kingdom operates in the logic of a middle power in the face of intense international competition. It is concluded that the special emphasis on "hard" power and the strengthening of military-political alliances based on liberal values does not solve the strategic dilemmas of Britain, which will still have to balance between the major international actors.

ID FOUCAULT
AB The article analyzes the historical and theoretical aspects of interrelationship of sociology and other disciplines. The author examines the "positive" and "negative" sides of this interrelationship. The "positive" aspects can be seen in the explorations of the problems located on the borders of different disciplines, in the forms of inter-, multi- or trans-disciplinary studies, such as, for instance, the diffusion of innovations, gender or cultural studies. Even the thinkers, whose attitude towards sociology was sceptical or hostile, exercised a fruitful influence on the development of sociology. As examples can be cited the theory of close and open societies by Henri Bergson or the treatment of hermeneutics by Wilhelm Dilthey. The "negative" influence is illustrated by the postmodernism in sociological theory. Although, according to some analysts, it is dead in this field, its influence continues there; besides, it is reviving in new guises ("postpostmodernism", etc.). The author emphasizes such traits of postmodernism as the vagueness or senselessness of conceptual constructions; denial of interdisciplinary borders; devaluation of science and, at the same time, tendency to establish itself in it; pseudo newness and pretention to ultra -newness; verbiage, shocking, faddishness, political partisanship, etc. These statements are illustrated by the case of Michel Foucault, the most characteristic and famous postmodernist in sociology. One of the main conclusion of this article is the need of sociology to be more selective, critical and reflexive in its choice of external influences.

AB Optimizing the structure of the economy and ensuring the stable employment are the most important components in the policy of developing a flexible and competitive economy. The economic development strategies of the EAEU countries emphasize the need to increase the share of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in GDP and the share of the employed in this sector. However, the planned development parameters have never been achieved, which is determined not only by a long period of economic instability and insufficient government support for SMEs, but also by the social perception of entrepreneurship. The article considers the role of entrepreneurship, primarily small business, in the social-economic system. Based on the generalization of the entrepreneurship interpretations, the authors show that it has both economic and social significance, especially in the countries with developing markets Small business performs numerous functions and has such features as mass character, innovations, riskiness and responsibility; it is an institution of social development, and a factor of economic growth and political stability. The analysis of the activities of small business in the EAEU countries (Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia) in 2015-2019 shows their significant lag behind the developed countries. However, in recent years, the social role of SMEs has increased for they take into account the needs of local consumers and the possibilities of local markets, which is due both to the number of employees and their qualifications, and to the introduction of science-intensive technologies. The sociological data prove a change in the social perception of entrepreneurship: it is recognized as a successful career option and social status, but also as facing challenges that hinder its development. The article is based on the statistical data of the EAEU countries and the Eurasian Economic Commission, analytical materials of rating agencies and research centers.

AB The article focuses on cross-border cooperation of post-Soviet de facto states (Abkhazia, Donetsk, and Lugansk people's republics, Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, and South Ossetia) from the early 1990s until 2021. The author argues that in the most of examined cases cross-border cooperation of post-Soviet de facto states is not particularly effective. It can be largely explained by de facto states' complicated political relations with some adjacent recognized states, the illegitimacy of de facto borders for many potential partners, limited economic potentials of de facto states, perceiving them as a potential source of threats and instability even by friendly adjacent legitimate states, and over-centralized management of cross-border interactions by governments.
   Despite numerous problems. cross-border cooperation between post-Soviet de facto states and adjacent provinces of the relevant patron state (that is Russia) largely contributes to solving a de facto state's survival problems in the domains of health care, communication, and economic development. It should be noted that Russia's cooperation with those de facto states whose independence it has recognized is much more dynamic than cooperation with a non-recognized state. Cross-border cooperation between parent states and their "breakaway territories" is in its infancy in most cases. Relatively successful cooperation between Moldova and Transnistria can be considered as a partial exception but even in this case cooperation is periodically complicated with political contradictions. Finally, cross-border cooperation of a de facto state with a third country (Ukraine-Transnistria) is complicated with non-recognition and unfavorable political situation. while cooperation between two de facto states (between Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics) by hypercentralized governance in both republics.

AB The article examines the strategic war narrative as a tool used by the state after 1989 to justify the start of a war or justify its end. Based on the understanding of this term, introduced into the popular science turnover by M. Vlahos, the author of the article expands the conceptual framework by referring to the narrative principle of collective memory by J. Verch. It is concluded that the war narrative is partly similar to the concept of mnemonic security (as well as other hegemonic forms of memory), which is tested on the A. Peto's concept. A review of key domestic and foreign research works on the topic is carried out. The key elements of the war narrative (symbols, sacrifice, etc.) within political dimension are identified, as well as the victory narrative, which was in demand in the first months of V. V. Putin (coinciding with the outbreak of hostilities in Chechnya in the period since 1999 and the continuation until 2009 in the form of counter-terrorism measures on the territory of the republic and the border regions of the North Caucasus).

SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Wasta; social capital; group loyalty; Arab world; modernization
ID GUANXI; NETWORKS; JEITINHO
AB The article examines the relationship between the traditional group relations (intrafamily, clan, etc.) in the Arab society, which provide access to the political rent, and the processes of socio-political modernization and the building of civil institutions. The Arab governments usually explain the inefficiency or "deviations" in the work of such institutions by national characteristics, adherence to the idea of nation-building, etc., but never by the desire to preserve power and assets of the traditional elites that are based on group loyalty. One of the most common ways of accessing power in order to acquire and redistribute tangible and intangible benefits in the Arab world is Wasta, or a system of connections, based on group loyalty and client-patronage relationships. Loyalty to one's group that almost everyone belongs to by birth or due to certain life circumstances ensures the interests of the individual in the broadest sense. Wasta's network and group ties, based on the principles that are at odds with those that the civil society is built upon, impede the development and modernization of social and political institutions.
   While researchers have studied Wasta relations as such rather structurally, both at the micro-level (from the social network point of view) and at the macro-level (from the institutional point of view), the attempts to build a holistic model that considers Wasta simultaneously from both viewpoints have not yet been crowned with success. The article proposes the conceptualization of Wasta as social capital, which makes it possible to represent this type of relationship as one actor's "investment" and the other actor's "loan". One can also use this holistic model in the analysis of other informal ties inherent in other cultures but also based on group loyalty and client-patronage relationships and provide fertile soil for maintaining conservative order.

TI TRANSITION FROM AUSTRIAN TO AMERICAN MODEL OF JUDICIAL REVIEW IN THE
   EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE
SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY
   OF POLITICS
LA Russian
DT Review
DE judicial review; models of judicial review; European Court of Justice;
   legal order; reform of the constitutional court
AB Legal scholars distinguish between two main models of judicial review - the American model and Austrian (European) one. In the American model, the scope of discretion and the relative role of the constitutional court in the political system are noticeably higher than in the Austrian one. The author traces the history of the origin of these two models, explains the differences between them and raises the question of whether the boundaries between these two ideal types are too rigid or whether a gradual transition from the Austrian model to the American one (without formal constitutional reform) is possible. The author provides the answer drawing on the real case of such transition that occurred in the European Court of Justice in the 1960s. This case is unique precisely because the change in the system of the judicial review was the result of the gradual "migration" from one model to the other, rather than the result of an outside reform. Similar to Baron Munchausen, who pulled himself out of the swamp by his own hair, the European Court of Justice was able to independently, through its own decisions, alter the order of the judicial review in the European Union, bringing it closer to the American model.
   In the final part of the article, the author places this transition into a broader historical context, demonstrating that the success of the construction of a new European legal order was not predetermined and consisted of the decisions taken by the judges in each specific case. However, any national constitutional court finds itself in a similar situation after a change of the political regime. As a rule of thumb, new constitutional courts are created according to the Austrian model and are institutionally similar to the legislative branch of government, but in order to make judicial review efficient, they need to transform into the American model, becoming more similar to the courts of general jurisdiction. In this respect, the experience of the European Court of Justice can be extremely useful for them.

Particular emphasis is placed on publications with more than 100 authors, since such publications indicate the organization's involvement in global scientific networks and are more noticeable to the world scientific and educational community. The analysis is carried out using InCites of the Web of Science Core Collection. All types of publications for the period 2012-2019 are analyzed. The article provides an overview of the literature on the development of international scientific cooperation and the current state of international scientific collaborations. The study reveals an expansion of Russian scientific and educational organizations that have publications in the above-mentioned database, and a gradual increase in their publication productivity. At the same time, the publication productivity of organizations that have publications with more than 100 authors is gradually decreasing due to the increase in the number of such Russian organizations, but it still remains higher than in some countries leading in publication activity. It is shown that publications with more than 100 authors in almost all broad scientific fields receive more citations, particularly in physics, where large scientific teams are common practice. The analysis also shows that, in Russia, besides physics, international cooperation within large scientific teams is also widespread in other scientific disciplines, and publications made in such cooperation are one of the drivers of Russian universities and Russian science in the world scientific and educational environment.

DE Kalmykia; Astrakhan region; Dagestan; interethnic relations; repressed
   people; forced resettlement; territorial issue; territorial
   rehabilitation; desert; ecological history
AB Based on the documents of the National archives of the Republic of Kalmykia, the article examines the territorial issues between the Republic and the Astrakhan region, which could have been resolved according to the RSFSR's law "on the rehabilitation of repressed peoples" (territorial rehabilitation), adopted in April 1991. Apart from the issue of territorial rehabilitation, Kalmykia had a dispute with the Astrakhan region in relation to the land situated within the Republic's administrative boundaries, but used by enterprises of the Astrakhan region.
   The adoption of the RSFSR law "on the rehabilitation of repressed peoples" served as a catalyst not only for further political rehabilitation of these peoples, but also triggered territorial claims of certain subjects to one another. In Kalmykia, this situation was also aggravated due to the unresolved land dispute with the Astrakhan region over the pastures in the Black land zone existing since 1957. Both sides appealed to the Federal government (both of the USSR and the RSFSR). With the beginning of perestroika and democratization of Kalmykia's social system, it justified its arguments referring to all-Union and Russian Federation acts on the rehabilitation of repressed peoples, as well as constitutional provisions on the Republic' territorial integrity. The Astrakhan region, in its turn, cautiously and negatively reacted toward the provisions on the territorial rehabilitation of repressed peoples, citing the changed ethnic composition of the population in the disputed areas and some other historical circumstances. The author concludes that the Kalmyk authorities hoped for a gradual resolution of the disputed issues by the central authorities in a constitutional way. However, with the collapse of the USSR and the political struggle going on between the all-Union and Russian Federation authorities, territorial issues between the regions were not a priority for them and were not on the immediate agenda.

The objective factors should be classified as geographical, historical, cultural and religious, the key subjective factors can be considered the role of a leader. This factor is standard for Middle Eastern states, especially for Egypt, where there are traditions of strong centralized powers. Egyptian leaders have supreme power in foreign policy decisions within the framework of the political system. Egypt's foreign policy is often determined by the personal character traits of the country's leaders.
   This article aims to study the role of the head of the Egypt in the search for foreign policy identity in the context of an identity crisis at the national level. Egypt has a long history of authoritarian rule, because it is impossible to separate national identity from foreign policy identity. Since its independent existence, each period with its own context established a different framework of identity and worldview for decision-makers in the field of Egypt`s foreign policy. The predominance of various elements in ideological as well as worldview in the age of the rule of a particular president has led to noticeable differences in Egypt's foreign policy at the current stage.
   This article attempts to answer the following research questions: What place does of the institute of the heads of State in foreign policy decisions? How leader's influence does determine the foreign policy role of the state? What changes in foreign policy priorities have taken place during the analysis period? What are the reasons for the differences between the main periods of Egypt's foreign policy in goals, tools and approaches to the outside world? The author comes to the conclusion that the change of the political leader plays an important role in the transformations of Egypt's foreign policy. The article analyzes the main trends in the foreign policy self-perception of Egypt in order to confirm the hypothesis that the foreign policy identity of Egypt had not evolved a discontinuity even in the conditions of dramatic events, whether it is the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Peace treaty with Israel or the events of the Arab Spring.

AB The development of a methodology for text analysis on information and communication platforms and social networks is becoming an urgent need not only for modern social and human sciences, but also for the practical field of empirical research. Discourse analysis, as opposed to content analysis, involves not only frequency calculation of words in their context, but also contextual analysis of speech acts as a whole, taking into account their structural features. At present, there is no uniform methodology for discourse analysis. Different schools choose a different object of analysis when using this method. The School of Continental Europe focuses on the analysis of written texts, the Anglo-Saxon School on the analysis of oral speech and discourse. The first attempt to conduct a discourse analysis of written speech in social networks was made by the Russian researcher Yu.G. Misnikov. I continue to develop the methodology of discourse analysis in its application to the digital sphere. The aim of this article is to develop a new approach to discourse analysis of small texts and deliberations in the form of judgments placed on digital platforms of communication with regional authorities, as well as in social networks related to these platforms. The methods of structural and functional analysis, discourse analysis, and general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis have been used in writing this article. The working hypothesis of my project is the statement that, on modern Russian platforms of communication with the authorities, the information type of judgments based on the interaction of the "stimulus-reaction" kind prevails. The development of the toolkit implies reference to the existing methods of conducting discourse analysis, selection of a conceptual framework for substantive justification of the new methodology of discourse analysis, preparation of the toolkit based on it and its subsequent testing on the basis of judgments posted on the digital platform of communication with regional authorities. The conceptual framework for the discourse analysis toolkit became the concept of lay epistemics by American social psychologist A. Kruglanski and the parameters his research team and he used in the parametric model of social judgment.

   period; literary criticism; receptions; Soviet-American literary

AB The Soviet literary pantheon of foreign writers widely read and popular in the USSR was made up as a result of conscious focused efforts and purposeful work of Soviet literary institutions. The case study of Theodore Dreiser (who was criticized as a "petty-bourgeois individualist" in the 1920s but gained a reputation of the greatest twentieth-century American classic and the best friend of the Soviet Union by the early 1930s) allows the researchers to uncover and analyze the mechanism of emergence of such a phenomenon as "a Soviet foreign classic". The study carried out in the spirit of historico-literary and source-based approach involves in-depth exploration of Dreiser's Soviet translations and publishing strategy that culminated in the twelve-volume collected works published in 1950-1955, as well as detailed examination of literary criticism in periodicals and books that reflected Dreiser's growing reputation - obviously a response to the changing political agenda and ideological shifts. The paper is based on published materials and unpublished documents from the Russian archives, including Dreiser's correspondence with Soviet literary institutions, periodicals, editors, critics; the authors also use feedback from readers organized and gathered by Goslitizdat - reviews and comments made by "ordinary people" on Dreiser's views and beliefs, his novels, plots, characters and style. Special attention is paid to the principles of selection of Dreiser's works by editors and publishers who presented Dreiser to the Soviet readers in the "correct" perspective. The authors look at the phenomenon of Dreiser's Soviet texts - publications in Soviet press unknown to American audience and adaptations of Dreiser's works for stage and filming, made by Soviet dramatists and their role in the formation of the Soviet canon of Dreiser. Diving into this material helps to reconstruct the methods applied by agents of the Soviet "literary field" to create and convey a specific Soviet image of Dreiser, quite different from his image and reputation at home.

ID DISPUTES
AB The review is devoted to scientific and historical-journalistic works of the late Soviet and post-Soviet periods which formulate the original versions of the events of the Interregnum of 1825 and the revolt of the Decembrists. The elimination of the ideological framework of Soviet studies of the Decembrists emancipated scholarly research and made it possible to put forward previously impossible concepts and hypotheses. On the other hand, the same circumstance contributed to the emergence of conspiracy theories and other quasi-scientific or not at all scientific versions that are not based on the necessary sources, but appeal to a wide range of readers. As a result, modern literature has developed a contradictory variety of conceptual models of different levels and quality claiming to explain the events of 1825. This review offers an experience of understanding the existing range of concepts, versions and hypotheses in post-soviet historiography. It focuses on the main discussion topics: about the circle of contenders to the throne (whether it was limited to Grand Dukes or included the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna); about the position and role of the Governor-General of the capital Miloradovich and the existence of a general opposition or a conspiracy of generals who supported the transfer of the throne to Grand Duke Constantine; about the role of the secret society of the Decembrists and the officer conspiracy initiated by him in the Guards Corps; about other influential political actors (the Russian-American Company, the "German party", etc.) presumably opposing the accession of Grand Duke Nicholas.

DE National Security Strategy; national interests; spiritual and moral
   development; nationalization of the elites
AB In May 2016, analyzing the interim results of the third presidential term of V.V. Putin, as well as the National Security Strategy, signed by the head of state on December 31, 2015, we have concluded that "the contradictions existing today in the public administration system are a natural result of the President's activities" related to the unresolved task of "bringing the interests of the elites in line with the national security interests" (Source: Ilyin V.A. President Vladimir Putin's third four-year term: contradictory outcomes - an expected result. Economic and social changes: facts, trends, forecast, 2016, no. 2 (44). pp. 9-21). Five years later, in the middle of 2021, a number of internal and external political events (including the new National Security Strategy signed by the President of the Russian Federation on July 2, 2021) again actualizes the question of the need to analyze the key changes that have occurred in the country during this period. How have the Russian society and the public administration system changed? What conceptual problems are still unresolved? And the most important: what role can the current trends in the development of the state and society play in the context of ensuring Russia's national security, taking into account the current situation in the domestic and foreign political arena by the middle of 2021? The following material reflects the authors' point of view on these issues. Based on expert assessments, data of official statistics, and Russian and regional sociological studies, the article analyzes the essence and prospects for the implementation of specific provisions of the National Security Strategy 2021. The authors come to the conclusion that the Strategy objectively reflects the current position of Russia in the domestic and foreign political arena by the middle of 2021, while its key points are aimed at a longterm perspective and are focused primarily on strengthening moral component of the Russian elites and Russian society. This causes positive feelings, but at the same time, based on the analysis of the previous experience in achieving strategic goals and objectives set out in the "May decrees" and national projects, it leaves conflicting expectations about the realism of their practical implementation.

The creative biography of Kokiev took shape in the 1920s - 1940s with the dominance of the school of M. N. Pokrovsky, which significantly influenced his scientific outlook. The scientist identified political and civic loyalty to the state with the right to freedom of thought, independence of scientific research, rejecting suspicions of disloyalty.

AB Knowledge of the directions of reformating the modern unstable world order allows Russia to determine its role which it can play in this process and its new format. Therefore, the purpose of our research is to identify the main trends in the development of political, ideological, civilizational, geopolitical processes that affect the formation of a new configuration of the world in connection with the transformations dictated by the change of the technological order. For such a study, the method of complex analysis of these processes and the method of comparisons were used in relation to a new model of human existence, which is formed under the influence of the transition to a new technological order. As a result, the author comes to the conclusion that all these processes, both individually and in combination, inevitably lead to the revival of the model of the bipolar world, but in its modified form. However, what is happening with the change of the technological way of life pushes these problems into the background, while the dilemma - to be or not to be for humanity as a species - comes to the forefront with threatening force. It is between these "to be" or "not to be" the main watershed will take place between East and West in their confrontation passes.

AB The article examines the content and structure of geoconfessiology, which, according to the authors, is a scientific discipline in the modern geopolitical science. In a meaningful sense, geoconfessiology provides research and understanding of the origin and spread of religions in the world; the struggle of religions to influence public policy, to become the dominant religion in the largest number of countries and in the world as a whole. The object of geoconfessiology in a broad sense is all the space of the sacred. Its object in a narrow sense is the formation of religious space, that is, the origin and spread of religions. The focus of geoconfessiology in a broad sense is relations between religion and states and societies. The focus of geoconfessiology in a narrow sense is the study of the origin and spread of religions, the relations between religions and states, the struggle of religions for influence and dominance. The authors determine the place of geoconfessiology as one of the structural elements of geopolitics based on the structure of geopolitics, which in addition to geoconfessiology includes geohistory, geo-economics, geo-ethnopolitics, geoconflictology and geofuturology. The structure of geoconfessiology includes scientific-problem and scientific-disciplinary parts. The scientific-problem part of geoconfessiology consists of the following problems it seeks to solve: the balance of power in the global religious-political arena and the structure of this global religious-political system; the changing balance of forces leading religions and churches, and the transformation of the global religious-political arena; the struggle between national religions for dominance in the public consciousness of believers in each country and globally; the influence of the national church and religion in general on the policies of national states; the struggle between national churches for influence on a global scale; the struggle between national and world religions for dominance in the world powers that determine the world order. The scientific-disciplinary structure of geoconfessiology consists of geographical, sociological, psychological, and political science parts, the content of which is also studied in the article. The geographical part of geoconfessiology studies the geography of the origin of world, regional and national religions, geographical (including climatic, landscape, and soil) conditions and factors for the spread of religious teachings. The other parts of geoconfessiology - sociological, psychological, and political science - are examined in the second part of the article.

AB The article discusses the problem of the perception of mentoring by representatives of scientific dynasties. Attention is drawn to the fact that the topic of studying professional dynasties has numerous research perspectives. The relevance of the author's attention to the topic is due to the fact that mentoring is one of the factors of professional reproduction. It acquires special significance precisely in the scientific field. The study is based on the analysis of narratives of interviews taken from representatives of natural sciences, humanities, medical sciences, who consider themselves representatives of dynasties. At the same time, a subjective perspective of the study was chosen, within the framework of which the subject's reflection on mentoring and teachers is of particular interest. The interpretative approach allows for ambiguous interpretations in the construction of theoretical models of mentoring. The author has identified several models of the perception of mentoring: "parent", "family", "teacher"; this allows speaking about its differentiated nature. Sex and age conditions have not been found. About half of the respondents mentioned their parents in the role of a mentor, but a small number assigned them the role of the "main mentor". The leading factors here were, presumably, the type of the child's personality, allowing some pressure, and the parents' social capital. The fact that the answers often confused the concepts of mentoring and influence as such makes the boundary between Model 2 and Model 3 rather unstable. It is concluded that teachers, mentors, or colleagues in the role of the "significant other" are real actors of secondary socialization since the majority of respondents mentioned them. Attention is drawn to negative responses about mentors. Determined by individual life experience, such responses direct the conversation about mentoring from an objectivist perspective into the mental space of reflection on their professional development, dynastic affiliation, and the value of family ties. Thus, the study allows speaking about the typological features of the reproduction mechanism in professional dynasties, the variability of direct and indirect influence. On the other hand, it is clear that both sides are involved in the design of the models. In other words, the intersubjectivity of mentoring imparts an active character to the perception and, most importantly, comprehension of mentoring (the image of the teacher) as a factor of professional socialization.

Such phaleronyms (medals, crosses, etc.) can be intended for the following groups of people: prisoners of war, political prisoners, deported and internees, and those who have suffered from the actions of terrorists. These awards are usually confined to specific historical events (as a rule, to the First and Second World Wars), however, the late 20th - early 21st centuries witnessed the emergence of several universal badges.

   state capacity; comparative analysis; validity; correlation analysis;

AB The article analyzes the heuristic potential of leading cross-country indices and ratings for comparative and institutional analysis of the Russian Federation and other countries of the world. The author proves that numerous comparative cross-country ratings and indices that have become extremely popular in social sciences in recent decades have transgressed the research framework and could influence the economy of various countries, their educational and scientific systems, external image, political agendas and legitimacy of political regimes.
   The author carries out a correlation analysis of positions of 145 countries in 16 comparative rating studies highly cited in social and political science and calculates the coefficient of their correlation with the positions of the Russian Federation. Additionally, the author compares the scores of 144 countries in the array of 16 ratings with the relevant indicators of the Russian Federation, which allowed to distinguish a group of countries showing maximum institutional identity with Russia, according to the compilers of the ratings. The author states that discovered correlations lack empirical evidence and convincing interpretation. At the same time, they are largely affected by political and ideological factors, as well as the effect of "image evaluation". The author concludes that the analyzed cross-country indices have considerable heuristic potential, but the patterns and correlations based solely on statistical analysis of their data, and, particularly, qualitative assessments, do not fully meet the criteria of obtaining new scientific knowledge and should be considered mainly as hypotheses that require additional causal substantiation and empirical verification. The article shows that mandatory hierarchy of representation inherent in the cross-country ratings creates the basis for their politicization and contradicts the contemporary reality that strives towards polymodality of the world order.

LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB This chapter analyses data from research carried out among young Indigenous people in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) to elicit what they perceive to be qualities of a good political leader. We investigate theoretical aspects of the formation of political youth culture and factors influencing the representation of political leadership. Empirical research results from two surveys, supported by qualitative fieldwork, in an urban and a rural setting, reveal young people's perceptions of what makes an ideal leader. We analyse similarities between urban and rural youth in their ideas about political leadership. Urban students emphasised the importance of the personal qualities of a good political leader, while rural Indigenous youth found professional qualities important. Using categories of political leadership identified by Hermann, we found that the preferred political leader for students studying in the regional capital fits the leadership type of `leader-servant', whereas the rural young people prioritised what is called a 'leader-fireman'. All together, we find that ideas of political leadership among Indigenous youth follow the Russian mainstream political culture. We argue that this is because politics in the RSY is made within the Russian political system (albeit by local Indigenous politicians) and not by Indigenous politicians according to Indigenous traditional institutions of leadership.

DT Article
DE Arctic; spatial economy; Spatial Development Strategy of the Russian
   Federation; Northern Sea Route; cargo turnover
AB The new plans for Russian Arctic development are predetermined by changes in the external economic environment and the state's internal policy. In May 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced new development guidelines for the Northern Sea Route. Later on, the documents related to the strategic development of the Russian Arctic zone were approved. In these documents, the Northern Sea Route development is highlighted as one of the main directions of competitive national transport communication of the Russian Federation on the global market. The purpose of the research is to determine the role of the Northern Sea Route in the country's spatial and socio-economic development in the context of the Spatial Development Strategy of the Russian Federation until 2025. The long-term plans launched various economic, political, and other socially significant processes in the Russian Arctic, which led to the formulation of two research tasks. The first one is to consider the main approaches to the spatial management of the regional economy and to present the implementation of the spatial economy provisions in case of the Northern Sea Route that is the center of the Arctic space "assembly". The second one is to reveal the Northern Sea Route potential as a transport and logistics highway in the transit traffic area, transportation of raw materials, and ensuring vital activity of the population of the Northern regions in deliveries of goods to the Northern territories. As a result of the research, the authors have identified the main trends in the NSR development: strengthening of Russia's domestic economic policy, aimed at activating business processes in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation, and the usage of the NSR as an international transit highway. Data analysis on transportation of raw materials and goods deliveries to the Northern territories indicates that inland navigation will soon be a dominant type of navigation on the Northern Sea Route.

TI Sacralization of Peace by the Choice of Dates for Conclusion of
   International Treaties within Westphalian System
SO MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Westphalian system; international congress; representation of Peace;
   sacred symbolism of dates; Christian holiday
AB The issues of peace have always been important for historical science. However, in recent years, international historiography began to pay attention to Peace congresses' symbolism and socio-cultural design. The symbolic power of "special days" - whether it is a Christian holiday or an event of exceptional significance - allowed people of early Modernity to express their attitude to reality and power. An analysis of the choice of the dates for the conclusion of Peace by adversary states within the Westphalian system demonstrates three persistent variants of the dates. The first is signing a peace treaty on Saturday, Sunday, or a Christian holiday. The most striking example of this option is the signing of the Peace of Westphalia itself (treaties in Munster and Osnabruck on October 24, 1648), on Saturday - the day before the second Sunday after Trinity. The second option involves a reference to an important event in the past. For example, the Peace in Passarovitz between the Holy Roman Empire and Porta (1718) and the Russian-Turkish Peace in Kuchuk-Kaynardzhi (1774) were signed on the same date - July 21, the date when Istanbul and Peter the Great signed the Prut Peace Treaty in 1711. Since the age of the Enlightenment, when the "Right of Peace" began to compete with the "Right of War" in political theories, the date of Peace could be directly determined by the end of negotiations. Sometimes the conclusion of the Peace became a Christian holiday. Peter the Great decided to consecrate the day of the conclusion of the Nystad Peace Treaty by transferring the relics of the Holy Grand Duke Alexander Nevsky from Vladimir to the new Russian capital - St. Petersburg. Conclusion of the Peace was used as a tool of social constructivism, implemented through modeling. The political idea was symbolically grounded in significant historical or religious dates. Combining the historical precedent, the Christian holiday and the end of the war emphasized the sacred nature of Peace as the highest social value.

AB Introduction. Currently, interest in studying the creative heritage of prominent Russian historians has increased significantly, the formation of conceptual views of which took place under the conditions of the dominance of the Marxist-Leninist methodology. Such researchers include Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation, Doctor of Historical Sciences, Professor Grigory Alekseevich Gerasimenko. His scientific heritage is widely and highly appreciated by specialists. Methods and materials. The fate and scientific work of the scientist was recreated on the basis of the works published by him, reviews of them, attraction of memoirs, bibliographic reference books and some documentary materials on the basis of which his works were created. In this article, on the basis of the anthropological method, the problems of scientific research by G.A. Gerasimenko at different periods of his life and work are analyzed; the principles and methods of research practices of the scientist are considered. Analysis. The first stage of scientific and pedagogical activity of the scientist is connected with the Saratov State University named after N.G. Chernyshevsky, where he studied, then taught at the Faculty of History and created his scientific works. They present observations and conclusions about the party- political struggle in the councils of workers' and soldiers' deputies of the Volga region; on the basis of mass historical sources, the forms and methods of organizing peasant committees in 1917 were shown, the dynamics of their social composition were revealed. These definitions conditioned the historian's contribution to the study of the topical issues of the Great Russian Revolution. The article shows the expansion of the chronological and territorial framework of research by G.A. Gerasimenko during the Moscow period of his scientific activity. He turned to identifying the prerequisites for radical actions of peasants, revealed the causes of conflicts between the people and the authorities, and outlined the positions of public organizations during the revolution. Results. Analyzing the work of the historian, the authors revealed traditions and innovations in his work, noted new methodological techniques and historiographic plots in the scientist's creative laboratory.

AB Introduction. The study is devoted to the results of the implementation of regional projects by the federal entities of the Southern Federal District in 2019 within the reference points of competitiveness, sustainability, security, balance. Its peculiarity consists in the analysis of the interrelations between the achieved state of competitiveness, sustainability, security, balance, the level of socio-economic development in a particular region, the quality of the implementation of regional projects in the context of the specifics of the regional management system, the existing relations between authorities, economic entities, civil society institutions. At the same time, along with the quality of life, it is important to achieve political stability and security. Methodology and methods. The research methodology is based on the systemic paradigm of the relationship between the instruments of state regulation of regional development and the results of regional development within the reference points of competitiveness, sustainability, security, balance of regions, for which a database on the regional implementation of national projects was formed. In order to obtain quantitative characteristics, an integral scoring method of ranking with a correlation and regression analysis was applied. Analysis. The research showed that the higher the indicators of competitiveness, sustainability, security, balance, the better the quality of regional projects' implementation. In turn, the reference points: competitiveness, sustainability, security, balance are higher in the regions with high values of gross regional product in general and per capita, as well as these federal entities have higher values of the achieved standard of living. Results. The correlation between efficiency level of territorial economic systems, assessed on the basis of indicators of competitiveness, sustainability, security, balance and the quality of the results of national projects' implementation was studied, which made it possible to determine that the higher the level of regional development, the better national projects are realized. The idea is justified that the existing form of regional projects' implementation becomes a factor not smoothing, but strengthening the territorial differentiation, since regions with a better level of development and large gross regional product values due to regional projects receive an additional stimulus for further changes. The conclusion about the limited character of the approach that connects the issues of territories mainly with the lack of financial resources is made. Significant role of the institutional factor of regional development, especially risk-oriented management, in the implementation of national projects is shown.

AB The article is devoted to the regional peculiarities of ethnic policy having been analyzed on the example of Transbaikal region of Russian Empire. During the period under investigation it was a kind of national outlying district which lagged behind other Siberian territories in social-economic and cultural development. At the same time it was closely connected with foreign policy ambitions of the Empire which considered it as starting point for strengthening economic and political influence in Inner Asia. Geopolitical potential of the region and its unpreparedness to play the intended role defined ethnic policy mode. Frontier position of the region demanded the necessity of administrative system unification in order to provide unity of its indigenous population (Buryats) with Russian people. Nevertheless, insufficient flexibility in this issue caused protest movement growth and was the reason of region vulnerability against foreign threat. Transbaikalia economic reinforcing acceleration at last defined comparatively mild variant of relations arrangement with none-indigenous ethnic groups in spite of the exiled status and established opinion of their unreliability. Regional administration regarded them as promising colonization element, having high educational potential, as well as business experience in frames of free competition, local population having no such. This policy allowed former exiles to fit regional society organically and display their abilities to the full extent.
   The results obtained may be used while researching regions' independence degree in decision making in ethnic issue and possibility of official course correction due to the status of the region and thus peculiarities of its development.

DE lobbying; interest groups; politics in Italy; regulation of lobbying
AB The current article analyses the mechanism of interaction between interest groups and public decision makers in Italy. The author seeks to explore the main trends in the development of the interest groups system, its institutional environment, vectors of interaction with political parties and the executive branch. The author shows that lobbying in Italy is an integral part of the political process, but it has a number of features that distinguish the Italian model from that of other countries of Western Europe and North America. It can be explained by the specifics of the Italian political system, political culture, unstable party system, and constantly changing lobbying mechanism. Inter-elite, patronage ties dominate in the interaction between interest groups and the government. Equal access to decision makers is one of the key problems of the Italian lobbying mechanism. Lack of transparency and informal communication channels continue to be an unresolved problem that does not allow the political system to efficiently process the plurality of existing group interests. Despite numerous discussions and bills, Italy has not yet moved on to creating a unified regulatory regime that would clearly define the rules of interaction between interest groups and decision makers. Although separate norms have been implemented in six Italian regions, the parliament and two ministries, they are not harmonized with each other. In particular, business groups (most influential lobbyists) do not fall under regional regulation, while many rules at the national level, which should in theory facilitate the access to decision makers, are offset by the lack of transparency in the real life lobbying. The solution to the problem of unequal access lies not only within a unified set of norms and rules aimed at regulating lobbying ( although this should be a necessary first step), but in a general increase of transparency in the decision-making process, creation of clearer codes of conduct for politicians, regulation of "revolving doors", and reduction of conflicts of interest.

DE lobbying; interest groups; post-socialist political systems;

   lobbying
AB In order to promote industrialization and improve the living standards of the population in the Sub-Current article is dedicated to lobbying development in post-socialist EU member states from Central and Eastern Europe. This is an important and at the same time insufficiently studied aspect of political systems in CEE. Models of lobbying in Slovenia and Poland that are analyzed in the article, demonstrate that there is no single vector of lobbying development in post-socialist countries. It is shown that interaction between interest groups and decision makers is influenced by following factors: dynamics and state of interest group systems, mechanism of interaction between interest groups and decision makers, Europeanization of politics, and particularities of lobbying regulation. Author comes to several conclusions: 1) Both countries have inherited tradition of informal political relations, but there is difference between corporatist model in Slovenia that resulted in more stable interest group system and Polish neoliberal model that gave birth to more conflict driven interest group system; 2) Europeanization of politics had different impact on the state of lobbying on national level, fostering its development in Slovenian case and having little impact in Poland; 3) Although majority of lobbying is happening in the executive branch, parties are the main mediators between interest groups and decision making; 4) Neither of analyzed countries are ideal in terms of lobbying regulation. However, Slovenia did progress further in comparison with Poland, using more transparent registration and reporting for lobbyists and officials and also regulating indirect forms of lobbying; at the same time most of lobbying takes places in shadows while regulation aimed only at professional consultants is not efficient enough.

TI DEVIATIONS OF THE POLITICS OF MEMORY IN EASTERN EUROPE AND IN THE
   POST-SOVIET SPACE
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE World War II; Eastern Europe; post-Soviet space; politics of memory;
   confrontation
AB The narratives of the Second World War, which may undoubtedly be referred to as "complex issues of history", have not been entirely reflected upon yet and therefore are full of phobias and myths. While analysing the set of tools of the politics of memory, the author of this article points outs the following: the politicisation of history (following political conjuncture), the manipulation of facts, the glorifica-tion of history and its actors, demonisation, i. e., the construction of the image of an internal and external enemy, the ideological censoring of controversial assessments, and the actualisation of sociopolitical nostalgia. The use of this arsenal of ideological influence on mass consciousness can be seen in high-profile sociopolitical incidents of recent times. The difference in historical assessments is a reality that is pointless to obscure. Overcoming historical traumas, i. e., the "combination of history and memory", is an indispensable condition for normalising and objectifying reflection on the past. The subject of the author's attention is foreign policy invectives that have become hotbeds of diplomatic tension (more particularly, the Declaration of the European Parliament on the Outbreak of World War II adopted in 2019), the activities of governmental organisations "responsible" for the politics of memory (the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory), expositions of museums in Eastern Europe (the Museum of the Second World War in Gdansk, the Museum of the Occupation in Riga), school history textbooks, the fate of the monuments dedicated to the Second World War (in particular, the Bronze Soldier in Tallinn), public historical and political actions that "overturn" historical reality (for example, Legionnaire Day marches in Riga), and the censorship of publications with an alternative view of the traumatic events of the war.

TI THE ORIGINS OF RUSSIAN POLITICAL MODERNITY: DID RADISHCHEV "CRIB" HIS

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Alexander Radishchev; Immanuel Kant; Enlightenment; classical
   republicanism; public use of reason; public sphere; hommes de lettres;
   political theory; literary theory; political modernity
AB The paper argues that Alexander Radishchev's well-known work A Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow (1790), which is a seminal text for the Russian Enlightenment, contains an unattributed passage borrowed from Immanuel Kant's essay "What Is Enlightenment" (1784). That passage is by no means extraneous; it is crucial for understanding the logic of Radishchev's republican Enlightenment project, which was an important origin of political modernity in Russia. In keeping with Kant, Radishchev views the Enlightenment as a singular historical stage in the evolution of European societies and as the core component of emancipation for the modern era, which represents the transition of European societies from a state of subjugation to despotic powers (the "state of slavery") to a state of autonomy or self-governance (the "state of freedom"). Although at the time Journey was written Kant's article was not widely known in Russia, Radishchev was clearly familiar with it. In addition to the passage directly transcribed from Kant's article, Radishchev's text addresses all the basic political and philosophical issues that Kant linked to the concept of "the public use of reason," although Radishchev tailored them to the socio-political situation in late eighteenth-century Russia.
   However, if Radishchev really borrowed the formulation of the Enlightenment project directly from Kant - or at least did so partially-why wouldn't he cite his source? Moreover, why did he mislead his readers, along with generations of literary historians, by using confusing references? The paper argues that addressing these questions through the lens of contemporary political theory would allow a better understanding of the distinctive features of the Enlightenment in Russia and literary practices during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

DE Bunakov-Fondaminsky; Russia; philosophy; history; civilizational

AB The article examines the question of the evolution of the philosophical and historical views of the Russian intellectual and politician Ilya Isidorovich Fondaminsky (1880-1942; literary and political pseudonym "Bunakov"). A native of a Jewish merchant family who studied philosophy in Berlin and Heidelberg and an active socialist-revolutionary, I.I. Bunakov-Fondaminsky became one of the key figures of the Russian emigration. During the German occupation of France, he received Orthodox baptism and ended his life in a Nazi concentration camp (in 2004, he was canonized by the Patriarchate of Constantinople). The author focuses on the historiosophical concept of "Ways of Russia", set forth by I.I. Bunakov-Fondaminsky in the articles of the 1920s and 1940s in the Parisian emigrant magazines "Modern Notes" and "Novy Grad". According to Bunakov-Fondaminsky, historical Russia is "The East in the North", and its fate is the history of the "eastern theocracy in the north of Eurasia", for several centuries "irradiated" by the western waves.

DE social Darwinism; social ethics; inequality; Christianity
AB The article aims to revise the stereotyped interpretation of the ideological background of the crime around which the plot of Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment (1865) unfolds and to give a deeper and more accurate reading of it. According to this reading, the direct motive for the murder of the old usurer and her sister was not Raskolnikov's theory, which he set forth in his article "On Crime" and later, during the first conversation with the investigator, but the 'progressive' beliefs widespread at that time. In the novel, the main mouthpiece of these beliefs is Luzhin. His theory was the first to be stated in the novel, and it is with it that Raskolnikov first connects his atrocity. In what relation to each other are the two theories? What kind of causality connects each with the murder? To answer these questions, the author sequentially examines the theories and then reveals the dialectical connection between them, traced in the novel and other works by Dostoevsky. At the end, a recipe for a panacea is discussed, which the writer prescribed to his modern (and our?) society, captivated by false mindsets and beliefs. It is shown that the quintessence of Luzhin's doctrine consisted in justifying selfishness, unlimited competition, and atomization of society, called to abandon traditional Christian ethics in the name of those 'advanced' ideals. As for Raskolnikov's theory, since he modifies it in the course of events, two main versions of it should be distinguished: canonical and modified ones. Unlike Luzhin, Raskolnikov does not find his theory (its canonical version) anti-Christian. In his opinion, it does not discriminate against anyone, and the permanent confrontation between the 'igher' and 'lower' human types comes from their mutual danger for each other. It is proved that this theory has a predominantly historiosophical character, not devoid of romanticism, and that in general it was the theory of Dostoevsky himself. Thus, the real motives for the murder are not directly related to this theory. Rather, they are added to the theory in a parasitic way and set a mode of using it for people cannot deliberately apply the socio-historical 'laws' elucidated in the canonical version since these laws belong to the mysterious-providential realm. No ideology can be built on their foundation without their radical perversion and forgery. Using them for the purpose of self-examination is also false. Violence that the 'higher' may commit in order to introduce and defend a new idea in the world is not at all an indispensable or essential aspect of their mission. Raskolnikov recognizes it himself. However, he hypostases the moment of violence and transgression making it self-sufficient. It is proved that, whereas Raskolnikov set out the canonical theory without any need for his justification, he created the modified version precisely for this purpose, finding a post factum justification for the murder. Being alien to the Zeitgeist, the canonical version transforms into a modified version by forgery and distortion for they are incommensurable. On the contrary, the latter goes into Luzhin's theory and back naturally since they are closely related.

AB The subject of the article is the processes of development of financial law and financial sci-ence in Russia and the Czech Republic.
   The purpose of the study is to establish common and different in the development of the financial and legal doctrine of both countries and to identify current trends in the formation of both branches of public law.
   The methodology. Comparative legal, historical and analytical scientific methods were used. The main results, scope of application. Formation of financial-legal theory in both countries took place under the circumstances of political changes. In relation to the Czechoslovak Republic, the attention is focused on the period from the formation of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918 to the formation of the Czech Republic in 1993, and the main emphasis is made on the period of the 21st century. Periodization of financial law and financial science, and also the system of financial law considers the teaching of financial law and financial science at the Faculty of Law, Charles University. The study also characterizes the process of development of financial law and financial science in pre-revolutionary Russia, highlights the Soviet period of development of financial law, focuses on the problems of development of modern financial law. Periodization of financial law, as well as the system of financial law, are presented from the perspective of teaching of the subject of financial law at the facul-ties of law. The authors suppose that the modern system of financial law and financial sci-ence has retained the original division into two parts, general and specific. All sub-branches of the special part of financial law may be divided into three main blocks: (1) sub-branches of the fiscal part of financial law; (2) sub-branches of the non-fiscal part of financial law; (3) common sub-branches of the non-fiscal part of financial law.
   Conclusions. The hypothesis about the unity of the principles of financial law and financial science, and public finance as the main category, as well as about the independence of this branch of public law was confirmed during the study. Due to the growing volume of legal reg-ulation in both countries, the historical division of the financial law system is not enough, there is an extensive fragmentation of division in the financial law system. We are observing the emergence of new sub-branches, which are likely to tend to the formation of new branches.

TI THE PROBLEM OF SUBJECTIVE FREEDOM IN POLITICAL COMMUNICATION

AB The paper is aimed at studying political communication as a factor of formation of subjectivity. The initial premise is the idea that perverse restrictions on freedom are rooted in infosphere, characterized by the panoptic nature of human being and the ethical uncertainty of the use of personal data. In the modern world, the communicative infrastructure is threatened by two interrelated and mutually complementary tendencies: a systematically conditioned reification and a cultural decline (conformist consciousness). The liberation of the individual from traditional dependencies entails his/her removal from moral landmarks and causes the increase of his/her dependence on the system. The notion of universal truth carries danger of totalitarianism, forcing everybody to think and act according to one pattern. The authors reveal social and ethical foundations of freedom as the basic value, give a phenomenological description of freedom in political communications and determine the conditions of the exercise of liberty in modern society. Arendt's concept of activity is applied for explaining political communication phenomena.

AB The article investigates the question about the possibility of treating contemporary logic with its methods of analysis and its discipline-specific subjects as a tool that can be used efficiently and comfortably by specialists in philosophy. From this point of view, I firstly investigate the methods of the logic of action - one of the branch of contemporary logic - and then demonstrate how the arsenal of the logic of action can be applied in the field of philosophy today. Firstly, I demonstrate the richness of the logic of action methods by expressing with the means of classical semantics of the notion of the agentive degree or the degree of agency. Secondly, by using the set-theoretical approach, I point out the new way of development for the logic of action that lies in the traditional area of philosophical knowledge. Here I argue that it is possible to regard as a new subject for the logic of action the self-ward actions and the structures of so-called agentive domains, or the sets of state of affairs that can be put into existence via agentive actions. In the conclusion, I claim that the logic of action, or, following my proposal, the logic of choice with its methods will be well adopted into the set of investigation practices of those who are professionals in the realm of philosophy.

TI ESCAPE FROM ANTIQUITY: CASE OF G.G. DILIGENSKIY
SO VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA-PERM UNIVERSITY HERALD-HISTORY
LA Russian
DT Article
DE Soviet historiography; ancient history; G.G. Diligenskiy
AB Diligenskiy's case seems difficult to explain: a senior researcher at the Institute of History of the USSR Academy of Sciences in the prime of his career (Ph.D. dissertation defended and published, many publications in Soviet and foreign journals, frequent trips to foreign conferences) quits his subject (history of late antiquity), leaves the institute and switches to the study of the social psychology of the working class in France. A long and difficult conversation with the head of the Sector of ancient history S.L. Utchenko, who obviously considered G.G. Diligenskiy as his possible successor, could not change anything. What prompted the young historian to stop studying late antiquity and leave the ancient history sector of the Institute of History of the USSR Academy of Sciences? The choice of specialization took place in the years complicated by tough campaigns to combat cosmopolitanism, etc. According to the memoirs of M.K. Trofimova, who studied a little earlier, her relatives insisted that she should be engaged in the history of the ancient world or archaeology, as the most secure from an ideological (and practical) point of view historical disciplines. Thus, the choice of the history of antiquity was rather "protective" in nature; antiquity could attract as a relatively safe field for historical research. The era of the "thaw" gave rise to illusions among a part of the Soviet intelligentsia about the possibility of social changes and the improvement of the Soviet socio-political system. The history of antiquity was a field of research too far from modern problems, and the scholar chose another sphere of activity. The works of G.G. Diligenskiy made a very significant contribution to the development of sociological and socio-psychological research in the late USSR, and the "Diligenskiy school" laid the foundations for political scientific research in modern Russia. The Marxist, "Eurocommunist" views of the scholar found better application in the academic but influential Institute of World Economy and International Relations, which made recommendations to the authorities, than in the rather dogmatic sphere of ancient history, where the best way out was not the "improvement" of Marxism, but a radical departure from Marxist dogma.

ID ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE
AB The article summarizes one of the first experiences of using the analysis of students' digital footprints for educational analytics tasks, namely, predicting the formal educational achievements of students. Prediction of educational achievement based on digital footprint data was based on the use of Data Mining and Machine Learning methods. Data Mining methods were used to obtain student digital footprint data. As input data, the user's digital footprint from the social network Vkontakte, as well as data on student academic performance in the LMS Moodle of Tomsk State University, was used. Machine Learning methods were based on the application of the gradient boosting algorithm on decision trees from the CatBoost library. Data were obtained on 6,488 students of Tomsk State University. The sample set was divided into three parts: a training sample (70% of students), a validation sample (10% of students), and a test sample (20% of students). To build the model, the most significant components of the digital footprints of students were selected for determining educational achievements: gender, number of friends, direction of study, user interests - subscriptions. As part of building a predicting model, the following procedures were performed: a) differentiation of students into students with high (average score above the 65th percentile border) and low (average score below the 35th percentile border) educational achievements was implemented; b) the procedure for selecting the most significant features, known as "feature selection", was performed; c) a thematic classification of user subscriptions was carried out according to the following enlarged categories: spiritual life, esotericism; education, science; entertainment, humor; art; healthy lifestyle, sports; socio-political groups; business, work; economy, technology; junk subscriptions. The final quality metric (F-measure) of the final model for predicting high educational achievements became 78% for natural, 73% for technical and 69% for humanitarian areas of study. The conducted research has fixed the specifics of the digital footprint of students with high formal educational achievements. It manifests itself in personal interests, reflected in their subscriptions, as well as in some structural characteristics of the student's Internet activity: the number of membership groups, the number of friends and subscribers. As a result, the analysis of the influence of digital footprints on educational achievements showed that now, at the junction of cognitive and cultural factors, a new type of factors is being formed that affects educational achievements - connective, associated with the peculiarities of the student's online environment.

DE city; "smart city"; pandemic Covid-19
AB The article raises questions about the future of cities, the appearance and infrastructure of which are rapidly changing under the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic. De-globalization and strengthening of regional interaction, which became apparent with the deepening of the pandemic in 2020, brought to the fore discussions about the city's ability to influence current events. The author shows how some of the previous city concepts have been radically revised in conjunction with the discussion of the future of globalization and climate change in the context of the pandemic. New rapidly changing circumstances and "new norms" of life encourage scholars to refine the concepts "city", "city person", "desired image of the city", and rethink various concepts of the city. For example, the concepts of Henri Lefebvre, David Harvey, and others acquire a special meaning. With the outbreak of the pandemic, the city's "right to the city" delineated by these scholars has taken the lead in developing or advocating policy responses to the crisis with the outbreak of the pandemic; the responses were then scaled up at the national level. The pandemic highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of cities, outlined the demand of the population for protection from infections and for comfortable living conditions in the urban space. Considerable attention is paid to the concept of a "smart city" and its content in the noticeably increased pace of digitalization in the world. However, there is a justified skepticism in the expert community about the positive possibilities of a "smart city" for solving problems that arose during the pandemic; for example, protecting citizens, informing them in a timely manner. Experts pay attention to the fact that service providers can only understand most products of a smart city, and smart city products have the problem of information fragmentation. However, the research results used in the article show that the density of cities does not directly correlate with higher infection rates, but the pandemic itself has re-actualized the class basis of Lefebvre's basic theory. The article outlines the main forecasts of changes in the urban space and the development of "smart cities"; some of them have already become reality. The article concludes that the pandemic has had a major impact on the current and future urban planning towards enhancing the safety and convenience of cities for telecommuting and spending time.

DE state; power; law; bureaucracy; democracy
AB The article describes various aspects of the general bureaucratization of modern society and analyzes their legal, political, and epistemological causes and consequences. It also discusses the problems of independence of law, the growth of legal regulation of social relations and processes, etatization of social life and thought, the right to resist power, trends of internalization and democratization of law. According to the research data, over the past hundred years, the sphere of legal regulation of social relations and processes in all states has increased. Given the complexity of establishing the boundaries between legal and bureaucratic regulation, Weber's tradition of social, economic, legal and political thought reinforces the general trend of nationalizing socio-economic life and thought. Throughout the twentieth century, arbitrary power and the desire of the authorities to control the behavior of citizens were embodied in the laws and rights of non-democratic states. In Russia, this trend forms a political tradition. It is reinforced by differences between the European and Russian interpretations of the rights of citizens to resist spiritual and secular power and to carry out a popular revolution. The causes and consequences of the interconnection of legal regulation and bureaucratization throughout the twentieth century consist in the phenomena of "legal wrong" and "supra-legal law", the emergence of new spheres of human activity and the ensuing boom on the topic of security, the elimination of legal remnants of feudal society, long-term dominance in national legislation of the category of duty over the rights of individuals, internationalization of law in all its aspects, the primacy of international law over domestic law, revision of the traditional concept of state sovereignty, liberalization and secularization of law, development of information technologies. These trends give rise to opposite assessments and fail to solve the problem of fairness. A detailed analysis of the authoritarian and totalitarian systems of the twentieth century, which contributed to the total militarization and bureaucratization of society, is further required.

AB This review presents some reflections on the new book by well-known Cossack historian Dmitrii V. Sen' which collects his articles and papers on Northern Black Sea history under new conditions developed when the Ottoman Empire lost the war with the Holy League of European powers, concluded the treatises of Karlowitz and Constantinople, and political initiative in the region passed into the hands of Russia. The author's attention is focused on various individual and collective strategies of adaptation to new life conditions among frontier populations (Crimean Tatars and the Nogais of the steppe, various groups of Cossacks, including those who escaped from the Russian authorities to the areas controlled by Crimean khans). The Russian authorities in the region also had to adapt themselves and learn how to control a complicated borderland country in close contact with the Ottomans, Crimeans, and residents of the North Caucasus. The book uncovers a complicated "mosaic-like" picture of the region where numerous groups and particular persons interacted, each having a specific way of life, interests, aims, and ambitions. The author outlines prospective ways of further research on the eighteenth-century history of the Northern Black Sea Area.

   European cinema
AB In the beginning of the 21st century interest in the phenomenon of the old age has intensified. The use of the term 'Ageing Europe' grew. The main reason for this was the increase in number of pensioners among total European population. The purpose of the paper is to study how social processes in modern Europe are rethought in contemporary cinema. The chronological framework is determined by the recommendations of the European Commission concerning an ageing population. Thus, the authors analysed films and TV shows in the 2000-2010s along the representation of Active Ageing Index indicators. This gave us reason to take as a basis for the analysis a set of indicators used to calculate the active ageing index: employment, participation in society, health and security and enabling environment for active ageing. The main topics in the films about elderly people were identified as: love and family relationships, health, self-realization and reflection of a life lived and death. We came to the following conclusions: modern European cinema reflects current trends for changes in attitudes toward old age; it forms the image of oldness as a full-fledged stage of life filled with heterogeneous experience; old age on the screen does not exclude the joy of life and makes it possible to find new professional and personal social roles. It is dictated by a change in the demographic situation, public opinion, political decisions due to economic processes and social trends. Modern cinematograph has become a mirror that reflects the transformation of attitudes towards older people and also builds the image of an active elderly person included in social life.

AB The review of existing approaches to the study of the problem of language planning is carried out. The features of the implementation of its main aspects are studied. The definitions of the term "language planning" in domestic and foreign sociolinguistics are compared. The activity of actors is studied at the macrolevel and microlevel of language planning. Attention is paid to the goals of language planning, which include not only work on changes in the areas of language use, but also counteraction to the speech shift, which can ultimately lead to the death of the language. Language planning is viewed as a combination of three main areas: status planning, corpus planning and planned language acquisition. The article presents the results of a comparative analysis of these components in relation to some of the title languages of the Russian Federation: Tuvan, Kalmyk and Karelian. It is argued that prestigious planning is the foundation for successful language forecasting. The importance of considering both social and political components in language forecasting is emphasized. The relevance of the study is due to the need to create a base for the subsequent linguistic forecast, which is impossible without an analytical assessment of the existing linguistic situation.

DT Article
DE international division of labor; international trade; direct and
   indirect re-export; transport and logistics infrastructure; consignment
   warehouses; export of goods and services
AB The article aims to determine the essence, role, and significance of re-export in international trade using its opportunities to develop Russian exports and imports. The authors define re-export and its key characteristics, analyze the main factors of re-export trade development, study re-export dynamics compared to the commodity supplies dynamics within the framework of ordinary exports. When exporting highly differentiated goods, it is the role of knowledge about the terms, forms, and trading methods on the international market that increases. Specialized trading companies possess this knowledge; they create large transport and logistics centers in the countries crossing international trade routes, including extensive consignment warehouses.
   The article studies the dynamics of re-export flows and makes calculations, based on which it concludes that the volume of these commercial operations is growing faster in the world market. At the same time, large re-export operations are now performed not only by small states located at the intersection of sea roads but also by large, industrialized states: the USA, Great Britain, Italy, etc.
   The authors conclude that an essential factor in the development of re-export was the growth of trade restrictions imposed primarily for political reasons. Such restrictions apply in trade relations between India and Pakistan, Israel and the Arab countries, between some states of the Persian Gulf, etc. The anti-Russian sanctions adopted in the United States and other Western states inadvertently contribute to the development of re-exports, since many trading companies, including Western ones conducting international commercial operations, do not consider themselves bound by unilateral decisions of the anti-Russian part of the US government. Many US trading companies themselves are actively involved in re-export operations without disclosing partners. Given the undesirability of disseminating information on re-export operations, many countries actively involved in re-export have stopped submitting data on their re- exports to international statistical agencies.
   The authors concentrate on the re-export operation of the United Arab Emirates, where are thousands of trading firms with transport and logistics infrastructure and consignment warehouses. Russia is involved in re- export trade, mainly through the UAE companies, carrying on export and import operations on the world market. The authors conclude that expanding the practice of re-export increases sales of national products in the world market.

DE neoliberal reforms; perestroika; disintegration of the USSR; sociology
   of economists; sociology of political crises; biographical approach
AB The intellectual and social sources of the transition to the "market" and capitalism during the post-Soviet transformation in Russia are often presented as external to the state and its ruling class (nomenklatura). In particular, the "young economists"- members of the "reform government" responsible for implementing extremely unpopular economic liberalization measures - had, according to this narrative, no experience with the Soviet economy and mostly followed the prescriptions of Western economic advisers. This contribution aims to question this thesis of the exteriority of post-Soviet reformers and their ideas by closely following their professional trajectories leading them to high government positions in the late 1980s and 1990s. This analysis reveals that most of these economists were part of the networks of power and expertise within the state apparatus long before the end of the Soviet Union, and that this experience provided them with a specific "reformist capital" that played a decisive role in their paths to power at the turning point of autumn 1991, shortly before the dissolution of the USSR. Thus, this analysis sheds light on the logic of selection and reproduction of intellectual and political elites in the Soviet Union and Russia triggered by the profound crisis of the Soviet system.

AB Introduction. The visit of the Russian envoy Osip Nepeya to London in 1556-1557 is usually considered as the beginning of the official relations between Russia and England. In the light of modern views about the sixteenth-century diplomacy, this event requires a more thorough research. Methods. The Nepeya's trip was traditionally viewed as an insignificant episode in the context of general reviews of bilateral relations concentrated mainly on trade. The reasons and possibilities of the military and political rapprochement between England, Spain and Russia in the 1550s, which was the most likely goal of the Nepeya's journey to England, have never been investigated. Therefore, this article is based on an analysis of numerous multilingual sources. Analysis. The author clarifies the Nepeya's diplomatic rank and certain previously unknown details of the Muscovites' stay in London. He analyzes Nepeya's mission to England in the context of foreign affairs of Ivan IV, Mary Tudor and Philip II Habsburg. Results. It is concluded that the rulers of Spain and England could provide military support to Ivan IV, but they were not interested in military and political alliance with the Muscovy and the war against Turkey. However, establishing official equal relations between England and Russia at the highest level, as well as obtaining trade privileges for Russian merchants was the main result of Nepeya's trip. This allows us to conclude that the first Russian diplomatic mission in London was successful.

AB The article explores the problem of new, non-military challenges for the US in Europe. Previously Washington saw the main regional risks in the military-political sphere. Now serious challenges are emerging in trade, technological and information security. To a large extent, the risks can be associated with the activities of the PRC. The study analyzes the American policy in specific areas (trade, 5G networks, energy exports, relations between allies). The main approaches that Washington can apply to protect its regional interests are as follows: attempts to put pressure on allies by introducing new tariffs and reducing cooperation in several areas; the desire of the US to provide an alternative to the projects of the PRC in the region; deliberate militarization of several topics by the US. But still, the universal instrument is the emphasis on shared values and the issue of human rights. The resolution of bilateral problems between the US and the EU will not fully deal with new risks. Trying to fend off the challenges emanating from the PRC, the US has to partially repeat and duplicate Beijing's policy, creating alternative infrastructure projects or trying to promote its LNG instead of Russian gas.

DE deontic logic; dynamic propositional logic; reductionist semantics;
   normative characteristics of actions; deontic universe
AB The article is a response to some E.V. Borisov's criticism regarding the normative characteristics of actions expressed in the reductionist version of deontic propositional dynamic logic with the propositional constant "sanction". First, the agreement is expressed with the requirement, when defining models for this logic, to state that the binary relations that determine the interpretation of actions must be serial. Second, the need to indicate that the interpretation of the propositional constant "sanction" must be a nonempty proper subclass of the set of possible worlds of the model is accepted. Third, it is agreed to correct the areas of the normative characteristics of actions in the map of deontic universe since Borisov substantiated the absence of strictly indifferent actions in models under consideration. Critical remarks about the necessity of a direct indication of both the seriality of the binary relation that determines the interpretation of actions and the fact that the interpretation area of the propositional constant "sanction" is nonempty and nonuniversal are important. They must be taken into account in further work on the construction and study of the properties of the corresponding deontic logics with the reductionist semantics and other logics of this type. The agreement with the most conceptual remark about the emptiness of the area of strictly indifferent actions is accompanied by an explanation that the concept of "actions normatively indifferent in the strict sense" is interesting from the point of view of interpretation since it distinguishes a class of actions that, both when performing them and when refraining from their fulfillment inevitably, leads to a state of affairs that is not assessed negatively, that is, not to a "sanction". The reductionist approach to the semantic plans of deontic logic based on propositional dynamic logic, the refinement of which led to critical remarks, does not (among other things) solve the problem of preserving the semantic status of strictly indifferent actions. The causes of the errors and the ways of searching for semantic formulations that are more consistent with deontic contexts are analyzed. Among the latter is the search for an adequate semantic formulation of the concept of "refraining from action", as well as a radical rejection of the reductionist semantics with the propositional constant "sanction".

   integration; trade; competition
AB The claim that the center of world economic and political life is moving to the Asia-Pacific region (APR) has been thoroughly reinforced over the past two and a half years in the form of two competing integration megaprojects: the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP, formerly TPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). In the future, due to their gigantic scale, these integration megaprojects can radically change the trade and economic landscape not only in Asia, but also in the world as a whole.
   Japan, as the second economic power in Asia and the third one in the world, intends to make the most effective use of both the CPTPP and the RCEP in order to solve its economic problems, as well as strengthen its own economic and political positions both on the regional and global levels. To do this, Tokyo is striving to take a leading position in both partnerships. Japan's success in achieving its goals in the CPTPP and the RCEP will largely depend on the further course in relation to both integration megaprojects of China and the United States, as well as building its own bilateral trade, economic, and political relations with both world powers. Tokyo believes that the course of the Donald Trump administration to withdraw from the TPP was a mistake and encourages the Joe Biden administration to return to this integration structure. At the same time, Japan takes a very cautious position about the possible entry of China into the CPTPP.
   Both projects (especially the RCEP), as well as their significance for Japan, have not yet received a sufficiently broad and deep understanding in the Russian academic literature in the form of monographic studies or articles. At the same time, much more attention is paid to the two new integration megaprojects in Japan and other countries of the Asia-Pacific region. The article analyzes the views of Japanese and other foreign politicians and experts on the CPTTP and the RCEP, and an attempt is made to identify the role and significance of both projects for Japan and other states.

Among the important characteristics of "electoral autocracies" the following are highlighted: the presence of a multi-party system, regular parliamentary elections, universal suffrage and other important components of the democratic landscape. The empirical part clarifies the political and economic aspects of election campaigns in the Russian regions. To that purpose, 76 in-depth semi-structured interviews with the main agents of the electoral process in the Russian regions were conducted (ranging from political strategists to a representative of a regional administration). The study covers several main aspects: the formation of the market for political professions in modern Russia; sources of recruitment; the socio-economic status of political strategists; and the features of post-career professional trajectories. The analysis reveals that the formation of a community of political strategists in modern Russia is not yet complete, and election campaigns are a two-pronged process where the boundaries between political business and political process are blurred and the main aspect is not the quality of the provided services but the durability of the process itself.

AB Manifestations of political bias in media coverage of political events abroad, despite a large volume of research, have been only partially investigated. First, relevant studies nearly never examine how such coverage might be affected by conflicts between the countries whose media are studied and the countries covered by these media, as compared to non-conflict configurations. Second, systematic bias is usually seen as an attribute of a country's media system as a whole, without attempts to investigate differences between specific media types within the same country. In this paper, we take a first step to address these gaps by studying how framing of elections in a country that has no conflict with Russia (Kazakhstan) and a country that does have such conflict (Ukraine) varies in different types of Russian media: those controlled by the state, liberal-oppositional and politically neutral. For this purpose, 30 popular online news outlets were selected and divided into the three aforementioned types by experts. From the totality of the news published in these media, we formed a sample of 792 news items devoted to the presidential elections in Ukraine and in Kazakhstan, so that all three media types would be equally represented. All news items were labeled into one of three framing types: pro-government, liberal and neutral. Prevalence of one of the extreme framing types in a given group of media was considered as a manifestation of systematic bias. The research has shown that pro-government bias is observed only in one, albeit dominant, group of media outlets - those controlled by the state. In the other two groups it is the neutral frame that prevails, suggesting that a large portion of the Russian audience has access to a non-pro-government way of framing international political events. However, the coverage of Ukrainian and Kazakhstan elections has been found to be visibly different. In the coverage of Ukraine, the distribution of shares of all three frame types in all three groups of media is shifted in the pro-government direction compared to the coverage of Kazakhstan. Simultaneously, texts by the oppositional media about Kazakhstan turn out to be the only group of news where the liberal frame prevails (and, therefore, the liberal bias is observed). The coverage of a non-conflict country appears to be more polarized than that of a country which has a conflict with the country of the studied media. A number of interpretations for this observation are given in the paper.

AB The Serbs' national self-organisation in the Habsburg monarchy from 1690 to 1867 underwent significant changes in the course of interaction with the Hungarian elites (county administrations, the Catholic clergy, deputies of the Diet). Periodicals, political writings, ego-documents and other sources demonstrate how the Serbian-Magyar conflict against the background of the Austrian authorities' interference into the inter-ethnic relations resulted in the making of a "survival strategy" in the composite monarchy and crystallisation of a specific political culture of the Serbs, based on a stable antipathy to the triumph of the concept of "natio Hungarica". The article presents a new look at mobilisation of the Serbian community in the context of forced integration, the most effective means of which were the popularisation of traumatic experience of relationships with the titular nation and its stigmatisation by using the "hate speech" in the propaganda campaign launched by Serbian liberals in 1866-1872.

DE externalism; McKinsey argument; disjunctivism; privileged access; theory

AB This article aims to show that, contrary to what Fred Dretske in Naturalizing the Mind and some others are claiming, compatibility between externalism and Privileged Access to Attitude Content (PAC) is one of the basic problems. It describes some approaches to the solution of this problem which follow from admitting the validity of Michael McKinsey's reductio ad absurdum argument. McKinsey has outlined the challenge for externalists which concerns illusion of sameness of meaning in his 1991 paper "Anti-Individualism and Privileged Access". In Putnam's Twin Earth case, speakers of both earths enjoy the following illusion: "water" means something different on Earth and on Twin-Earth, but this difference might not be accessible to them. The punch line of McKinsey's case runs as follows: if the contents of our thoughts are determined in part by our relations to the environment, then one might think that external observations are needed in order to know what we think. But self-knowledge does not come about through empirical investigations. So either contrary to appearance we do not really know the contents of our own thoughts, or, if we do, externalism is false. If both externalism and the thesis of privileged access were true, then we could have a priori knowledge of certain contingent matters of empirical fact. But the idea that we could have such a priori knowledge is absurd; therefore, one or both externalism and the thesis that we have privileged access to our own mental states are false. The paradox comes with the claim that if thesis of privileged access and externalism are knowable a priori, then we can know contingent external propositions (e.g. that "Water exists") a priori as well. We get this from a plausible principle: the set of things we know is closed under entailment, so we know that a given claim is true upon recognizing, and accepting thereby, that it follows from what we know. To avoid commitment to such an absurd consequence externalists like Michael Tye who endorse PAC commit themselves to rejecting the a priori status of externalism. An argumentation in this vein is supposed to run into the problem raised by Paul Boghossian in "What the Externalist Can Know A Priori". I argue that it is controversial whether the inhabitants of Dry Earth possess the concept of water. I outline a version of strong or concept-possession externalism which evades this kind of issues.

DE educational migration; internationalization; higher education management
AB The main research field of this article is some key features of the organization of the educational process for educational migrants who came to study at the National Research Tomsk State University (TSU) through the prism of sociocultural processes in the Russian segment of the international educational services market. The paper briefly describes the main compliance parameters with international standards of educational migration for the Russian Federation and Tomsk in particular, as a local educational center. The historical and statistical justification of the vast external educational flows of Tomsk is also given, as well as the main characteristics of the social portrait of an educational migrant who want to study in Tomsk universities.
   The second part of the paper consists of a questionnaire analysis conducted among foreign students of TSU about the educational process organization (for example of the faculty of historical and political sciences). The aim of the study was to elucidate the main aspects of the educational process that are significant for this category of students, as well as to identify the reasons and motives for their admission. It was also found that most surveyed students are satisfied with the organization and quality of the learning environment. Among the significant issues are the following: the set of offered courses, the optimal number of hours for learning the Russian language, as well as an individual approach to the learning process. On the other hand, the study showed that the educational activities of educational migrants are often not limited only to the academic field, it covers the main aspects of life and contributes to the comprehensive development of the student's personality. In this case, about half of the respondents noted that teachers are limited solely by their course and do not conduct any adaptation or educational work with students. Nevertheless, this fact does not mean that the moral and ethical aspect is missing in the educational process at the university: the work of curators and volunteers is quite developed in TSU, which helps students successfully adapt to new realities. The faculty itself also has several special courses closely related to professional and intercultural communication, where students are immersed in the study of everyday socio-cultural environment.
   Thus, the educational process at TSU for educational migrants covers all the basic aspects of students' life and is generally aimed at the harmonious development of personality and professional growth of a future specialist.

DE process; event; Alfred North Whitehead; Nicholas Rescher; Edmund Husserl
AB The temporal representation of the world is its representation in the form of processes and events. The philosophy of the process was developed in the 20th century, although it originates from Heraclitus. Its representatives are A.N. Whitehead, N. Rescher, Russian logicians A.V. Smirnov and V.I. Shalak. Res.her introduces the concept of structure of the process, which is understood as a repeating pattern, but it seems that a change that does not have a regular structure is also a process. Ch.D. Broad and W. Sellars speak about the "absolute process" that does not have a subject, but this description is carried out in a linguistic, rather than physical, manner. Essential and incidental processes are also distinguished: the essential process is inalienable from the corresponding substrate, the incidental may be absent. Causality in a process ontology is a sequence of processes; the output of one is the input of the other. Rescher and Shalak are proponents of a continuum understanding of processes, according to which any process can be infinitely divided into subprocesses. Whitehead identifies process units - actual entities. The main issue discussed in the article is about the relationship between the process and the event. The anthropocentric aspect of the event is emphasized, its connection with the being of man, with sense, although there are some works in which the event is considered as something objective. In the article, the author suggests considering the event as a discrete point in the process at which the function jumps. However, events are distinguished only by the observer, "in nature" any event can be considered as a short process. Consciousness is analyzed as a process and it is indicated that one purely temporal process cannot adequately perceive the second process, floating within the same time. Two processes running in parallel do not perceive each other as processes. However, the human consciousness has the ability to go, in reliance on retention and memory, beyond the point hic et nunc, in such a way that the time of the world is perceived as current. Consciousness also has the ability to convolve process patterns that were initially broached in time.

DE radiophysics; Tomsk State University; Siberian Institute of Physics and
   Technology; scientific community; center-periphery; modernization theory
AB Based on the materials of office documentation and memoirs of contemporaries, the article attempts a methodological understanding of the theory of center-peripheral relations as applied to the study of the scientific community of radiophysicists in Tomsk in the first half of the 20th century. It is emphasized that certain provisions of the modernization theory, critically rethought taking into account the Soviet socio-political realities, can claim the role of a tool for rethinking.
   We note that the institutionalization of radiophysical research in Siberia and the formation of the Tomsk radiophysical community on its basis are inextricably linked with the problem of regionalization of domestic science and higher education and the restructuring of the country's scientific and educational potential. It is emphasized that in the 1920s-1930s the formation of the Tomsk radiophysical community proceeded both "from above" - through the implementation of the state scientific-technical and scientific-educational policy through the opening of scientific and educational institutions, and "from below" - through self-organization and coordination of efforts of representatives of the local teaching corporation and members of the radio amateur movement. Since the early 1930s, the leaders of the community have come to the fore: V.N. Kessenikh and A.B. Sapozhnikov, who became the founders of the radiophysical school at TSU and SPTI.
   We also note that the Great Patriotic War gave impetus to the development of alternative forms of organizing scientific activities. One of them was the Tomsk Committee of Scientists - an accelerator for the development of all kinds of inventions, discoveries and rationalization proposals, which was based on design methods for conducting interdisciplinary research, which made it possible to find the shortest ways to industrialize their results.
   In the 1950s - 1960s, Tomsk residents reached the borderline of radiophysical research, which was a sign of the fifth technological order. However, it was not possible to fully implement the obtained developments, focused on direct practical application, due to the systemic rejection from the center-peripheral vertical of everything that did not fit into the already formed management system.
   We conclude that there is a natural connection between the institutionalization of radiophysics in the universities of Tomsk and the implementation of the concepts of regionalization of science within the framework of the mobilization paradigm adopted in the USSR. Within the boundaries of bilateral interaction between the leaders of the university corporation and the main actor of modernization, represented by the state, Tomsk radio physics and radio electronics directly influenced the structural parameters of regional science, which, in turn, determined the transformation of the scientific and educational space of Siberia.

DE large families; social networks; collective support networks; public

AB Large families are one of the most vulnerable social groups in Russian society due to the deterioration of their socioeconomic situation with the birth of each subsequent child. This situation makes them need to seek help not only from formal social institutions (primarily state ones) for help, but also to engage a wide range of informal ties. Despite quite a lot of research in this area, a single definition of the concept of social networks and support networks has not been worked out. Collective social networks of large family support are based on interactions between agents not related by blood relations. "Live" support networks for large families can have varying degrees of formalization: these can be informal "interest clubs" or formalized (officially registered) public associations. The second version of multi-child family support networks is "virtual" networks, which can be specialized in nature - aimed exclusively at large families, or focus on some area, for example, parenthood. Formalization of the social support network allows it to attract more agents and resources. Collective social networks can be quite diverse in terms of their characteristics - size, geographic concentration, etc. The scale of such networks can vary significantly - from local to regional and federal. The key elements of support networks are social agents. Recipients in collective social networks of large family support are, first of all, large families that find themselves in difficult life circumstances. Donors may be commercial and non-profit organizations, authorities and institutions, as well as individual households (including large families themselves). In some cases, recipients become "exchanging" or donors over time. Reciprocal transfers in collective support networks for large families are quite diverse. The main resources of reciprocal exchanges are: services aimed at protecting the rights of large families; information; material resources (products, clothes, shoes, other things); intangible resources related to the organization of communication, leisure and training, psychological support.

AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the concept of supreme power, which, according to the author, is undeservedly neglected by the modern Political Science. Despite the high importance of this concept, its definition is lacking in dictionaries, as well as most textbooks and reviews.
   Legal Science and State Studies have known this concept at least since the 16th century. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, due to the works of such scientists as Boris Chicherin, Alexander Alekseev, Nikolay Korkunov, Georg Jellinek, Lev Tikhomirov, Petr Kazansky the academic consensus was formed that supreme power can be defined as legally unlimited, complete and unconditional power in the state. At the beginning of the 21st century, the interest in this category has revived, which resulted, in particular, in the previous concepts becoming relevant again.
   After having critically analyzed the existing ideas of the Russian researchers on this topic, the author comes to the conclusion that elaboration of the relevant theory of the supreme power that lives up to the modern level of knowledge, requires interdisciplinary approach and combined effort from lawyers, political scientists, historians, and sociologists. Having convincingly demonstrated that today this task is still far from being complete, he focuses on a number of key problems for the development of such a theory and outlines possible directions for finding their solution. According to his conclusion, the category "supreme power" has a significant heuristic potential, and its "return" to political, as well as constitutional and legal, science would enrich their methodological tools. In particular, its application to the analysis of political systems makes it possible to discern behind the facade of the constitutional separation of powers not only who governs (i.e., exercises this or that authority granted by the constitution), but also who rules i.e., has the right to make final decisions on key issues of political life.

AB The purpose of the article is to critically analyze and generalize the historiographical material devoted to the study of the process of gradual introduction of mathematical methods, methods of informatization and digitalization, computer technology into the everyday life of one of the most humanitarian sciences-history. Based on a number of studies, the history of the introduction ofmathematical methods for working with mass historical sources is considered. It is impossible not to note the huge contribution of the outstanding Russian source historian, academician I.D. Kovalchenko, his colleagues and followers who paved theway for the introduction of computer technology in historical research. For the first time in the Russian historiography devoted to this problem, the authors raise the question of the entry of modern humanity into a time of actively developing contradictions between new high-tech digital means of production and industrial and social relations lagging behind technological progress, with the resulting socioeconomic, political and cultural consequences. Some elements of this process have been noted by many researchers in different countries, primarily in terms of the risks that the introduction of digitalization, robotics and artificial intelligence in our lives, especially in the economy. The authors believe that in this case we may not be talking about risks, most of which are historically usually overcome, but, and in this they rely on the opinion of modern researchers in this field, about changing the model of socio-economic development of mankind in General. As for the problem of correlation between historical science and digitalization, generalizing the views of most modern specialists in the field of application of Informatization and digitalization in historical research, it is impossible to completely replace a person in historical and other Humanities.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE N.D. Akhsharumov; Siberian text; constants and variables; fable and
   plot; secondary and alternativeness; Russian literature of the 19th
   century; Dostoevsky
AB The article examines the phenomenon of spatial imagination in the plot and composition of the allegorical story by the critic and writer, member of the Petrashevsky Circle Nikolai Dmitrievich Akhsharumov. Turning to the most generalized Siberian topos and ignoring the numerous ethnographic information accumulated both in periodicals and in special studies, the writer constructs a dystopian plot, drawing on the novels by N.G. Chernyshevsky and F.M. Dostoevsky. Special attention should be paid to the polemic of Akhsharumov with the novel Crime and Punishment, which began in a critical article and continued beyond its borders, in a literary text. Akhsharumov begins his work from the point and coordinates where Crime and Punishment actually ends. When in a Siberian settlement, a gold digger and hunter, a former convict Lazar implements an educational project: he gives animals a language (according to the method of Robertson and Wundt) and law, teaches them the social principles of community and creates a kind of phalanstery. The social experiment gets out of control and ends in failure: "citizens of the forest" begin to worship the personified symbol of animal primal fear - the Great Fly totem. An uprising flares up to defeat a forcibly cultivated democracy, which yields to authoritarianism and totemism. By choosing the totem of the Great Fly, the forest dwellers finally lose their civic consciousness, appearing in their natural form and at the same time showing that there is no place for people, whoever they are, in their world (neither for life, nor, especially, for resurrection). Like most dystopias, Citizens of the Forest demonstrates several phases of a social project: the formation of a civil society, its heyday and fall. Akhsharumov shows how the harmony of the animal world flings itself on mercy of one person and the word given to him; how the mass instinct (instincts of survival, reproduction, etc.) prevails over the needs of each individual (cattle or creature, as follows from the text). Citizens of the Forest creates an alternative value architectonics, due to which the life path of the protagonist, largely corresponding to the Old Testament, personifies the non-possibility of the resurrection miracle. The article attempts to describe not only intertextual links to political literature, utopias of Fourier, Cabet and Owen, dystopias in the spirit of Hobbes' Leviathan, but also biographical lines associated with portraits of the writer's brother, Fourierist Dmitry Akhsharumov, and M.V. Butashevich-Petrashevsky. Akhsharumov created space from scratch. Turning to the most primitive model of the Siberian text, and starting from strong texts (most likely, Voinarovsky and Crime and Punishment), Akhsharumov intuitively determined its two limits: a short novel, which begins as a story of the New World, ends with a descent into the kingdom of the dead. Siberia, which became a part of an ideological project and showed opportunities for a utopian perception, turned out to be reversible and easily transposed into a dystopia. Thus, despite the low aesthetic quality and numerous formal flaws, Citizens of the Forest remains one of the most significant evidences of spatial imagination, allowing to see in the choice of topos both ideological (from Icaria to Phalanstery) and conditionally biographical equestrianism (from family legends to political jokes). Siberia, as a space of imagination becomes the topos of an experiment continued by the writer in his fantastic story "Wanzamia", directly replicating Cabet's "Icaria".

AB The article analyzes the specifics of the construction of the "social" in the project of the City of Ladies in the book of the same name by Christine de Pizan. The relevance of the research is determined by the pioneering contribution of the woman-thinker of the Renaissance in the discussions that unfold around the comprehension of the present and imaginary social structure. Analyzing the meaning, essence, nature and features of the construction of the "City of Ladies" in Christine de Pizan's project, the authors identify and analyze epistemological grounds, logical justifications, arguments and historical evidence of the ability of women to be subjects of social life. The revision of the peripatetic and theological foundations of the medieval picture of the world by Christine de Pizan leads to the expansion of the concept "social" by including women as full members of society. The authors of the article propose to consider the City of Ladies as a special intelligible construction that discursively allows integrating women into the social order. The meaning of the project of the City of Ladies is to harmonize the social world by changing the masculine view of society on the nature of women. Addressing a broad socio-historical context through allegorical forms, Christine offers a conceptual reassessment of the social order. Christine creates the City as a special symbolic order by building a "female view" of the nature of the sexes, giving women the status of the subject of knowledge, activity, history. The description of the imaginary City for women allows Christine to speak on behalf of the collective subject - the female community. The inclusion of women as full participants in social life is realized by rethinking the value of men's and women's activities, giving importance to women's activities related to the upbringing of children, as well as by increasing women's access to education. The imaginary City allows us to expand the concept "social" by including a new social community - women.

DE human in economics; humanistic problems; techno-economics; alienation;
   dehumanization; human capital
AB The article aims to comprehend humanistic problems in modern society, the solution of which largely depends on understanding the human being's role in current socio-economic processes. Various and ambivalent processes in economics are rather unclear in their consequences and make our society enhance the importance of the humanistic component of progress to promote both the material wellbeing growth and the humanity's personal, spiritual development. The theoretical and practical problem of the research is the contradiction between a human's self-perception as a person with their special intellectual and creative potential and the role a person plays in modern economics. On the basis of economic development logic, the human's secondary role and dependence of people's lifestyle on technological and economic processes are explained. In the context of the human's role as a production resource, such fundamental universal human problems as alienation, economic unfreedom and dehumanization are actualized. These problems are investigated in the following patterns: separation of the human capital from human being, the impact of techno-economics on an individual's choice in almost all life spheres, the blurred personal and social boundaries, the mixed personal and professional identification, the increasing interpersonal competition in the labor world, and personality's capitalization. Alienation and unfreedom are great contributors to the suppressed human feeling, to the dissonance between personal aspirations and environmental foundations. The described problems determine the expediency of reorienting the innovation paradigm of socio-economic development into a humanistic one with fundamentally different target guidelines. The most urgent scientific task in this sense is the conceptualization of the humanistic direction under the information economy concept, which is a modern form of innovative development.

AB Me activities of one of the typical representatives of the Russian regional bureaucracy of the second half of the 19th - early 20th centuries - Viktor Vilhelmovich von Wal as governor of Vilnius province, which he held from 1901 to 1902 is examined in the article. Particular attention is paid to the circumstances of his appointment to this position, which was due to attempts at administrative reorganization of the management of the northwestern outskirts of Russia. A brief analysis of the socio-political situation that had developed by the beginning of the 20th century in the Vilnius province is given and it is indicated that the most acute problem during this period was the active labor movement, which had a mixed socio-ethnic character in the region. It is concluded that the management model implemented by von Wahl, which was based on the traditional administrative-power dominant, did not correspond to the situation in the region and provoked an increase in the degree of violence in the province. It is noted that, despite the short-term tenure of von Waal as governor of Vilna, it had a number of important consequences, demonstrating the premature liquidation of the institution of the governor-general in the region and the need to soften the administrative policy towards the local population.

DE Saint-Simon; French philosophy; socialism; Napoleon; social philosophy
AB The article analyses Saint-Simon's ideas about the mechanism of transition to social reorganization, which he saw as the main content of his contemporary era. Starting with the Letters of Geneva Resident to Contemporaries in the plans of the philosopher a special, exclusive place was given to Napoleon. Saint-Simon expected to strike, attract with his ideas a new star who rose on a political skyscraper. He judged from a belief in the linear, logical-defined course of history. Napoleon was present in the mind of the philosopher as a hero who overcame the negative consequences of the French Revolution, almost the only one able to comprehend easily innovative ideas concerning the transformation of society. In the initial version of Saint-Simon's philosophy of history, he acts as a necessary element to cement the past with the future. In the time of the First Empire Saint-Simon's admiration of Napoleon increases, along with his genius is glorified his invincibility as the greatest of people and his coming world conquest. Following this event, the theorist of socialism expects a genius to turn to the sciences and issues of reforming society in the way he predicted. He regarded the "Emperor's Tribunal" as the highest, most authoritative instance to appeal to resolve worldview collisions. The Restoration cardinally changes the philosopher's attitude to Napoleon's personality. His role in history for socialist's consciousness is no longer progressive, but rather conservative. But the general principle - the search for support for his projects from the head of state - is not rejected by Saint-Simon. Now he appeals to Louis XVIII and in general to European monarchs. The bet on a peaceful way of moving to a new, fairer structure, dictated a series of attempts by the philosopher to build a dialogue with the representatives of power.

   Ages; prototowns; nonferrous metal industry and metalworking; trade

AB In her research M. G. Ivanova raised various questions concerning the Middle Age history of Udmurtia. One of them is the question of origins of prototown settlements which were craft, trade and political centres on the territory. The Idnakar settlement used to play the key role among the prototowns of the day. In her work a lot of attention is paid to craft activities characterization, among others non-ferrous metalworking. Very similar cultural and historical processes may be observed on the territory of Central Preduralye - its Udmurt and Perm areas. Today's research shows that metal workers in Central Preduralye produced copper alloys, cast ingots and exported these as trade goods. Alongside furskins, metal as a strategic raw material was one of the most sought-after trade items. Local artisans made some impressive achievements in non-ferrous metalworking - metal casting, gold-work, and copper smithy. Non-ferrous metal industry and metalworking, traditional among the Finno-Ugrian population, was much less dependent on craft centres of large feudal states than thought previously. However, it was clearly under the influence of these centres. Local production of various everyday items and decorations using non-ferrous materials is confirmed by many traces of mass craft production in prototown centres, and in Idnakar in particular. It is brightly manifested by the large number of specialized workshops that have been found across the Penn Region in recent years. Today it is beyond any doubt that there were in Central Preduralye regional centres of copperware production - particularly of cauldrons - as well as a peculiar Bulgar-Kama gold-work school whose items have peculiar unique features. Thanks to largescale research at key Middle-Age sites, our views changed dramatically on specific features of metalworking in Central Preduralye and the import ratio on these territories among the unearthed Middle-Age artefacts.

AB Since 1993, after the collapse of Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic and Georgia began to build bilateral relations. Geographic remoteness, weak economic contacts did not contribute to the expansion of bilateral cooperation. The author points out that the Czech Republic from the very beginning has been supporting Georgia's territorial integrity, standing for official Tbilisi in its conflict with Abkhazia and South Ossetia. This topic has not found wide coverage in modern scientific literature. The article outlines the current situation in the South Caucasus, the policy of the European Union in the region and Georgia's integration into the world economic and political space. In 2008, the EU and its individual members intensified their policy in the field of expanding cooperation with the states of the South Caucasus, including Georgia, which has significantly advanced towards building a civil society. The Czech Republic, taking an interest in the uninterrupted supply of energy resources through the territory of Georgia, seeks to stabilize the situation inside the country and on its external borders. The author concludes that relations between the Czech Republic and Georgia develop not only within the framework of expanding contacts between the EU and Tbilisi.

AB This article aims at applying the approaches peculiar to analytic philosophy to the question about representation of the concept of time as a symbol which can reflect the bases of the modern natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. The main methods, which the author of this article uses, are speculative analysis and modeling. The symbolic meaning of the concept of time demonstrates preconditions for the organization of the bases of the natural sciences, and social and humanitarian knowledge as well. Judgments for the meaning of time reveal the essence of the problem in two aspects of discussion on the dissociation of the foundations in the modern philosophy of physics and the philosophical analysis of the humanities as well. 1) The formation of the image of human nature in contemporary philosophy reveals the special role of the concept of time in epistemology and philosophy of science. 2) This research reveals the perspective of understanding natural and cultural processes, which is based on the unification of branches of science. As a result, the research shows the basics of communication of the natural sciences with the social science, and humanitarian knowledge as well. This way, the problem of whether time is a natural process or it is only a human invention can be solved. In general, time is not exhausted by the meaning of either of the understandings, and acts as one of the artificial measures people apply. In the same way, the solution of another problem is reached: the modern discrepancy between separate bases of science decreases considerably, if not disappears completely.

AB The world system is undergoing a period of transfonnation and refragmentation, the disintegration of a single political space into spheres of influence formed by the great powers. India, which forms such a sphere around itself, is faced with the problem: a serious economic and military lag behind China, trying, following the ideas of the Indian elites, to achieve hegemony in Southeast and South Asia and the Indian Ocean region. To fend off these attempts, India has put forward two concepts: Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) and the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI).
   The article is devoted to the analysis of the problems that New Delhi is trying to solve with the help of these concepts, and the consideration of the very process of their implementation. The author notes that both SAGAR and IPOI are not developed strategic documents, but a type of 'vision' typical for Indian foreign policy discourse. At the same time, the active assistance provided by India to the countries of the Indian Ocean region within the framework of SAGAR demonstrates that India perceives these countries as part of its sphere of influence and is trying to tie them to itself both politically and economically. On the contrary, the concept of ITOI aims to form partnerships and informal alliances with ASEAN countries and Australia. The author believes that Indian regional concepts are of interest to Russia. allowing it to use the Indian experience and to participate in Indian initiatives.

AB Introduction. The first major crisis of the international relations system founded in Vienna after Napoleonic wars emerged with the series of European revolutions of 1848-1849 and Crimean War of 1853-1856. Not only diplomatic alliances required to be re-evaluated, but also politicians and thinkers challenged the philosophical foundations of the world order. As Russia was the guarantor of the old system, and the United States appeared as an attractive model for the European revolutionaries, the debate on the new world order involved re-assessment of the two countries respective roles and of their future relations. Methods and materials. The article examines books on the subject written during 1850s by four prominent thinkers: American aspiring politician Henry Winter Davis, Russian diplomat Alexei Evstafiev, Polish emigre and American journalist Adam Gurowski and Russian political emigre Ivan Golovin. Analysis. They provided four different visions of the future of the world, and, while never mentioning each other, produced a polyphonic sound of the important debate on the eve of the American Civil War. Results. Bipolarity of the international system predicted by Davis became a fact only a century later, while criticism and praise to American role as a model and an intervening power in European affairs became a constant feature of any subsequent debate.

AB The article highlights three stages of the formation of multinationals from developing countries. Although first Argentine TNCs appeared at the turn of the 19th - 20th centuries, in the majority of the Global South countries TNCs appeared in the 1960s - 1980s. With the collapse of the bipolar world order, which in many developing countries was accompanied by significant internal political and economic transformations, the second stage of foreign expansion of TNCs from the Global South began. Indeed, in 1990 they accounted for 6 % of global outward foreign direct investment stock, while the figure was 10 % by the end of 2005. We date the beginning of the third stage to the financial and economic crisis of 2007-2009, since multinationals from developing countries as a whole are more successfully overcoming the period of turbulence in the global economy. By the end of 2020, they accounted for 22 % of global outward foreign direct investment stock, and during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis they generally exported more than 50% of the capital. The modern foreign expansion of such TNCs has many reasons, differs greatly from country to country, and often differs slightly from the specifics of Western multinationals. At the same time, initially, "late internationalization" in developing countries had two main vectors - the use of new opportunities for South - South cooperation and overcoming, through the creation of subsidiaries in highly developed countries, the shortcomings of the business environment of "catching up" countries.

AB Ukrainian art provides unique examples of challenging bordering policies in the geopolitical context of the war in Donbas. Employing critical borders studies and the perspective of feminist geopolitics, this paper looks at borders beyond territories, including discursive landscapes of power and intersectionality. It focuses on the role of art in post-Maidan Ukraine as a response to political violence and bordering, and the relations between art and bordering work in nongovernment-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine. It argues that feminist art, through practices of "seeing as a border," brings a more intimate geopolitical perspective to audiences' understandings of the lived experiences of civilians residing in the nongovernment territories of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Through analysis of Alevtina Kakhidze and Maria Kulikovska's art, the research demonstrates how the geographical gaze towards art and its role in dis-bordering add to the understanding of space and resistance.

DE Ludwig Wittgenstein; theory of symbolism; paradox; theory of types;
   language; thought; self-reference
AB The article presents a critical analysis of early Ludwig Wittgenstein's theory of symbolism. The authors argue that this theory cannot be a universal way of solving paradoxes. The theory of symbolism is a development exclusively in the field of the functioning of the sign system of the language, while in set-theoretical paradoxes, for example, in Russell's Paradox and The Burali-Forti Paradox, linguistic problems are not at all touched upon. The authors of the article carry out a critical analysis of Wittgenstein's theory of symbolism by analogy with the criticism of Alfred Tarski's concept of metalanguages presented in modern logical literature. The authors argue that the concept of metalanguages was needed by A. Tarski only because he presented The Liar paradox as an exclusively linguistic paradox. If Tarski had introduced the distinction between language and thought, then The Liar paradox could have been avoided without invoking the concept of metalanguages. Wittgenstein's theory of symbolism also speaks of the hierarchy of language signs, as well as Tarski's concept of metalanguages. According to Wittgenstein, paradoxes are also resolved by hierarchy, like according to Tarski. However, the theory of symbolism, like Tarski's concept of metalanguages, completely leaves the level of thinking without consideration. Is the idea of hierarchy necessary to solve the problem of paradoxes? Is it possible to solve the problem of paradoxes using the idea of hierarchy? The theory of symbolism cannot answer these questions if paradoxes are interpreted not only as facts of language, but also as facts of thinking. A critical argument against the theory of symbolism is also the fact that the late Wittgenstein recognizes the phenomenon of self-reference in language. This directly contradicts the main theses of Wittgenstein's concept of the early period of his philosophical activity.

   political orientations; request for change; political involvement
ID PROTEST
AB The article tests the hypothesis, based on the concept of post-industrial society that people with higher education will be more politically active, especially in the manifestation of the demand for change. For this purpose, the materials of the All-Russian poll, organized in March 2021 by the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, are used to analyze the sociopolitical characteristics associated with political activism and the formation of a demand for change among different educational groups of Russians. The conclusion is made that, first, education in modern Russia does directly affect an individual's preparedness for political action: more educated Russians are more interested in the political life of the country and are more aware of their ability to influence the "rules of the game". Second, education does directly affect actual involvement in social and political activism. However, concerning conscious political participation, this effect relates not so much to everyday, regular, as to its extreme protest forms. Third, the education of Russians has no discernible correlation with the presence/absence of a liberal demand for change. In terms of meeting the minimum requirements for political participation, Russian educational groups currently correspond to the Western political science mainstream theory and the practices of developed countries. Nevertheless, the highlighted features of the political characteristics of Russians with higher and post-higher education (not all of the examined indicators are stable in dynamics, not all differences between educational groups are clearly expressed, and, in general, the participation of highly educated Russians in the political life of the country is rather formal) lead to the need for a more careful study of the findings not only of the Western scientific mainstream but also of alternative concepts of Third World researchers. In addition, it has been suggested that the emancipation of a group of highly educated Russians from the state is incomplete. Consequently, they are aware of their objectively central place and leading role in political life.

AB In this work, we show the formation and development of socio-economic studies in the northern periphery. The authors reflect the role of economic science and regional management in the development of territories with difficult natural conditions. During the time of capitalist colonization, socialist planned economy, revolutionary reform and the formation of market relations, scientific recommendations, regarding the forms of organizing production and improving the economic mechanism by the authorities, as a rule, were not received properly and on time. Nevertheless, as shown in the article, all scientific concepts and theories, despite a delay, somehow influenced (and are influencing) vital activity of the population of distant regions, but especially it influences the theory of initial capital accumulation, socialist accumulation, mobilization economy, regional organization of productive forces, economic federalism, a variety of forms of ownership and mixed economy, territorial management. Science forms the theoretical basis for objectively determined social transformations, which serves as a reference point for the accelerated development of productive forces and the growth of people's well-being. However, political activity often ends up in completely opposite positions, preferring to break existing economic relations to the detriment of public interests. On the other hand, the very socio-economic reality and various circumstances of life suggest the need to introduce new theoretical propositions into science, corresponding to the cyclical nature of the market economy, the diversity of its forms, and extreme political and economic situations. At the same time, the experience of the formation of economic relations in various regions is gaining significant importance that is recommended to consider in the entire problematics of research of the national and world economy.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE The Northern Union; Peter I; the Nystad Peace Treaty; Sweden; Russia
AB The article is devoted to studying the role and significance of the Nystad Peace as a historical document reflecting the strengthening and importance of Russia in the world arena.
   The article studies the document's text using modern methods of political science research: content analysis, cognitive mapping, phonosemantic analysis. It shows that the Treaty of Nystad reflects the features of the formation of the internal political system of Russia, witnessed in the use of anthroponyms. It also reflects the features of the historical development of Russia: its gradual transformation into an empire, the absence of a banking system, merchants as an estate, a merchant fleet.The analysis of the document allows us to conclude that the agreement regulates interactions not only between Russia and Sweden but contains references to other European countries. It speaks of Russia's strengthening role in the international arena, not so much in the military but also in diplomatic terms. It is reflected in the ways the agreement is verbalized.
   The results of the phonosemantic analysis show a positive perception of the toponymy of geographic entities annexed to Russia under the terms of the Nystad Peace. At the same time, the perception of Sweden and everything Swedish is characterized by negativism. Nystad peace was vital for the development of Russia, its transformation into an empire, into an influential military force, for the modernization of the domestic governance system, the creation of new social institutions and practices, and the strengthening of domestic diplomacy.

DE Japan; deepfakes; artificial intelligence (AI); information and
   psychological security; malicious use
AB The rapid development of artificial intelligence has spurred the emergence of a number of new technologies, including the deepfake technology, which allows synthesizing very realistic fake video and audio content. This technology, which appeared quite recently, in 2017, has rapidly advanced in just a few years: fake content has become more realistic, deepfake applications have become cheaper and more accessible, allowing users without special computer qualifications to synthesize fake videos in a matter of seconds. It has resulted in the exponential growth of deepfakes in cyberspace.
   Opening up fundamentally new opportunities for a whole range of industries (advertising and media, entertainment and games, film industry, medicine, etc.), this technology can also be used by malevolent actors for criminal purposes, for information and psychological attacks on the population, and also for deliberately harming state-to-state relations. The risks of malicious use of deepfakes are as real as the benefits of using them. In a number of countries, deepfake technology is already seen as presenting a variety of challenges to national security and information and psychological security in the years to come.
   This article provides a general overview of the scale and spheres of deepfake usage, the prospects and already registered cases of the malicious use of deepfake technology in the political sphere, and also assesses the risks of malicious use of this technology for Japan and the risk perception by Tokyo.

AB This article describes the stakeholders and practices of political and economic interaction in Kemerovo region as a resource-abundant region. based on in-depth interviews and a formalized survey. The stakeholders include higher regional officials and top managers of resource-extraction companies. The study provides an insider's perspective on a regional case, as the researchers themselves are deeply embedded in the social and economic realities of the Kemerovo region. This fact means that they were engaged in solving the problem of theorizing the commonness that is specific sociology. The solution this problem involves the use of a research strategy of grounded theory, which implies the choice of models and tools that correspond to the characteristics of the research object.
   The chosen research methodology made it possible to describe the practices of quasi-public interaction that have in Kuzbass, which are characterized by the following features. Representatives of regional authorities and resource companies position themselves as subjects acting in the interests of the entire population of the region. At the same time, they monopolize the functions of formulating and realizing social development goals declaring that only they have the exclusive information and opportunities are necessary for this. Within the framework of this approach the population is practically excluded from the number of active subjects of political, economic and social interaction. Representatives of regional authorities and resource companies jointly implement both economic and political and administrative functions at the informal level. The incumbents involve entrepreneurs the implementation of political and administrative functions, including financing the production of public goods, various kinds of social and infrastructure projects, etc. Entrepreneurs agree to do these actions, because they realize that it is impossible to conduct any serious business without direct support from the authorities. All participants in political and economic interaction, i.e. political leaders, professional civil servants, owners and managers of resource companies behave not in accordance with their formal social roles, but as persons included in a closed vertical social network.

DT Article
DE Historical source; Chamber Fourrier journal; Russian Empire; Europe;
   international relations; Nicholas II; coronation in 1896; ceremonial
AB The article analyzes the Chamber Furrier journal of the voyage of Emperor Nicholas II across Europe in 1896. The voyage was made immediately after the coronation ceremony. It was undertaken with an aim of adjusting his notions on the foreign policy of the Russian Empire, and at the same time, in order to implement representative functions. It is the ceremonial side of foreign summits that this unique source reveals. It serves several functions at once: informational, utilitarian, and commemorative. The article sums up the features of this document, the nature of the notes and their content. The source permits to identify the emperor's route, his activities, time and place of contacts with various officials. The notes contain information on vestments of individuals, decoration of premises, usage of state symbols. There are notes of organizational and economic significance. Among the pages of the journal there are characteristic tabs: seating plans, performance programs, menus, and other documents in foreign languages testifying to political and cultural connections. On the basis of the register covering the visits to Austria-Hungary, Germany, France, a general "scenario" of summit meetings can be identified with their key stages and main tasks. Particular attention is paid to recording toasts that were pronounced at ceremonial dinners and were of declarative nature. In fact, they were an official communique of the entire meeting delivered in person. Such texts were fully reproduced on the pages of the Chamber-Fourrier journal in Russian. Other information on diplomatic negotiations was not reflected in the ceremonial journal. Memory of each visit was being written synchronously to its proceedings. Summit meetings were an integral part of the international cooperation. The 1896 voyage presented a new actor on the "European stage," attracting attention and thereby contributing to the resumption of discussions of general geopolitical situation. The experience of participating in official receptions, as presented in the Chamber-Fourrier journal, was taken into account when developing programs for return visits of the heads of foreign powers to the Russian Empire in subsequent years. On one hand, these notes reflect the "ceremonial side" of the events of national importance; on the other hand, they allow a better understanding of various organizational aspects.

The session summed up results of 5 years of research work of scientific team at the Institute of World History financed by the grant of the Russian Science Foundation 17-18-01728 in 2017-2021. The author specifies main publications and reviews in press on the published book series "The World System of Socialism" and global economics" established in the "Ves' Mir" publishing company as part of the project, and analyses its merit in comparison with analogous book series which appeared in the world. The key talking points of presented papers are represented threw the lense of a search for alternative development in 1950s - 1970s, alternative to the capitalist system. The comparative analysis of modernization efforts in the countries of the Eastern Bloc, institutional reforms in COMECON and UN (creation of UNCTAD), collective answer to technological challenges of the colour TV (SECAM) is displayed around discussion on the struggle between political and economic concerns of policymakers in this period of time. The author comes to conclusion that the trend line in the world historiography of the last 5 years becomes a study of the global Cold War from the angle of "East - South" relations. The interdisciplinary research conducted by Russian historians answers this new challenge in research field of the Cold War history.

DT Article
DE persuasion; hinges epistemology; conviction; dispute resolution
AB We offer a translation of the article by the American philosopher Robert Fogelin (1932-2016) "Logic of Deep Disagreements" and indicate three aspects of the relevance of the concept of deep disagreement proposed in it. It influenced the development of dialectical approaches in argumentation, which explore non-deductive arguments along with deductive ones, and contributed to the hinges epistemology by focusing on the ultimate foundations of knowledge, as well as on the role of moral realism in contemporary analytic philosophy. Fogelin's paper marks one of the first steps in the so-called hinges epistemology, a contemporary trend in analytical epistemology associated with the idea that there are the conceptual foundations of our views which provide a necessary foundation for acquiring of new knowledge and its discussions. Wittgenstein compares those foundations with door hinges that fasten the body of personal knowledge from the inside and outside and insists that doubts or disagreements about them collapse that body of knowledge and make its update impossible. Fogelin called them deep disagreements in which the parties may share many opinions, but still disagree on principal issues, for these are disagreements about their moral commitments, which rational agents voluntarily take on with the burden of proof when they engage themselves into a discussion, put forward and defend by means of arguments their opinions by contrasting them with the opinions and arguments of others. Their shared background views and preferences constitute the pillars of argumentation, which support the argumentation and the resolutions of differences of opinions. The absence of such pillars shows up under the surface of the parties' positions when the parties go deep into their foundations. The deep disagreement stops the argumentation or turns it into a verbal duel, and either results in no solution to the dispute, or makes it meaningfully unconvincing for its parties. According to Fogelin, it is impossible to resolve a deep disagreement by means of conviction; however, there might be a chance to overcome it by first isolating the dispute deadlock caused by it, and then by looking for acceptable arguments with the help of persuasion in order to grope a local compromise, albeit without objectifying it.

TI PROTEAN POWER CONCEPT IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: ORIGINS AND PROSPECTS

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Protean power; constructivism; uncertainty; international relations
AB In contrast to the representatives of other directions in International Relations Science, constructivists have long distanced themselves from the notion of power, but in the 2000s and 2010s, due to the increasing interest in conceptualizing this phenomenon, the first attempts of the constructivist interpretation of the concept of power started to emerge. Such interpretations received their fullest expression in the concept of Protean power, developed by a group of researchers under the informal leadership of Peter Katzenstein.
   The article analyzes the main features of the Protean power, as well as the emerging practices. The author shows that this type of power is less associated with specific actors and their intentions than other types of power, since it is aimed at overcoming uncertainty under the conditions when it is impossible to calculate risks. This formulation of the question allows one to reconsider the role of the creativity principle in international interactions and provide it with a higher ontological status.
   According to the author's conclusion, the concept of Protean power continues the line of revising the ontological foundations of the studies of world politics, which has emerged within constructivism in the last decade. Similarly to some other constructivist concepts, this concept implies a holistic interpretation of the phenomenon of power in international relations and reflects the desire to move away from the classical (Newtonian) worldview. Although today it provides many reasons for criticism and, perhaps, needs further elaboration and reinterpretation, its contribution to the scientific discussion of the ontology of power in international interactions is beyond doubt. Protean power is paving the way that allows bypassing the neo-positivist consensus that has so far set the tone in the International Relations Science.

AB The political developments on the Korean Peninsula, which is situated, in fact, at the heart of North-East Asia, will largely determine the strategic situation in the Asia-Pacific region and globally. The monograph by Anatoly Torkunov, Georgy Toloraya and Ilya Diachkov "Modern Korea: The Metamorphosis of turbulent years" is aimed at the consideration of the situation on and around the Peninsula from 2008 to the present. The monograph explores several major interconnected subjects: the domestic processes in South and North Koreas, the North-South relations, the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula and attempts to tackle the problem, the prospects for the formation of a multilateral security architecture in Northeast Asia, as well as Russia's policy on the Peninsula and Russia's relations with each of the two Korean states. Although some of the authors' conclusions can be argued, the book, on the one hand, distinguishes a sober and realistic analysis of the processes on the Korean Peninsula, and, on the other hand, a sense of geopolitical empathy, allowing a better understanding of the motives that pushed North Korea on the nuclear and missile path. The authors of the monograph propose a visionary 'North Pacific Project' - an institution of cooperation of key actors in Northeast Asia and the North Pacific, in which it would be possible to interact not only on nuclear strategic issues, but also on a wide range of problems.

DT Article
DE political regime; communism; socialism; China; right-wing communism;

AB The article analyzes the nature of the political system of modern China in the context of the typology of communist political regimes. The author argues that the typologies of communist regimes proposed so far are of little use, since the differences between the regimes were not considered deeply enough, while the ideology factor was not actually used as a criterion for typological differences. The article proposes a new typology of communist regimes, in which the ideological factor is the key criterion. Based on the analysis of various communist regimes in accordance with the ideological criterion, the author identifies three main types of communist regimes: left-communist, right-communist and bureaucratic, and defines the current Chinese regime as evolving from right-communist to bureaucratic. The author concludes that the Chinese political experiment deserves close study and a departure from the Westcentric cliches that still dominate world political science and historical science, and the new typology of communist regimes can serve as a useful tool both for its analysis and for clarifying the prospects for China's development.

AB The article is devoted to one of the most common, and currently almost disappeared custom of blood feud. The authors aim to characterize the adats and rituals associated with blood feuds among the peoples of mountainous Dagestan in the 19th - early 20th century. The research is based on historical-comparative, historical-typological methods and the principle of historical-cultural reconstruction. The chronological framework of the study covers the 19th - early 20th century. This is the period of legal pluralism in Dagestan, when the norms of customary law (adats), Sharia and the laws of the Russian Empire were in force in the mountains.The reasons for the occurrence of blood feuds, adats regulating the legal consequences of murder, as well as the rites of reconciliation of blood relatives are identified and investigated. It is established that in Dagestan, due to the specific features of the socio-economic and political system, such types of criminal punishment as deprivation of liberty, execution, corporal and degrading measures of influence did not arise for the murder of a person. The results of the study can be used by employees of education and culture to familiarize the younger generation with the legal experience of their ancestors.

AB Introduction. The paper deals with one of the aspects of the economic policy of the Russian Empire in its Peri-Caspian provinces, annexed as a result of the Persian campaign of Peter the Great. The aim of the study is to analyze the main income items of the imperial treasury based on the materials of the Derbent garrison of the Lower Corps, to establish the share of income received in Derbent in the structure of all income of the Lower Corps. Tasks: to characterize all income sources of the Derbent garrison, to show the activities of commandants and other military leaders in streamlining the income structure, in replenishing the imperial treasury, to consider the interaction of the Russian authorities of Derbent with foreign merchants and domestic salesmen, to describe the daily life of the garrison in Derbent. Methods and materials. The study is based on the archival documents from the Central State Archive of the Republic of Dagestan, mainly from fond 18 "Derbent commandant", most of which are introduced for the first time. Additionally, the modern achievements of historical science on the subject have also been considered. The methods of the study are the following: the principles of historicism and objectivity, an integrated approach, a systematic method, methods of criticizing historical sources. Based on the analysis of the documentary material, it was possible to restore the picture characterizing the everyday life of the military personnel in the Derbent garrison of the imperial army. Analysis. The fiscal activity inside the Derbend garrison was controlled by the commandant, whose duties, in addition to military-political ones, included collecting taxes and fees, reporting on them to the central imperial authorities and administration. The amount of incomes for the reporting periods are described in detail, the role of Derbent customs in replenishing the Russian treasury and the trade of the Derbent administration with foreign merchants are shown. Considerable emphasis is put to the activities of the military leadership of the Lower Corps and the Derbent Garrison, directly aimed at increasing financial revenues of the imperial treasury. Results. As a result of the study, valuable archival documents were introduced into the scientific circulation, reconstructing the daily life of the Derbent garrison, the main sources of income in this garrison were identified. It was established that the revenues of the imperial treasury in the Derbent garrison were clearly differentiated and structured. Customs duties accounted for more than half of the revenue in Derbent, while the other part was collected from the sale of wine, vegetables, oil, and court fines. The "Persian" incomes were spent on salaries and remuneration to the Caucasian political elite loyal to the Russians, to keep the amanates (hostages) from Caucasian rulers, to pay wages to masters for the repair and reconstruction of fortresses, to maintain postal communications, etc. Despite the emperor's ambitious plans for the economic development of the "newly conquered" former Persian provinces, many of the projects he started were not completed and scraped after his death. A pressing example of it would be the abandonment of the construction of the Derbent port enclosed from sea storms.

DE women's protest; protest dynamics; political mobilization; women's

AB Introduction. The article presents the analysis of the contemporary state and prospects for the development of women's protest in a global perspective. The research focuses on the study of the causes and nature of mass women's protest in the context of the formation of a new system of relations between the authorities and society represented by certain social groups. The relevance of the problem is determined by the need for a political science analysis of modern practices, causes and forms of women's protest, making a forecast of the prospects for the development of women's social movements. Methods and methodology. The methodological basis of the research is the synthesis of the relative deprivation theory by T.R. Gurr and the resource mobilization theory by Ch. Tilly, which makes it possible to present women's protest through the prism of both psychological (deprivation) and institutional determinants. The empirical basis of the work is the data (338 cases) of the quantitative study "The Women in Resistance (WiRe)", that is available for secondary analysis in the Harvard Dataverse Repository. Analysis. Women's protests represent an institutional and non-institutional form of changing the "political field". A common peripheral role of women in the political space serves as a basis for the formation of a common identity among them. A high degree of consolidation, as well as an active role of women in protest, correlates with the success of collective action. Protests in which women play an active role are more peaceful in nature. This is due to the mediating role of women, which prevents the growth of tension in the conflict. Results. Based on the analysis of statistical information and case-study, it was revealed that the economic and legal structural similarity of states does not determine the nature of women's protest participation in politics, which is more dependent on historical practices, previously achieved results of women's protest, the presence of institutional structures that organize protests, as well as on the specific problems of women in the state. The prospects for the development of women's protest and women's social movements are determined by the level of success achieved. While in Western Europe and the USA, women's social movements are fighting for the achievement of post-material values, due to the solution of the economic differentiation problems, in Latin America, women are fighting for their natural right to life and their own bodies. A vector of women's protest is aimed at combating all types of Ex', discrimination, but the nature of specific problems is fundamentally different.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Soviet bureaucracy; heritage of L.D. Trotsky; theoretical content;
   logical structure and political consequences of the concept of Trotsky's
   bureaucracy
AB The article identifies and analyzes the essential provisions of Trotsky's concept regarding the Soviet bureaucracy. Its nature is determined by the connection with the genesis of Stalin's regime of personal power. The intellectual and philosophical tendencies of bureaucracy are a complex of procedures of thought and action, on which the regime of personal power is based as a modification of the enlightened monarchy, the Orthodox Church and the police state. Theories arising in these religious-political forms justify bureaucratic thinking. The history of European and Russian social thought can be studied as a process of selecting those theories that refute bureaucratic thought and practice and counteract the concentration of power in one hand. A historiographic concept is needed for which the value of the state and bureaucracy is not the main one.
   According to the paper, Trotsky's views on the Soviet bureaucracy form an important link in the theory and practice of political resistance to the regime of personal power. The history of the USSR is the history of the struggle of the Soviet bureaucracy for its share in revenues and in power. The Stalinist ways of understanding the theory of Marx and the practice of Lenin are false and lead to the bureaucratization of the party and state. There is a similarity between the political practice of Stalin, the activities of the Orthodox Church, the police state, Italian fascism and German Nazism. Any theoretical works commissioned by the pinnacle of the bureaucracy contain the danger of reproducing all the features of the Stalinist way of thinking and acting.

SO POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Christian liberalism; Orthodoxy in Russia; Christian democracy;
   Christian politics
AB Russia, in contrast to other modern Orthodox European countries, has never experienced struggle for church autocephaly and the formation of political pluralism simultaneously, which naturally brought the church and liberals closer together. The distinguishing feature of the Russian liberalism is its late, or "catch up", development. In the 19th century, liberalism no longer needed a religious approval; the appeal to the Holy Scriptures looked archaic. Another Russian distinguishing feature - divergence of secular and spiritual traditions - is also very important. After the emergence of the dualistic monarchy in Russia (1906-1917), religious topics were no longer a taboo, but Christian liberalism as an influential trend failed to develop. The attempts of combining liberal and Christian ideas in the pre-revolutionary Russian politics faced a number of problems. The results in practice were modest either due to the lack of the electoral demand, or due to the blocking of specific initiatives at the state and church levels. The promotion of liberal values contradicted Orthodox tenets, and the target electoral group - the lower clergy - heavily depended on the episcopate. In the post-Soviet Russia, in contrast to the countries in Central Europe, Christian politics, including its liberal version, did not revive. At the end of the day, all such projects have remained marginal. The episcopate focuses on cooperation with the authorities, and there is little support for liberal ideas among the faithful. The future might see a gradual strengthening of liberal tendencies within the church, but at the same time, the Russian version of Christian democracy remains extremely unlikely.

AB Based on the analysis of various historical sources, the article examines the emotional regime that was formed in the new industrial center during the period of forced industrialization. At present, the history of emotions as a scientific trend is becoming extremely popular in the world historical science, however, research is mainly based on extensive material in the "emotional aspect" from the point of view of chronology and territorial framework. The author offers a specific example of the emotional community study on local material and believes that the thoughts and feelings of the townspeople sought to unify within the framework of a "new city" development concept and imposed a certain set of normative emotions and official practices on the Magnitogorsk people, as well as the emotives expressing them, which acted as a support for the existing political regime.

ID MULTICULTURALISM
AB The paper focuses on the dynamics of political and public discourse in liberal democracies about cultural heterogeneity and about how these dynamics are reflected in academic discourse. During the last third of the twentieth century, the imperative to make each national culture homogeneous lost its appeal and was replaced by a fascination with ideas of a "multicultural society" However, the beginning of this century has been marked by disillusionment with these ideas and widespread nostalgia for a time when cultural homogeneity remained an unquestioned good. The author argues that the current explanations for this discursive shift are insufficient. He maintains instead that this shift has been brought on mostly by the dominance of neoliberalism as the regime of government. The result was that ordinary citizens began to associate the rhetoric of support for cultural differences with the insensitivity of the ruling elites to the problem of social inequality. Right-wing populists are eagerly exploiting the discontent of a broad public with "liberal elites." In its attempt to adapt to these changed conditions, the establishment is seeking new forms of public rhetoric -using terms ranging from "muscular liberalism" and "civic integration" to "interculturalism." Both official and academic discourse had taken a "diversity turn" by 2010. Today the category of diversity serves the same functions as multiculturalism in the 198os and 1990s, providing both the basic trope of public rhetoric and a theoretical framework. The author finds analytical potential in that framework but calls attention to its problematic nature, which involves, among other things, valorizing difference while downgrading equality.

AB The article discusses the real historical conditions and ideological prerequisites for the emergence of a special genre in Marxist sociology - "criticism of bourgeois sociology". The leader of the Bolshevik party and the founder of the Soviet state, V.I. Lenin, gave this criticism state-political significance, put forward its program, outlined its focus and set a pattern. Using concrete examples, he showed that the "principle of party affiliation" in philosophy is applicable as a universal methodology for suspecting and exposing ideological opponents. The causes are identified and the consequences of substituting doctrinal criticism with ideological unmasking initiated by V.I. Lenin are analyzed. The positive sociocultural functions of doctrinal criticism in essence are considered.

TI AMENDING THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION AS SYMBOLIC POLITICS: 1993-2020

DT Article
DE symbolic politics; constitutional process; political crisis of 1993 in
   Russia; political and ideological spectrum; conservative turn;
   constitutional reform of 2020 in Russia; the Constitution of Russian
   Federation
AB Constitutions are not simply political and legal documents; they are also complex political symbols that convey a manifold content and invite various interpretations. This article provides a review of the approaches to political symbolical analysis of constitutions. After this more general view, the author focuses on the symbolic competition of interpretations and explores the discussions about amending the Russian Constitution that took place from 1993 to 2020. The research is based on publications by official websites and media. The author demonstrates that the political crisis of 1993, which resulted in adoption of "Yeltsin's" Constitution, played a formative role in shaping the identities of political forces that consolidated in the 1990s. The groups occupying different positions in the political spectrum included different meanings in the Constitution. They considered amendments not just as a tool for changing rules, but also as a vehicle for their desired values. Comparing the amendments adopted in 2020 reveals their connections with the previous symbolic struggle. In 2020, soon after deciding to adopt significant but "dotty" amendments to the Constitution which made it possible to "null" Vladimir Putin's previous presidential terms, the Russian ruling elite opted for adding some value principles as were proposed before. Analysing the symbolism of the process behind crafting these amendments reveals their populist nature. The president was the true chief arbiter behind the proposals supposedly "from below" that were presented by a special working group. The legitimization of the amendments was delegated to the people who should vote for the total package. The elite groups, who had struggled to add amendments for years, were largely deprived of any opportunity to influence decisions. The new amendments did not cancel those parts of the "unchangeable" chapters that drew major criticism from both the Communists and the Conservators. The most disputable amendments were formulated rather ambiguously. Thus, overall, neither segment of critics of the Constitution turned to be really satisfied by the amendments.

AB The main focus of the article was on the impact of current historical policy affecting the foreign and domestic political interests of the Russian Federation (mainly in the fields of interethnic relations and international law) on the educational strategies of the authorities, designed to facilitate or impede the process of forming a Russian civil identity. Specific historical and contemporary examples show that the latter has long been considered as a humanitarian technology for solving state problems in this field, within the contemporary informational space with a cumulative effect in terms of the space of politically engaged versions of different pages of history, especially closely related to the formation of the contemporary world order. Accordingly, the focus of the study is the contradictions between the historical and educational policies of the Russian Federation, which are analyzed through the lens of the evolution of the aims of the authorities in matters of the historical education and historical memory, their norm-legal regulation and institutional support, as well as real educational practices after 1991. The experience of the several years (since 2014) on the introduction of the historical and cultural standard for teaching the school course of the history is considered as a collective attempt by the authorities and society to lead historical and educational policies to a common denominator in terms of the content and value. The special accent in the article concerns the problems of the teacher professional training for the implementation of the state historical and educational policy of the Russian Federation within given framework, considering the specifics of the contemporary informational space. Both methodological and organizational restrictions were identified in secondary and higher schools (primarily at specialized faculties of pedagogical universities), which have a significant impact on the formation of civil identity through historical education, both at the stage of training pedagogical personnel and in the process of studying the school course of the history.

DE Iraq; Shiites; the political elite recruiting; muhassasa;

AB The features of recruiting the political elite of Iraq after the overthrow of the regime of President Saddam Hussein in 2003 are considered. The relevance of the study is due to the need to study the processes of elite formation in the Middle East during the period of regional transformations. The key mechanisms and principles of the formation of the Iraqi political elite within the framework of the emerging post-Saddam political system have been identified. It is shown that the political leaders who came into power with the support of the Americans until 2003 were the "counter-elite" of S. Hussein, therefore participation in the opposition movements became an important criterion for recruiting. Special attention is paid to the informal (traditional) principles of recruiting the new elite, which have become the main mechanism of this process. In particular, the following principles are described: "muhassasa taifiyya", which assumes the distribution of political positions in accordance with the share of ethno-confessional groups in the general population, clan solidarity, and religious institutions. It is emphasized that the role of Shiite religious structures, including spiritual leaders, and their influence on the formation of the political elite have significantly increased compared to the pre-occupation period.

AB Introduction. One of the key tendencies of modern international development is the growing importance of the "factor of power". In this context, the initiated long process of the potential growth of the armed forces of the countries participating in NATO, which is of particular importance in the growth of new unconventional threats (one of the triggers of the Alliance transformation including through the strengthening of national units has become a global pandemic) is important from scientific and practical points of view. Methods and materials. The theoretical and methodological basis of the research is the theory of building armed forces. The basic sources for the analysis are official documents of military departments, as well as materials from related information centers, which reveal the parameters of the prospective appearance of the armed forces of the countries under study. NATO's statistical and summit reports also occupy a special place. Analysis. The goal of the article is the research of the armed forces building processes in Germany and Norway for the future until the mid-2030s. These case countries can show the tendencies of military development of NATO European member states in the whole taking into account the differences between Germany and Norway in terms of the geographical location, the population as the main human resource of the armed forces, as well as the transformation of leadership and dynamics of relations between the "historical West" and the Russian Federation, which allows us to characterize the overall trends in the military and political development of European NATO member states. Results. It is proved that the growth of military potential is based on two main groups of reasons. The first is due to the strategic deterioration of relations between the West and Russia since the mid-2010s. The second is that the armed forces of the European member States of NATO have reached the 'bottom" position in terms of almost all quantitative parameters. The continuing trend of decreasing numerical indicators (people and technology) threatens to reduce the role of the state on the world stage. Therefore, it is natural to see Germany's desire to become a "framework nation" in the recruitment of NATO rotation groups in Europe, as well as in the deployment of peacebuilding and peacekeeping missions outside the area of responsibility of the Alliance, which inevitably leads to a large-scale increase in the number of armed forces and the cost of their modernization. In the case of Norway the transformation of the armed forces occurs in the conditions of refusal to increase included human resources and enhance the value of the military presence of NATO partners (primarily the US) first of all in the process of reorganizing the national system of territorial defense. In both cases, there are still tendencies to transform the role of the US in Europe and to consolidate the confrontation with the Russian Federation.

AB The article examines the problem of "path dependence" on Russia's existing institutional structure and the possibility of socio-economic modernization. The urgency of the specified problem lies in the fact of political elite's (directly or indirectly interested in the existing distribution of national income from the sale of energy resources) unwillingness to abandon the rental economy make any significant social transformations unlikely. Existing close relationships of political and economic institutions in modern Russia has led to their mutual stagnation and made it impossible for bifurcation points to emerge due to the entire system's inertia. The study's aim is to solve the problem of political and economic institutions' stagnation, socio-political and socio-economic modernization by analyzing key elements of "path dependence" in Russia, as well as institutional mechanisms of bifurcation points' emergence as one of the institutional development factors. The paper analyzes the consequences of mobilization development as one of the types of modernization that have been used in Russian history for the current structure of economic and political institutions. The article examines key factors of rent-oriented behavior and autocratic authority as patterns of "path dependence" in Russia's institutional structure, which also negatively affect the possibility of modernization. Based on the analysis, several options for carrying out socio-economic modernization (displaying the most successful cases in foreign countries) in Russia are proposed.

DE Soviet science; scientific community; academic science; university
   science; departmental science
AB The concept of Soviet science was formed in many ways spontaneously. Initially, under the conditions of the Civil War, science was viewed by the Bolsheviks as a tool and a way to achieve political and military goals. But, as with other objects of social design - socialist economy. culture, education, etc. - they did not have clear ideas about socialist science. Only the opinion about the class character of bourgeois science and its role, subordinate to the interests of capital and the monarchy, was stable. Taking this factor into account, the attitude of the new government to various scientific areas was formed. The Bolsheviks had more confidence in the natural and technical sciences, the achievements of which were supposed to be "taken as they are passed on to us by the bourgeois heritage". The social sciences and humanities were judged sharply critically as, on the whole. hostile to the socialist idea.
   The Soviet model of science finally took shape in the 1930s. It was distinguished by some specific features that largely determined its achievements and failures. These include a hierarchical, open-ended organisational structure that includes 3 sectors of science (departmental, academic and university). In addition, it is necessary to note such features of Soviet science as decentralisation, complete dependence on the state and the planning system.
   The tactics of state support for strategically important areas of science and the lack of alternative mechanisms for financing scientific research contributed to the rapid bureaucratisation of Soviet science, deformation of the structure of scientific knowledge (imbalance between the exact, natural, technical, social sciences and the humanities in terms of the pace and level of development) and the priority of applied research over fundamental. And one more feature is the strict ideological control of scientific knowledge, supplemented by repressions against "bourgeois" science and its representatives, as well as the prohibition (explicit and implicit) on direct contacts, which led to the isolation and low level of mobility of the scientific community.

TI CLIENTELISM AND INFORMAL NETWORKS OF REGIONAL ELITES IN RUSSIA: NETWORK

LA Russian
DT Article
DE informal networks; patron-client relationships; clientelism; patronage
   bureaucracy; political regime; network analysis; regional elites; SNA
AB Studying informal aspects of politics in Russia and post-Soviet states more broadly has become an influential research trend. The concepts of clientelism and informal networks often serve as a theoretical framework for such an analysis. Despite obvious connotations, students of informal networks only rarely take advantage of methodological tools provided by Social Network Analysis (SNA). They not only allow scholars to visualize a network and to calculate its basic statistic characteristics, but also puts forth more rigorous requirements for the operationalization of the informal network, thereby making it a logically conceptualized category and not just a metaphor, as it is often presented in the literature. By using SNA tools, the presented paper studies informal networks of administrative elites of the Sverdlovsk Oblast. Having experienced a relatively rapid economy recovery following the collapse of the USSR, the region's success in bargaining with federal elites over the advancement of its legal status in the 1990s and long-term into the office of its first governor brought forth explanations that emphasize the power of elite networks in this region. This article aims to test these assumptions quantitatively. To that end, we analyzed informal networks of the heads of the executive agencies and provided three temporal snapshots. These correspond to the terms of the two governors that held the office: Eduard Rossel and Alexandr Misharin. The informal networks were based on biographical data, which we collected and recorded into the database. This database consists of 665 rows, which contain information on the career paths of 78 officials. After identifying the intersections of the career paths of these individuals prior to them occupying elite positions, we built networks based on them. We have analyzed the structures of these networks, their density, the presence of communities, and centrality measures, which allowed us to see how different the patterns of the networks can be depending on the strategies of their leaders.

AB The article is focused on ideas, expressed in a new book the complex political and economic processes taking place in the Republic of Belarus require "a game of scaling". Whether counting the participants of protest rallies, or analyzing statements of the authorities and the opposition, or assessing inventory and exchange rate dynamics, Specialists aspire to provide a reliability of the analysis of current processes. However, the strategic analysis and a forecast within the framework of this approach is impossible. The border situation of Belarus cannot be considered exhaustively studied. The borderline changes its quality. Located between socialist Poland and the Soviet republics, Belarus did not move geographically, but the political and geographical changes were fundamental. Belarus found itself in the center of a mosaic space, the key characteristic of which is being located on the frontier. The question is where a new frontier of civilizations will be fixed. near Brest or near Smolensk? The author of the book as well as the author of this article are confident that the informal civilizational border is located near Brest and Grodno.

AB "Voprosy filosofii" publishes one of the last interviews of the Dean of the faculty of philosophy of Lomonosov Moscow State University, associate member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, DSc in Philosophy V.V. Mironov, which he gave to his student, lecturer of The Ilya Glazunov Russian Academy of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture N.A. Shchipkov. The conversation focuses on the post-Soviet ideological reform of the faculty of philosophy and the creation of a new social science - cultural studies - the emergence of which has affected the methodological landscape of Russian Humanities. Thirty years ago, thanks to the initiative of the rector of Moscow State University V.A. Sadovnichy, organizational efforts of A.V. Panin, V.V. Mironov, V.Y. Savrei and other political and cultural figures such as R.M. Gorbacheva and D.S. Likhachev, the department of History and Theory of World culture appeared at the faculty of philosophy of Moscow University. Its field of study has always been extremely close to Vladimir Vasilyevich's own scientific interests and it is no accident that he considered "Philosophy and metamorphoses of culture" to be one of his most important works; a work devoted not only to the problem of culture itself, but also to the place of the Humanities in modern philosophical studies and education.

AB In the article, I try to refute an old and widespread superstition according to which the new political philosophy created by Niccolo Machiavelli breaks with classical political philosophy by taking a novel position toward the political; that is, that classics were idle "idealists" while Machiavelli is a cold-blooded "realist". To do that, I compare the most explicit part of The Prince (chapters XIV-XIX) with the end of the fifth book of Aristotle's Politics and attempt to show that in the most pivotal chapters of his most famous work, the Florentine, in fact, often borrows Aristotle's advice on how to preserve a tyrannical rule.

Managed the order Budon's research includes an analysis of the institutions of the police and gendarmerie, their social composition, number, methods of combating crime and popular protest, desertion, and political conspiracies. Particular attention is paid to the role of Napoleon himself and his ministers in the process of creating the "New Order". Boudon comes to the conclusion that in his policy the emperor continued to implement what had been planned back in the era of the Directory, and the social problems themselves, generated by the situation in the 1790s, which the authorities had to deal with, changed quantitatively, not qualitatively. The effectiveness of law enforcement agencies was also different in different regions (in the territory of the French departments and in the new territories annexed).

AB Objective: To study the monuments of diplomatic correspondence from the sixteenth century as a source of political thought in the successor states of the Golden Horde.
   Research materials: The messages of Crimean khans, sultans, representatives of ruling groups, Nogai beks and mirzas preserved in translated copies in the ambassadorial books of the Muscovite state.
   Novelty of the research: For the first time ever, the diplomatic documents of the Crimean khanate and the Nogai Horde are involved in the reconstruction of their period's corpus of political ideas. Considering the question of the authorship of messages, we proceed with the concept of S.M. Kashtanov about "technical authorship", in which the authorship is understood as the collective work of rulers, courtiers, bureaucrats, and technical workers on the creation of a letter.
   Research results: The application of the concept of "corporate authorship" has made it possible to show that diplomatic messages were always a product of some convention possible within the elite that were involved in the development of foreign policy. Translators played an important role in shaping the political language. The messages of the khans, sultans, beks, and mirzas of the successor states of the Golden Horde contain some ideas that can help us to outline the political ideology. Central to it is the thesis of the exclusive right to power of the Chinggisids who could get power only with the general consent of the "political people". "Evil" and "good" were the most important concepts of thought in the successor states. "Evil" was understood as any change in the established order, and "good" as its preservation. Thus, conservatism and the desire to fix the rituals of power and management practices that had developed earlier in the era of the Golden Horde were the most important concepts for political life in the successor states. This attitude led to the preservation of earlier concepts and terminological language, something which was reflected in the practice of diplomacy when the elusive reality of former power influenced ambassadorial ceremony and the form of messages.

AB Introduction. The article is a survey study, the purpose of which is to analyze the evolution of concepts in the field of political communicativistics, aimed at understanding the role of information in the system of political processes from the middle of the 20th Century to the present day. Methods and materials. As the main toolkit for working with scientific texts, methods of qualitative text analysis, focused on the study of the conceptual description of social problems, aspects of the interaction between government and society were used. As materials for the analysis, the texts of Russian and foreign scientists devoted to the study of the role of information in public administration and in political processes and published in one of the leading scientific periodicals or central scientific publishing houses were used. Analysis. The article establishes the objective factors of enhancing scientific research in the subject area of political communicativistics in the 20th Century, examines the modern understanding of the role of information in the processes of public administration, the influence of the general information theory and the cybernetic approach on the development of Russian political communication. Result. Modern political science concepts do not demonstrate a unified understanding of the "information future" image that emerges under the influence of the "digital revolution". The range of approaches is wide, from the libertarian assumption of a gradual weakening of the state functions and the transition to direct democracy, when citizens are in direct contact with each other using the technologies of the information and communication system of Internet and do not need the mediation of professional state administrators, to the revival of totalitarian forms of government based on control over information flows. The tendency of Russian scientists to correlate with the trends of state policy, shifting their research topics to the political aspects of information security, social networks and the activity of opposition public associations on the Internet, was revealed as the dominant trend at the current stage. This trend is ambiguous - it corresponds to the nature of modern challenges and threats in the information sphere, but in the future it can negatively affect the volume and quality of fundamental theoretical developments, and decrease the interest in them.

AB Introduction. The article presents the results of a study of communication in the system of local self-government of the Republic of Tatarstan as a subject of the Russian Federation conducted by the authors in November - December 2019. The study included a survey of representatives of regional media and press services of local authorities of the Republic of Tatarstan in order to determine the model of communication in the local government system and the role of PR-activities in the regulation of social interaction in the region. Methods and materials. The main method of studying was the method of expert survey. The authors developed a questionnaire, which was used during an interview with experts. When choosing an expert - a media representative for the interview - the authors took into account three factors: the rating of the represented media, the experience of the respondent in the regional media (at least five years) and the authority to make a key decision on the publication of the material. In order to identify the experts who are representatives of local self-government bodies, the authors of the article determined the following criteria: implementation of information and analytical activities in the structure of local self-government bodies, at least 5 years of experience as a head of a structural unit (public relations / media relations department) of local self-government bodies. Analysis. The analysis showed that the development of social media accelerates the process of establishing a two-way model of communication between the government and the public. Social media have become a full-fledged source of information both for the journalistic community and for the press services of local governments. Moreover, with the help of the content posted in posts on official accounts on social networks, local governments can attract residents of the municipal territory to participate in solving local issues. Constant monitoring, responding to comments, tracking negative content on social media are becoming everyday practices in the work of press services. Results. The results of the study indicate that over the past decade in the Russian Federation the necessary prerequisites have been formed for the formation of a bilateral symmetrical model of communication between local authorities and the population. This model is aimed at providing effective feedback that allows the local government to quickly respond to the aspirations and needs of the population, monitor their dynamics, constantly monitor the attitude and assessments of citizens of decisions made on the development of the city or region.

AB The article is grounded on the research based on a large set of documents stored in the central and regional archives of the Russian Federation and neighboring countries. The authors have formulated a research question concerning identification of the common features in the process of restoration of the Soviet power on the outskirts of the country during the last stage of the Civil War. The article draws on the material spanning a short period between the retreat of the whites (in the territory of Arkhangelsk province, the Don and Tersk regions, Kuban, Dagestan) and liquidation of governing bodies of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and entrance of the Red Army units. If before January-February 1920, the "whites" retreated with battles, then a preventive retreat ensued, and a regime of interstate power was established in the territory they left behind. The article reveals two scenarios on the eve of the reunification of the peripheral territories with the central Bolshevik power. It was quite rare that the area was abandoned without power and order. Usually, the consolidated democratic society either intercepted power from the weakened hands of the white administration or took over the reins of power from the command of the withdrawing White army in an organized manner. Temporary transitional authorities usually included representatives of socialist parties, non-partisan public, and trade unions. But in practice, this process had a distinct regional specificity influenced by the local palette of political forces, in the configuration that had developed before the Civil War. This phenomenon was very poorly reflected in the synchronous historical sources, so along with such miraculously preserved separate documents, personal evidence collected during the early Soviet memorial campaigns formed the basis for the study.

AB Recently, the socio-political aspect of Novosibirsk Academgorodok history in the 1960s has attracted more and more interest. On the one hand, this period is interesting as a stage in the formation of a new science center, on the other hand, as a stage of the greatest public activity, the study of which is the key to comprehending the phenomenon of the sixties as a whole. One particular feature of Akademgorodok was its democratic social environment, partly explained by the high level of its resident's education and the patronage of the Siberian Branch administration, which tried to maintain the image of the "City of the Sun" to attract the best scientific minds of the Soviet Union. The dominant role in the life of the scientific center belonged to the scientific intelligentsia, which considered itself a special caste and was in the position of scientism and belief in the possibility of building socialism "with a human face." This factor determined the peculiarity of the activities of the Komsomol organization of Akademgorodok. The goal of the study is to identify the main ideological and philosophical trends and ways of their implementation in the work of the Komsomol organization of Akademgorodok. In addition to archive data, the article uses materials from oral history. Interviews were recorded with some of the participants in those events. Khrushchev's "thaw" led to philosophical shifts in the mentality of the youth of Akademgorodok, most noticeable in the mid-1960s. This led to public discussions and demands for specific reforms of the Komsomol. In 1964-1965, Komsomol meetings were held in many institutes of the scientific center, discussing important question, - "Why do we need the Komsomol?" In some organizations, this wording meant the search for new forms of work, in others, this issue led to the decision to dissolve the Komsomol. The youth of Akademgorodok suggested giving more independence to the Komsomol, relieving it of the control and patronage of the Communist Party. The demand for greater democratization of the Komsomol and the revision of a number of provisions of its charter led to the political crisis in December 1965, marked by the confrontation between the Komsomol activists of Akademgorodok and regional and city party bodies. The party leadership responded with repressive measures: the Komsomol committee of the Siberian branch, which united scientific youth, was dissolved. Anatoly Slutsky, the first secretary of the city Komsomol committee and an ardent supporter of the Komsomol activists of Akademgorodok, was removed from his position. Despite that, representatives of the young scientific intelligentsia were able to maintain their main positions in the leadership of the Komsomol of the Soviet district. As a result, many new forms of work and economic activism have been implemented. The scientific association "Fakel" was created at the initiative of the youth of Akademgorodok, which allowed the Komsomol to obtain huge financial resources to support its clubs.

AB This article focuses on the semiotic mechanisms of social meaning formation. In contemporary sociolinguistics, the concept of indexicality has been a central means of studying the relationships between language forms and social meanings. The semiotic mechanisms are based on the process of indexicality, through which language forms acquire indexical meanings. The methodological sources are the theories of: language ideology (S. Gal, J. Irvine), indexing gender (E. Ochs), "orders of indexicality" (M. Silverstein), and also the concepts "enregisterment" (A. Agha), "indexical field" (P. Eckert), "stance" (A. Jaffe). I argue that, taken together, these approaches constitute a framework for understanding the problem of social meaning in language in a systematic way. The article analyses indexicality with the help of the iconic relation, which creates the ideological focus of the problem. In addition, the dynamics of transition of indexical orders are shown: from historical differentiation, stylistic shift to stereotyping. The limits of the application of indexicality theory to the analysis of social meaning are revealed. At the same time the significance of contextual- performative approach to the study of social meanings, which uses the concept "indirect indexality", is substantiated. This approach is based on constitutive relations between language and social categories, in which language forms are capable of indexing social meanings, which, in their turn, constitute meanings of social categories.

AB Transformational processes in the world are accelerating and are highly intertwined. Deep rifts are taking place in the geopolitical space. The most acute contradictions and multidirectional tendencies of world development accumulated in the previous period develop. New points of reference have emerged in assessing the close relationship and interdependence of macroeconomic and military-political processes, which shape unknown fields of world politics. Confrontation between the key centers of power, capable of creating various geopolitical configurations, where expanded opportunities for promoting their national and state interests appear. The period of intelligible, more or less ordered competitive interactions in the world seems to be coming to an end. In Western-centric geopolitical associations, the not always expected and predictable regrouping of forces and interests is taking place more frequently, fraught with serious strategic consequences. Recently in the development of the transatlantic partnership, the contradictions, problem nodes and pain points that have complicated the allied ties between the United States and the European Union have been contrasted. Disagreements in the US-EU-NATO geopolitical triangle have noticeably increased. A sign of these disagreements was the diagnosis of "NATO brain death", which E. Macron made to the North Atlantic alliance in December 2019. New geopolitical discrepancies have emerged in EU relations with key strategic partners.

ID LOGIC
AB The sentences 'p but I don't believe p' (omissive form) and 'p but I believe that not-p' (comissive form) are typical examples of Moore's paradox. When an agent (sincerely) asserts such sentences under normal circumstances, we consider his statements absurd. The Simple Solution (Moore, Heal, Wolgast, Kriegel, et al.) finds the source of absurdity for such statements in a certain formal contradiction (some kind of like 'p & not-p'), the presence of which is lexically disguised. This solution is facing criticism since it is obvious that the denial of the contradiction allegedly hidden in Moore's paradox will not become an expression of tautology for us. Hintikka offers another solution to Moore's paradox. In his view, the source of absurdity is the practical inconceivability of the situation, in which the agent would be able to hold mutually incompatible (inconsistent) beliefs. The sentences 'p but I don't believe that p' and 'p but I believe that not-p' sound absurd because they express high-ordered beliefs that no rational agent can hold. A belief expressed in the sentence 'he believes that p', in order to be available to the agent, must be compatible with the truth of everything the agent believes. The problem with Hintikka's solution is that it relies on an epistemic principle that does not correspond to our general intuitions about the notion of belief. According to this principle, there must be a close connection between the sentence 'p but I don't believe that p' and the sentence 'I believe that is the case is that p but I don't believe that p'. However, it is not difficult to imagine the context for situations when the agent asserts the sentence 'p but I don't believe that p' when s/he believes that p, but in parallel does not hold any high-ordered belief about his/her belief in p. For example, the agent does not recognize oneself in a photograph after a hard plastic surgery, and when one asks him 'who is this?' it would not be absurd for him/her to accept the following description of his/her beliefs 'I believe that {I am me} but I don't believe that I believe that {I am me}'. Wittgenstein provides an alternative solution based on a descriptive analysis of the grammar of verbs we use to express, attribute, and understand each other's psychological states. In his view, the everyday practice of using the verb 'believe' demonstrates a characteristic asymmetry in the semantic and logical properties of the usage of this verb in the first person. The expression 'I believe falsely' has no real meaning since no one can meaningfully say the sentence 'Now I believe falsely that p' on their own behalf. Therefore, the genuine source of absurdity is associated with situations of self-attribution of false belief by the agent. Despite its originality, Wittgenstein's solution faces objections. For example, in a certain context, it would not be absurd to assert the sentence 'There are no beliefs, but I don't believe in it', unlike the sentence 'There are no beliefs and I believe that it is so'. The solution proposed by Wittgenstein does not allow us to correct the situation since one could assert quite reasonably and without any absurdity a sentence like ' In fact, there are no beliefs and now I falsely believe that it is so'. Based on Evans' principle of epistemic transparency, some researchers (Atlas, Chan, Kwon, et al.
   ) offer another strategy for solving Moore's paradox, in which peculiar attention is paid to the dependence of understanding and evaluating the meaning of the sentences 'p but I do not believe that p' and 'p but I believe that not-p' from the immediate context of their usage. The source of absurdity should be looked for in the established practice of the self-referential use of the pronoun 'I'. In the researchers' view, Moore's paradox arises only in the context of situations where the agent asserting such sentences is conscious speaking about oneself. Therefore, there is an obvious structural analogy between the sentences of the Liar family ('This very sentence is false', 'Now I am lying', etc.) and Moore's paradox ('p but I don't believe that p', 'p but I believe that not-p') - self-reference is constitutive for both families of paradoxical statements.

DE Wittgenstein; optical; seeing; showing; sign; symbol
AB The article argues that the clarity of linguistic terms that Ludwig Wittgenstein talks about in Tractatus (' ... what can be said at all can be said clearly ... ') does not depend on understanding their meaning, but it has in fact an optical nature. It is assumed to be related to the action of the sign, where the production of meaning becomes possible only in company with other signs. Meaning here plays the role of a regulator of the coherence for signs in order that some factuality (eventuality) takes place (or not). In the very action of the sign, its optical properties are revealed - it displays other signs in itself and is simultaneously displayed in them. This malleability and plasticity of the sign is due to its sensually perceived nature. The optical action of the sign creates a symbolic field, which assumes the role of a meaning conductor. The symbolic emerges as something generic, as the moment when the sign is linked to the rules of logical syntax (otherwise, the arbitrariness of the sign would not allow language to be filled with meaning). It is an expression of agreement to follow a certain attitude (or rule). What matters, however, is not so much the grasping of the content of this attitude per se, but rather the way in which we grasp it - because that is how we follow a rule, not in any other way. And here Wittgenstein's.spade' bends under the heavy burden of grounds, finally reaching 'bedrock' and forcing us to say, 'This is simply what I do' (PI, 217). For Wittgenstein, the role of such 'bedrock' is played by the symbol, which blocks any possibility of its own linguistic expression by the usual means of articulation. The reason for this is the symbol's absolute indifference to its own meaning, the symbol describes only itself, increasing the importance of what is symbolized. This mechanism of 'seeing' the symbol into itself while preserving the obscurity of meaning and simultaneously demanding the clarity of what is eventuating, gives us actual manifestations of the optical nature of the symbol. The optical triggers the function of symbolization by implicitly influencing our sensibility. The optical focusing (gathering) of our sensibility into a single focus enables the symbol to express its instinctive powers, thus making them obvious to us. The gaps between the binding and destructive powers of symbolization are revealed by differentiation and demarcation of these instinctive powers. The optical possibilities of the symbol open in the sign a capacity to distinguish objects in a special way, where 'seeing' does not mean 'understanding' or 'describing' but only 'making visible'; and 'making visible' also means seeing.

AB The prerequisites for the formation (grounds) of conflicts in the Community of the Imperial Tomsk University are investigated. The article is based on the materials of the office documentation, periodicals and sources of personal origin. The aim of the study is to characterize the ethics of the Russian University Community during the late 19th - early 20th centuries in relation to the grounds of these conflicts. The main research methods are comparative historical and historical abstraction. To achieve the aim, the authors considered the conflicts in the Community of the Imperial Tomsk University from the point of view of a number of contradictory trends. These are the contradictions between the personal and corporate interests of the participants of conflicts, between the manifestation of conflicts and their isolation in the Community of the University, and finally, between the adherence to democratic ethics and the need to build conflict behavior depending on the conservative ethics. The main accusations of the participants of conflicts, the strategies of their conflict behavior, the function of the Rector of the Tomsk University, the Curator of the West Siberian educational district and officials of the Ministry of Public Education in conflicts reveal the coexistence of two alternative principles in university ethics. On the one hand, a controversial ethical system separated the Community of the Imperial Tomsk University into two groups. This division was partly based on the criterion of the political views. At the same time, the situation of the conflict forced their participants to choose between two largely contradicting ethical codes. The advantages were accordingly gained by those participants in the conflicts who confronted their opponents with the unrealizable choice: between self-exposure, or voluntary defeat in the conflict, as an adept of the Government (as an informer) and the escalation of the conflict as its instigator. In the first case, the participant of the conflict doomed himself to condemnation of his colleagues, and in the second - to the disfavor of his superiors. It is emphasized that the Professors who found themselves in the conditions of such a choice (S.I. Korzhinskiy, M.A. Reisner, P.M. Bogaevskiy, P.I. Lyashchenko and a number of others) voluntarily or forcibly left the Imperial Tomsk University.

AB The article deals with the problem of interests in law and jurisprudence, their identification as private and public interests, the search for a balance of private and public interests in society. The authors emphasize the change in the nature and essence of the private and public in Russian society in the post-Soviet period. This basis allows proposing theoretical models for the transformation of private interests into public ones and the harmonization of such interests in the general context of social, political and legal development. In the first case, we are talking about trends in the development of society, in the second - about the goal of implementing legal policy based on the coordination of interests. By means of reflexive analysis, the authors highlight the interests in law arising in the conditions of post-Soviet society and their understanding within Russian legal science. The justification of the idea of harmonisation of public and private interests in the system of relations of modern society is equally close to jurisprudence and philosophy, history, sociology, political science as fields of knowledge with many points of intersection and common vision.

TI "BATTLES FOR THE PAST" OR MEDIATIZATION OF HISTORICAL POLICY AND
   HISTORICAL PROPAGANDA IN MODERN UKRAINE

DE Ukraine; Russia; mass media; history politicization; historical
   politics; politics of memory; historical promotion; historical
   battlefields; historical conflict; historical "post-truth"
AB The aim of this article is to analyse the process of historical mediatization of policy and historical propaganda in Ukraine. The resource base of this research were the materials from the Ukraine central periodical publications with different political content, which have relevant web-pages. In addition, certain media and textual materials from popular Ukraine TV channels were also analyzed. At the same time, authors of this article forego the analysis of the network media (social networking, blogs and web forums) and audio, video materials, which demand separate and special review. The subject of this research is the historical narrative in modern Ukraine mass media.
   Media resources act as effective mechanisms to implement historical policy and historical propaganda and also are an important part of commemorative practices. The construction of national and state identity in Ukraine presupposes division within the framework of the common past with neighbors, extension of the national sense and establishment of complimentary view on the "own history". Such a way supposes "the war for the past", which in turn split into the separate "historical battles". The contest and character of such counteractions depend on several reasons, which include political conjunctures, social enquiry, duration of common history, presence or absence of tragic moments. To date, it is not a surprise that the main "historical antagonist" in Ukrainian historical narrative is Russia as having different historical personas.
   Modern Ukrainian mass media authors in different historical materials underline a range of "historical battles", that is, those problems of common history, which generate significant social and political resonance, which is characterized by high intensity of discussion, categorical and irreconcilable assessments and opinions. In particular, "battle for the statehood", "battle for the territory", "battle for the nation", "battle for the language", "battle for the culture and science", "battle for the symbols", "battle for heroes and anti-heroes", "battle for the victory and defeats" are exist in historical narrative of Ukrainian mass media. Thematic areas of "historical battles" are not something stable and static. In contrast, their boundaries are blurred and their context always mixes and intertwines. Except this, the changers of socio-political situation actualize different historical themes, turning them into new "battles for the past". Statements on the common past of politicians of both countries reinforce the polemic fuse and mutual rejection. To date, unfortunately, authors do not see the indicators of the imminent onset of not even peace, but at least a temporary pause in the "historical battles". Obviously, only the political crisis resolution of the Russian-Ukrainian relationship can reduce the intensity of "historical battles", by renouncing the "language of hatred" and overly politicized assessments of the common history.

AB He was intended to understand the process of transforming social and labor relations in the context of the implementation of pension reform in Russia, taking into account the axiological aspects, in particular "digital axiology". Its objective is to identify the impact of digitization on changes in industrial relations in the context of pension reform. The theoretical and methodological basis of research is based on an interdisciplinary system approach and generational value theory. An economic analysis is performed, along with the grouping of empirical data and digitization rates are presented. A survey of more than 6,000 people was also conducted, the theme of which was to assess the impact of the Russian Federation's pension reform on social and labor relations, economic growth and the quality of life of the population. The article examines cardinal changes in the social and employment relationships of people of pre-retirement age in the context of digitization. It is concluded that the main problems of the development and formation of digital axiology among the pre-retired demand a set of political transformations.

AB The article considers directions of the agrarian modernization as presented in the four editions of the Soviet agricultural encyclopedia from the mid-1920s to the mid-1950s. On the basis of some historical examples and theoretical concepts, the author explains the scientific, ideological and political significance of encyclopedias in the formation of social knowledge and ideology; shows how during the Stalinist period, the Soviet agricultural encyclopedias passed through several successive 'great leaps' in the representation of agrarian knowledge under the accelerated Soviet modernization; stresses the manipulative way of managing agrarian knowledge and human capital in agriculture - on behalf of the leader and ruling party. The article describes the transition from the first Soviet encyclopedia of the 1920s, which focused on the modernization of peasant Russia, to the encyclopedia of the early 1930s, which denied the importance of the peasantry and praised the projects of large-scale industrial-agricultural production; many authors of the first peasant encyclopedia were repressed. The encyclopedia of the late 1930s reflects the fight against the authors of the previous encyclopedia of the 'great leap' and the purges in the name of the ideology of the planning-management approach in the further modernization of Soviet agriculture. The encyclopedia of the late 1940s - early 1950s reflects the victory of the technocratic-bureaucratic worldview and personnel approach to the agrarian sphere, which prevailed in the agriculture of the USSR until the very end of the Soviet era. The author focuses on the influence of the subjective factor (political leaders, editors-in-chief and anonymous authors) on the ideology, topics and style of encyclopedic articles. In conclusion, the author notes that the strong ideological control and volatile political situation distorted knowledge in the Soviet agrarian encyclopedias, which negatively affected the quality of rural human capital and largely predetermined the stagnation of rural development in the late USSR.

AB In 2019, Spanish economy maintained the post-crisis growth rates of the 2010s' second half, although they were slightly lower than the average for the last period due to both, political and economic factors. The political uncertainty fueled by the necessity in holding four general elections in 2018-2019 has slowed down the search for consensus on reforming the country's financial system. The decline in domestic demand reflected the evolution of personal consumption and investment, while the contribution of external demand was attributable to a slowdown in imports and slightly stronger exports. Low inflation and almost zero interest rates in banks also provided a favorable situation. By the end of the first quarter of 2020, the generally positive economic outlook was largely undermined by the global economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic which affected humanity in all socio-economic aspects. In the short term, the decline in Spain's GDP and overall business activity is unprecedented since the country's democratic transition that started on 20 November 1975. Even the vibrant Spanish foreign economic sector was tied: both external and internal demand for almost any economy in the world was in an equal crisis state with the start of the pandemic. Many factors analyzed point to a more precarious position in Spain compared to other countries. The Bank of Spain expects the Spanish GDP to fall by double digits in 2020 and it looks like the most realistic scenario. The article analyzes the economic situation in Spain by the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, examines the reaction of the national economy to the coronavirus, the individual measures of the Spanish government and the supranational institutions of the EU to combat the pandemic are analyzed, as well as a forecast regarding the post-crisis future of the country's economy is given.

DT Article
DE "party of power"; Russia's nomenclature; dominant party; United Russia
   party; Administration of the President of the Russian Federation
AB The article presents a factual analysis of the origin and formation of the "party of power" in Russia. The work demonstrates that at all stages the Russian "party of power" was designed and controlled by the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation.
   The research carried out by the author shows that Russia's "party of power" does not meet the criteria that would allow to qualify this political party as dominant, in any of its "incarnations". This fully applies to the United Russia party that does not exert a significant impact on the appointments to the political and administrative positions and does not have any effect on the decisions that determine the state's policy. The dominance of the United Russia party in the electoral field is ensured primarily by the electoral corruption, as well as by the fact that its "electoral machine" is represented by the system of public authorities at all levels, from federal to local. In turn, the dominance of this party in the State Duma and the rigid and strictly hierarchical administrative structure that it built in the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament allows the Presidential Administration to control the legislative process and parliamentary activity in general.
   According to the author's conclusion, the "party of power" is an externally controlled political organization of a party type that protects the interests of Russia's ruling nomenklatura and implements its goals in the processes of the formation of public authorities through electoral procedures, as well as in the course of the legislative and parliamentary activity. Not only does such an organization fail to meet the criteria of the dominant party, but it also fails to fully correspond to the concept of a political party per se.

AB The higher education system, on the one hand, is an important social lift; on the other hand, it is a tool for reproducing the existing social structure. Today it is on the verge of vital transformations associated with the widespread implementation of digital technologies. The forced transition to online education during the pandemic enabled researches to study students' attitudes to digitalization of the higher education and its consequences. The article presents the results of an empirical case, the purpose of which was to study the students' assessments of digital learning in terms of its educational and social perspectives. Four hundred students specializing in social sciences and humanities ( target quota sample) from several Russian universities were interviewed. The choice of the universities was determined by their strong material and technical base, which provided transition to distance education without serious technical difficulties. Using equal allocation, quotas were set on the form of education (budgetary or contractual) and the year of education. The researchers used binary scales - semantic differential and paired comparison of judgements. The semantic differential scale was used to measure the distance between offline and online education. The online format's ability to smooth out inequalities in education were assessed with a paired comparison of judgements. Shifts in the perception of norms and students' educational attitudes were tested through a projective situation of choosing the ideal form of education: only classroom teaching, only online format, mixed form. The forced transition to distance education changed the concept of normativity in higher education and encouraged competition between different forms of education. Classroom teaching is seen as high-quality and fundamental, but is no longer perceived as the only norm in the organization of the educational process. Online learning is associated with rapidly evolving technologies and has an obvious potential for growth. Students assess social consequences of digitalization of the institution of higher education as ambivalent and ambiguous. Digitalization of higher education is not only becoming a source of additional opportunities and a factor contributing to smoothing inequality and building an accessible educational environment, but also a new basis for social inequality, an axis of socio-educational differentiation associated with the accumulation of digital capital.

AB The article studies republican ideas as reflected in the Russian public consciousness of the early 20th century. The material for the research is documents identified in the fond of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Empire of the Russian State Historical Archive (RGIA). In recent decades, the problem field of intellectual history, the methods of which have been used in this research, has expanded dramatically: from studying the "great ideas" of outstanding thinkers of the past to researching such ideas that were accepted by a significant number of educated people. In their study of political thought, historians are increasingly turning not just to statesm.n who held power and were directly involved in decision-making, but to officials and public figures whose influence was indirect. At the height of the revolutionary crisis of 1905 brought about by the Russo-Japanese war, the representatives of the Russian public, together with the government, strove to overcome it as soon as possible. According to the Imperial Edict to the Governing Senate of February 18, 1905, their notes, letters, and suggestions on issues of improving state order were to be sent for consideration of the Council of Ministers; from October 19, 1905 they were directed to its chairman S. Yu. Witte. These documents represent a unique public opinion survey, mostly of representatives of the Zemstvo, urban milieu, and nobility; they have not yet been considered in Russian historiography. Although republican ideas were firmly associated in the Russian public consciousness with revolutionary ideas, as early as in 1905 some fundamental principles underlying modern republican theory were reflected in the political thought of the Russian public loyal to the government. The research shows that many public figures who addressed to the power their proposals for resolving national political crisis, defended ideals of political freedom, preponderance of law over the "human factor" in politics; they saw the main task of the existing and planned political institutions in protecting rights and freedoms of imperial citizens and in realizing interests of the society and proposed to expand the independence of local government.

AB The article examines the relevant theme of "virtualization" of culture and religion, which is actively developing in the transhumanism. One of the concepts of the "digital future" is being developed by William Sims Bainbridge in his book EGods: Faith versus Fantasy in Computer Gaming; it is the main source of the analysis of digital utopia per se and the role of religion in it. The religious hypothesis of Bainbridge is considered, according to which the past of religion appears in the form of games and fantasies; therefore, the religious dimension in modern video and computer games is a prototype of the future "new religion". In the article, conclusions are drawn that modern utopia represents development in the spirit of the apocalypse, first, transforming it into a secular form and, second, offering a "lite" option that can now interest culture not only as an idea, but also as a business project. Therefore, the article identifies the conceptual conditions fulfilling which gives this utopia a chance to influence the development of culture. It is shown that these conditions are related to the methodological approach for the exclusion of a whole range of phenomena - in relation to both religious and gaming experience. It is substantiated that precisely the conceptually "excluded" turns out to be the most important and specific both for the experience of a computer game and for religion this is one of the important conclusions that can be drawn from Bainbridge's arguments. It is shown that the concept, promising a radical renewal, in its essence acts as a variant of the old utopias; the "new religion" exploits the cognitive resources of the "techno-magic"; the intentions that bring to life the idea of virtualization are based on the rejection of the authentic. The active development of the new utopia is not caused by the needs of renewal, but by the intentions of returning to the "proven" versions of the past culture.

AB The issue of socio-economic development of the Khulun-Buir aimag in the Heilongjiang province during the years of the "cultural revolution" is considered (1969-1976). On the basis of monographs and statistical reference books published in China, the problem of the revival of the industrial base and agriculture in both Hulun Buir and Heilongjiang province is considered. It is proved that during these years there was an annual growth of the gross domestic product in the studied regions. Particular attention is paid to identifying the main reasons that contributed to the development of industry and other key sectors of the national economy in Hulun Buir and Heilongjiang province in 1969-1976. It was possible to trace the dynamics of the socio-economic development of the Khulun-Buir aimag in this period, according to which the author singled out three stages: the first stage (1969-1971) is associated with the political course of the CPC Central Committee on "preparation for war" and is characterized by the revival, first of all, of heavy and light industry; the second stage (1971-1975) is associated with the formation of a new policy, which contributed to the annual growth of GDP in the studied regions of China; the third stage (1975-1976) is characterized by an exacerbation of factional contradictions in the Chinese leadership, a sharp decline in the economic indicators of the Hulun Buir aimag and Heilongjiang province.

AB Introduction This article within the framework of Russian-Mongolian relations examines the regional aspect of cultural cooperation between Mongolia and Kalmykia in the Soviet and post-Soviet periods. The authors investigated a wide range of problems related to the place and role of Kalmykia in the history of Russian-Mongolian relations, studied the development of multifaceted interaction between two kindred peoples. Methods and materials. From a methodological point of view, this study is an experience of building a comprehensive vision of the problem. An interdisciplinary, comprehensive approach to solving current research problems makes it possible to synthesize all relevant aspects of studying the historical and cultural aspects of regional cooperation between Kalmykia and Mongolia within the framework of Russian-Mongolian relations. Analysis. 2021 marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of Soviet-Mongolian official diplomatic relations. The Agreement between Mongolia and Russia signed on November 5, 1921 strengthened the military-political cooperation between the two countries, served as a broad international recognition of Mongolia as a sovereign state and played an important stabilizing role in the difficult situation in the Far East. In the 90s of the last century, Russia and Mongolia engaged in profound transformations. The scale of the work carried out by our countries demanded to shift all their attention to solving internal problems, which undoubtedly had a negative impact on the level of relations between the two states. Later, having solved the problems of radical transformations of society, Russia and Mongolia began to restore relations, but on completely new principles. In these conditions, along with other industries, the sphere of cultural interaction between Russia and Mongolia, the development of regional cooperation, becomes significant. One of the Russian regions is Kalmykia, which is linked with Mongolia by ancient historical roots, the unity of culture, religion, language and tradition. These factors play an important role in the further strengthening of good neighborly relations between Russia and Mongolia, in the development of regional cultural cooperation. Results. Studying the history of interaction between the two fraternal peoples in the past and present in the aspect of Russian-Mongolian relations provides rich material for an objective assessment of events in specific historical conditions. Kalmykia, like the border regions of Russia, makes a certain contribution to the strengthening of Russian-Mongolian relations.

DE semantics; meaning; usage; linguistic analysis; John L. Austin
AB In his lectures "Sense and Sensibilia", John L. Austin puts forward a very interesting and provocative idea that sometimes the dependence of two words expressed by terms, in which one is clearly negative and the other is clearly positive, can unexpectedly change to the opposite, that is, when the term, having a negative character, actually performs an affirmative function. It is usually assumed that, firstly, an affirmative use is basic, and, second, a positive word has a positive meaning, and a negative word is a negation of a positive one, which in itself does not add anything to the explanation of a positive word, but only indicates that a positive word may be limited in some situations. However, according to Austin, there are words that perform the opposite function. He suggests calling them "trouser-words". As examples, Austin refers to the words "real" and "freedom", which, although look positive, are intended to negate the negative words implied by the context. That is, "trouser-words" taken in this way, being positive in their meaning, are negative. Examples of the words "real" or "freedom" clearly show that their meaning is set not by the word itself, which looks positive, but by its negation. Austin sought to prove that words like "real" or "freedom" are intended mainly to exclude one, some or all of their opposites. To be free is not to be unfree; to be real is not to be unreal. It can even be said that the presence of negation constitutes the meaning of "trouser-words", and their grammatical function is to exclude the possibility of their opposites in a certain context. Moreover, with the help of the idea of "trouser-words", Austin tried to challenge the assumption that a "positive-looking word" should always be in the focus of philosophers. On the contrary, he insisted that when we ask such philosophical questions as "What is real?" and "What is freedom?", we first need to find out what we exclude thereby and then establish the context in which this exception occurs.

AB The events in the Chechen Republic of the late 20th - early 21th century, especially the counter-terrorism operation (the second "Chechen war"), have become the object of close attention of politicians of various levels and political views, as well as historians, political scientists, sociologists of Russia and the world. The existing assessments of the counterterrorist operation in Chechnya are extremely polarized and numerous also because it almost immediately outgrew a local-regional character, becoming a higher-order phenomenon that has a serious impact on the domestic and foreign policy of the Russian Federation. The problems of preserving territorial integrity and the right of nations to self-determination, the need for a tough fight against terrorism and respect for human rights, conducting military operations using the army on their territory and preserving the constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens are intertwined in one tangle. The Russian, European and American expert communities have paid and continue to pay considerable attention to various aspects of the problems related to the conduct of the counter-terrorism operation in the Chechen Republic, its consequences, results, and the current situation in the region, giving assessments according to their political views and preferences. However, in general, the huge volume of accumulated sources and various research papers on this problem can be stumped - at least the most preliminary work is required to assess the historiography of the "Chechen wars" and specific problems related to the nature of the source base. The peculiarities of the internal policy of the Russian Federation, its involvement in armed conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, the unstable situation in the Caucasus as a whole, undoubtedly have an impact on the intensification of terrorist manifestations in Russia. Moreover, the roots of a number of emerging problems go back to the period of the counter-terrorist operation in the Chechen Republic. Terrorism has evolved in recent years, destabilizing the internal State security for a long time. And although at present the situation in this direction is steadily normalizing, new threats nevertheless appear, and they require scientific understanding and the organization of counteraction on a scientific basis.

AB The article is devoted to the study of the content of extra-textual records - marginals in the margins of handwritten Qurans, recorded by Dagestan oriental scholars at different times while working with written monuments in private and mosque book collections of highland Dagestan. It was established that most of the discovered marginals were made in Arabic, however, since the beginning of the 18th century, such records were often kept in local languages using Arabic script. It is shown that the Quran, due to its sacred functions, became a repository of the most important documents of various nature. It is reported that extra-textual recordings are extremely diverse in their content, they affect many aspects of the socio-political, spiritual, economic and cultural life of the region. The experience of studying marginals over the past several decades is summarized. The author of the article draws attention to the newest findings of the Qurans made by archaeographic expeditions in 2017-2019 in private book collections in the Shamil region of the Republic of Dagestan. It is emphasized that an analysis of their thematic composition and a scientific description of the manuscripts stored in them will give an idea of some aspects of the social, cultural and religious life of the peoples of Dagestan.

DE conceptual analysis; methodology of social science; qualitative methods;
   analytic philosophy
AB The article explores the problem of the relationship between quantitative and qualitative methods in sociology. Since the quantitative approach claims to identify the structure of sociological reality and the qualitative one to identify causal relationships, it is proposed to consider this problem in the context of the relationship between description and explanation. Following Herbert Blumer, I believe that the gap between these methods arises due to the uncertainty of sociological concepts, but, at the same time, I critically consider the solution he proposes. The latter consists in the sensitization of concepts, which implies that the concept should not be considered from the point of view of theoretical criteria, but as explaining some practice. In my opinion, this leads to difficulties in disseminating concepts within the scientific community, and also does not allow them to be corrected in order to bring them into accordance with practice. Instead, it is proposed to use the analytical approach of Arthur Danto, which he uses to describe the philosophy of history, but with minor changes it could be applied in sociology. At the first stage it is necessary to formulate a description of a sociological phenomenon that allows a nomological explanation in the framework of Carl Hempel's scheme. Danto's central idea here is that any phenomenon can be given such a description (although it may be hard to find). Further, using formalized concepts, which are logical constructions from individual attitudes, an explanation of this phenomenon is compiled by including it in a line of other phenomena already described. As a result, conceptual analysis plays a dual role in the social sciences. On the one hand, it helps to formulate correct descriptions of phenomena, and, on the other hand, it acts as a tool for explaining them.

DE arms control; crisis; Cold War; Russian-US/Western relations;

AB Throughout the Cold War, the arms race was driven by an ideological confrontation between two superpowers representing two antagonistic social systems, socialism and capitalism. However, at present, representatives of the elites of the United States and Russia are trying to recreate elements of the new "farcical" Cold War leading to Russophobia on the one hand and anti-Westernism on the other. Since the Gorbachev Perestroika era and especially after that, relations between the two countries have gone through several repeating cycles, beginning with hopes of establishing a new type of relations charcaterized by close cooperation and partnership and ending with a period of deterioration in relations. For a number of perfectly rational reasons, the United States and the USSR, as the main conductors and participants in the arms race, initiated the process of arms control, which supposedly acquired its own positive momentum. However, it turned out that this process was tied to the state of political relations and was not capable of achieving positive results without a favorable political environment. As a result of the deterioration in political conditions, progress in various arms control areas, one by one, came to a halt. Moreover, it turned out that the decades-old arms control system may be on the verge of total destruction, which almost became a reality after the Ukrainian crisis of 2014 and, especially, during the Trump presidency. The extension of START III, which took place almost on the verge of a political and negotiating "foul", raises the question not so much about the technique of compromise on the way to a new treaty, but of how to ensure the continuity and effectiveness of the arms control process, which is a key element of strategic stability.

   V.N. Lamsdorf
AB This study focuses on the efforts of the Russian delegation at the Portsmouth Peace Conference to include in the peace treaty a clause on Japan's recognition of the full independence of Korea and the early withdrawal of troops from its territory. The article was written on the basis of a wide range of sources, most of which are being introduced into scientific circulation for the first time.
   The article provides a description of the international situation before the start of the peace negotiations. The attempts of the Japanese government to start peace negotiations with Russia in July 1904 are described, in particular, the detailed content of the proposal of the Japanese envoy to London T. Hayashi to the Russian Finance minister S.Yu. Witte about the meeting in Berlin to discuss the terms of peace is presented for the first time. Various opinions in the Japanese government about the supposed conditions of peace are considered, the change in the mood of the Russian government in favor of ending the war and the preparation of peace negotiations with Japan in March 1905 is shown, the meeting of the Minister of Foreign Affairs T. Delcasse with the Japanese envoy to France I. Motono on April 5 to clarify possible grounds for peace negotiations is described in detail.
   The author considers the role of the US President T. Roosevelt in the preparation and conduct of the peace conference, as well as his attempts to ensure a leading role in the settlement of the Russo-Japanese conflict. In particular, this includes his proposal of "good offices" in March 1905 and the discussion of the issue of mediation at a meeting with ambassador to Washington A.P. Cassini on March 30. His attempts to persuade the Japanese delegation to accept the terms are disclosed.
   The article reproduces in detail the debates on the Korean question, the exposure of the aggressive nature of the Japanese demands by the Russian delegation at the conference, and advocacy for the preservation of Korean independence. It analyzes the arguments and demands of the Japanese delegates to the answers and proposals of the Russian representatives.
   As a result of the research, the author came to the conclusion that the sovereignty of Korea was not shaken by the Portsmouth Peace Treaty. Although, under the treaty, Russia recognized Japan's predominant political, military and economic interests in Korea, the Russian government did not intend to violate the principle of Korean independence, which was the basis of Russia's policy in the Far East. At the same time, the recognition was stipulated by the obligation of Japan, fixed in the protocol of the conference, not to take measures affecting the sovereignty of Korea without the consent of the Korean government. This recognition became the only foreign policy obstacle to the complete destruction of the independence and territorial integrity of the Korean state by Japan for the whole five years after Portsmouth.

AB Introduction. Due to the destabilization of the situation in the countries of the South Caucasus in 2020, the region is of particular relevance today. At the present stage, it is an object of geopolitical competition for numerous international actors: the Russian Federation, the United States of America, the European Union, the Republic of Turkey. The article examines the EU policy in the process of implementing the Eastern Partnership program as part of the European political strategy. In relation to the South Caucasus region, the interim results of the EU's activities on the implementation of 20 deliverables for 2020 in relation to the states of the South Caucasus are analyzed. Methods. Comparative analysis makes it possible to give a comprehensive assessment of European policy in the region by identifying priority areas and development prospects by comparing the intermediate results of 20 deliverables for 2020 in the South Caucasus countries within the framework of their bilateral relations with the EU. Analysis. The analysis of the activities of the European Union in relation to the South Caucasus countries is associated with the determination of the prospects for the development of the European strategy in the region. The analysis included tracking the dynamics of the implementation of the 20 deliverables for 2020 in relation to Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia, as well as options for developing a European strategy in the South Caucasus countries, taking into account the new policy in the context of the Eastern Partnership beyond 2020. Results. As a result of the analysis, the EU's competitive advantages in the South Caucasus were determined by identifying areas in which the EU's geopolitical interests intersect with other actors.

AB The article considers the formation of scientific interest in the study of language mediation of the phenomenon of aging. The reasons for the demand for gerontolinguistic knowledge are analyzed, and the arguments justifying its relevance are given. A brief excursion into the history of scientific research on aging is made, but the focus is on its linguistic aspects. The natural sciences were the first to study the aging process, which formed the biomedical paradigm of its consideration. Later, gerontology was constituted as an attempt to form a broader view and a deeper understanding of the ontology of aging. As a result, new areas of research on this phenomenon have emerged: social, psychological, economic, political, and cultural perspectives. The formation of a systematic interest in the language side of aging occurred later than others, but the emergence of gerontolinguistics brought awareness of its high heuristic and practical potential both in understanding the ontology of aging and in applying the knowledge gained to implement the strategy of active and healthy aging. The article considers the main vectors of research on the relationship between language and the aging process, and presents the existing interpretations of the term "gerontolinguistics". It is shown that gerontolinguistics is becoming an interdisciplinary field that accumulates the efforts of the entire body of gerontological knowledge aimed both at maintaining the language health of the aging population and at implementing the strategy of active and healthy aging in the transition to a hyper-age society.

DE Historical sources; selective nature of Soviet justice; corruption;
   malfeasance; documentary sources; Great Patriotic War of 1941-45; USSR;
   economic crime; economic deviancy
AB The article determines the assets and prospects of using historical sources stored in the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History (RGASPI) for disclosing problems of economic crime in 1941-45. Understanding modern dangers of corruption, illegal enrichment, and malfeasance requires studying the historical experience of the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45. It was a time to confront not only a strong external enemy, but also internal challenges, including, in particular, activation of criminal elements in the economic sphere. Despite an abundance of legal and historical publications devoted to economic crime and combating it, a whole layer of archival documents remains outside the field of research. The study has been carried out on the basis of institutional methodological approach using source heuristics, source analysis, historical-comparative method. The documents revealed in the RGASPI consist of previously unpublished materials of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Party Control Commission under the Central Committee of the CPSU, regional and city party committees (obkoms and gorkoms), and political departments of various agencies, through which transportation and distribution of food and industrial goods was conducted, as well as fragments of national leaders' personal provenance fonds. The analyzed documents reflect criminal acts characteristic of the war period: speculation, embezzlement, bribery, malfeasance of high-ranking officials. The aforementioned delicts are reflected in the minutes of meetings, reports, certificates, and directives describing in detail the most common types of economic crime and measures taken by the authorities to curb it. The study concludes that the identified documents possess a high degree of objectivity and confirm the thesis of numerical growth and expansion in range of economic crimes in wartime social crisis. As main strategy for combating the growth of economic crimes throughout the war, the national leadership used a tough punitive policy, but these measures did not give tangible results. The effectiveness of domestic policy measures aimed at ensuring protection of state property, as well as personal property of citizens decreased due to deterioration in the quantitative and qualitative composition of the judiciary and political pressure from the party leadership, as well as selective nature of Soviet justice and use of unnecessarily harsh punishments, while deviance resulted from need and hunger.

TI FUTURE 2049: THE POLITICAL POTENTIAL OF LATE POSTMODERNISM
SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE practical philosophy; future; postmodernism; cult cinema; Blade Runner;
   Blade Runner 2049; capitalism; politics
AB The article presents a reading of the film Blade Runner 2049. The author maintains that postmodernism is an "epistemological category" rather than an "ontology," i. e. it exists only as a universe of various theories that in different ways describe contemporary culture as a postmodern one. Hence, many theories have arisen that attempt to supersede postmodernism with a language for describing current culture, e.g. cosmodernism, metamodernism, performatism, digimodernism, automodernism, capitalist realism, etc. The proponents of these theories all share one strategy they illustrate their own ideas by alluding to various films: Jurassic Park, American Beauty, Avatar, etc. The author finds this approach insufficiently productive and turns instead to the culturological method elaborated by Philip Wegner, who characterizes the era through periodization grounded in comparisons between different films (e.g. original Cape Fear and its remake, the first three parts of the Terminator franchise).
   The article shows how Blade Runner since the 1980s has been interpreted as a "postmodern film." The author considers different approaches to the film's analysis, including political interpretations that followed from postmodernist interpretations and concludes that Blade Runner 2049 marks out a gap in the periodization of the era between the original film and its sequel, i.e. from 1982 to 2017 ( the release dates of both films) and from 2019 to 2049 (the temporal setting in both films). Because of the thematic continuity between the two films, Blade Runner 2049 could be considered an example of the "late postmodern" era, and the sequel resolves many problems that were only sketched in by the original film. Blade Runner 2049 offers an indication of how political problems of the future might be solved in the present by means of artistic representation.

DE Caucasus; border guards; Kara border brigade; smuggling; bandit

AB The process of formation and development of the protection of the state border in the Caucasus at the end of the 19th century (using the example of the Karsk border brigade) is analyzed in the article. The relevance of the study is due to the fact that in historical research insufficient attention is paid to the protection of the state border in the Caucasus by border guard units at the end of the 19th century. It is shown that under the conditions of the introduction of protective customs duties, as a result of which smuggling activities began to develop actively, without specialized units, the Russian Empire was unable to protect its economic interests in the border space in the Caucasus. It is noted that the development of the state border guard system was carried out in a tense, unstable military-political situation, accompanied by constant armed clashes with bandit formations. It is indicated that in these conditions, the protection of the state border was carried out by the border guards together with military units, which in turn negatively affected the quality of the protection of the economic interests of the Russian Empire in the region. It is concluded that the development of the system for protecting the state border in the Caucasus was a consequence of the existing threats to national security in the region.

AB The textbook Methodology of Scientific Research (For Candidate and Doctoral Dissertations) by G.D. Boush and V.I. Razumov is aimed at improving the methodological skills of scientists (postgraduates and doctoral students), in particular, at forming the competency "ability to independently organize and conduct scientific research". The authors emphasize the independence of research; therefore, the textbook is distinguished by its practical orientation. It aims at forming the skills of the activities mentioned in the competencies. The textbook has four sections and seventeen topics. In Section 1, "Introduction to the methodology of scientific research", the authors set out the theoretical foundations of scientific research, as well as the regulatory requirements for dissertations in the Russian Federation. Section 2, "Organization of the preparatory stage of scientific research", contains a description of methodological technologies for the development of the concept and program of research, the formation of the author's methodology, requirements for the culture of the researcher. Section 3, "Methodological approaches and methods of scientific research", describes methodological approaches that make up the basic platform for the course methodology, as well as several classes of categorical methods that allow researching the essential aspects of the chosen object at a high-quality level. Section 4, "Processing and presentation of the results of scientific research", contains a description of methodological technologies that allow organizing of the results of scientific research effectively, to present its description and results in scientific texts of different formats. The methodology of scientific research is based on the author's categorical-system methodology, which has proven itself as a highly heuristic search platform that allows generating new knowledge in a wide variety of fields, as well as preparing students for highly productive scientific researches in any field, solving problems of any complexity. Therefore, the textbook is addressed to postgraduates and doctoral students of all areas of study. The textbook meets the current requirements of the Federal State Educational Standard for Higher Education. The textbook can be recommended to postgraduate students of all areas of training; doctoral students, lecturers of the course "Methodology of Scientific Research" and related academic disciplines, as well as other researchers.

AB This article is devoted to the conceptual analysis of the collection of national mottos of the Japanese nation, which was published in 1944 in Manchukuo. The book includes thoughts and statements of Japanese political and public figures, soldiers, philosophers (including Chinese ones), writers and poets. Chronologically, the collection covers the time from the appearance of the first written works of the Chinese philosophy (approximately 7th century BC) to the beginning of the 20th century. The book was released at a difficult time for Japan and the world, when war was going on in Europe and the Pacific. For the Japanese Empire, the point of the war turning against its favor occurred in the summer of 1942, during the Battle of Midway. From this time on, Japan gradually loses the initiative in conducting offensive operations against the Americans and their allies in the Pacific Ocean. Since the Japanese military situation deteriorated, the government began to strengthen its propaganda measures aimed at strengthening the idea of opposing European colonialism under the aegis of the Country of the Rising Sun, which was, in Tokyo's view, shared by all East Asian nations. Apparently, as a part of this campaign, the Harbin branch of the Japanese Telegraph Agency "Nisso" and the Patriotic Association of Writers published a collection of mottos of the Japanese nation, which was intended to "spiritually unite" the Japanese subjects living in Manchukuo and promote an increased understanding of the Japanese mentality and Japanese culture among the Russian speaking population of East Asia. Targeting Russian population did not happen by chance. In the conditions of "common misery for all"1, Japan, apparently, planned to enlist Russian emigrants living in Asia. The collection considered in the article has become a bibliographic rarity today. The philosophical sayings, judgments, and appeals contained in it are of great interest for studying the past of the Country of the Rising Sun, as well as its ideology during World War II, and for understanding the essence of Japanese nationalism. The mottos included in the brochure reveal the general ethnic features of the Japanese, their attitude towards life and death, as well as such concepts as "duty", "homeland", and "honor".

AB A little-known fact in the history of churchstate relations on the territory of Siberia is considered: the reforms that affected theological schools and public education in 1918-1919. The relevance of the study is due to the unresolved problems of teaching religious subjects in modern Russia. The author's attention is focused on the figure of Vasily Vasilyevich Sapozhnikov, an outstanding researcher and geographer, traveler who during the Civil War held the post of Minister of Public Education in the anti-Bolshevik governments. The most important event is covered-the Siberian Council Meeting of 1918, which was a continuation of the Local Council of 1917-1918 at the local level. It is shown that it was at the end of 1918 in Tomsk that representatives of non-Bolshevik political parties, public figures and clergy tried to resolve the long-awaited issue of changes in the structure of spiritual education in Russia, as well as in the reform of teaching the Law of God in Russia. The novelty of the study lies in the fact that it managed to combine the literature about Vasily Sapozhnikov published over the past decades with the recently published documents on the Siberian Council Meeting.

DE interethnic relations; Republic of Buryatia; sociological monitoring
AB Modern challenges, threats and risks associated with accelerating migration flows, interethnic conflicts, facts of terrorism and extremism dictate the need for continuous monitoring of trends in the development of interethnic interaction in the Russian Federation. This is especially true for multi-ethnic regions. The article analyzes the data of a sociological research conducted in Buryatia in 2016-2019. It considers experts' and population's assessments of interethnic relations, prospects for their development, as well as the influence of ethnicity on vertical upward mobility opportunities. Factors that pose a threat to stable interethnic harmony in the region are identified; these include the deterioration of the socioeconomic situation in the country amidst the global economic crisis and sanctions, low living standards of the local population, the use of political technologies during election campaigns to politicize ethnicity and ethnic mobilization, the destructive influence of Internet communications which spread protest sentiments. The conclusion is made about the need to increase the level of the socioeconomic development of the republic, which is reflected in the citizens' quality of life, their social well-being and assessments of inter-ethnic relations. There is also the need to strengthen the potential of interethnic harmony in the republic as a resource for consolidating society, to prevent interethnic tensions, and to work more effectively and comprehensively in the educational sphere of the republic on creating an effective system of patriotic and international education.

DE protests; Belarus; field of communication; social activity
AB The article examines the features of political communication in a modern network society on the example of protest events in the Republic of Belarus that took place after the elections of the president of the Republic of Belarus in 2020. As a conceptual approach, a systematic approach is used, which considers the entire public space of the state (the entire sphere of its political communication) as a system. The article analyzes one of its parts - the subsystem responsible for political communication in the Internet space. The aim of the study is to establish the information impact from the external environment on the network subsystem of the state's public space. The object of the research was the political and communicative field of the Internet platform for supporting Facebook social networks. Two empirical methods were applied. One of them is a quantitative content analysis of the information and text array consisting of messages posted by residents of the Republic of Belarus on Facebook, indicating a number of keywords (hashtags). Based on the results of the content analysis, a change in the dynamics of user political activity in the information field of the Facebook Internet platform was established. The second method is computer simulation. Two situations of manifestations of social indignation in society are modeled: (1) without influence from the external environment and (2) implying influence. Having carried out a comprehensive, generalizing analysis of the results of the content analysis and computer modeling, the authors established that there is an impact from the external environment on the political communication subsystem considered in the article. Sources (impulses) of impact are news stories spread by representatives of foreign states in relation to Belarus. They are expressed in the form of statements by official representatives of foreign countries and members of international organizations. The authors conclude that the strengthening of a similar informational impact in the current political situation can lead to the activation of political communication of the country's residents in the network public field.

DE Fyodor Dostoevsky; Friedrich Nietzsche; nihilism; tradition; modernity
AB The article aims to analyze the influence of Nietzsche's concept of nihilism on the Russian culture and to consider its contexts in Dostoevsky's fiction and social and political essays. The study proceeds from the statement of difference between the construal of nihilism in European philosophical tradition that has culminated in Nietzsche's works and its meaning in Russian culture. For Nietzsche, the term "nihilism" meant the objective, albeit terrible and threatening result of the historical development of European culture. Russian nihilism boiled down to the subjective stance of indiscriminate negation that was based on the whimsical combination of ideas borrowed from European atheism, materialism, positivism, and utilitarianism. However, both in Europe and Russia of that time, nihilism disclosed the values and even absolutes as immanent and thus constructed entities. It should be also observed that in Europe the overcoming of nihilism confined itself to the search or construction of the immanent substitutes for the overthrown values and absolutes, while Russian culture in many respects still remained traditional. From this perspective, the vicissitudes of confrontation between modernity and tradition as it was perceived by individuals in the face of the coming nihilism turn out to be the implicit background of Dostoevsky's writings. Whereas Nietzsche's approach to the problem of overcoming nihilism was based on his concept of superman as a peculiar point of view or a peculiar, singled out perspective and was associated with the idea of the "eternal return", Dostoevsky, in tune with the principles of Russian philosophy, relied on the retention of the elements of tradition as an antidote against the nihilistic tendencies of modernity. Such a stance implies the revision of the metaphysics of modernity as a certain pattern of relations between part and whole. It also implies a different approach to the resolution of contradictions and therefore a distinct construal of identity and difference as it was demonstrated in Dostoevsky's speech on Pushkin that introduced the famous idea of the "universal responsiveness". No matter whether Dostoevsky's stance is utopian or not, he still not only argued that he belonged to the tradition of Russian philosophy with its ideas of all-unity and Sophianic unity, but also became one of those who in a way anticipated modern controversies on metaphysics, identity, and difference.

AB The article is devoted to the influence of the problem of the status and situation of the Hungarian population of the Transcarpathian region of modern Ukraine on the Ukrainian-Hungarian relations. Based on a wide range of sources - legislative acts, interstate agreements and other diplomatic documents, statements of politicians and public figures, published in the Hungarian and Ukrainian press, as well as in the media of other countries, the dynamics of changes in the approaches of the two countries to the Hungarian issue in Transcarpathia throughout the post-Soviet period is studied.
   The prerequisites and reasons for the aggravation of relations between Ukraine and Hungary in the 2010s are determined, including both the features of the historical, cultural and socio-economic development of Transcarpathia itself, and the transformation of the political systems of the two countries.
   The key factors that provoked the acute Ukrainian-Hungarian crisis in the mid-second half of the 2010s were the educational and language policy of Kiev, aimed at Ukrainization, as well as the refusal to make concessions on the autonomy of the Hungarians of Transcarpathia. At the same time, the issue of Transcarpathian Hungarians is only part of a larger problem of Ukrainian domestic and foreign policy - an attempt to form an ethnocentric model in a multicultural society.

AB The article deals with virtual exhibition activities of the central state archival institutions of Ukraine associated with the anniversary of the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45. The authors acknowledge that archives are an important institute of memory for Ukraine, and therefore they attempt to assess the impact of the official Ukrainian historical and political policy on the exhibition activities in the central state archives, using on-line exhibitions dedicated to the anniversary of the Victory of 1945 as an example. The Great Patriotic War is one of the most contradictory elements of the Ukrainian national historical narrative and one of the most conflictogenic elements in the Ukrainian historical policy (in the so called "wars of memory"), hence the choice of the topic. The authors have studied the webpages of the archives' official sites, their structure, design, and content. They focused on the digests of on-line exhibitions, i.e. texts located on home pages of the archiv, which reveal theme, concept, purpose, and objectives of exhibition. The authors have tried to identify the patterns in using the concepts of the 1941-45 events, assuming that vocabulary and definitions contain most important information on the influence of official historical and political policy on the work of archival institutions. The authors have also studied the thematic design of on-line exhibitions, in particular, the military symbols used in web design. The research has showed that the concept of the Great Patriotic War was persistently changed to the concept of World War II in all five exhibitions, although some sections of the exhibitions featured both. The article notes that design of at least two exhibitions used the European symbol for victory over Nazism: red poppy instead of red carnation and St. George's ribbon usually used in the USSR. Use of the poppy image and substitution of concept of the Great Patriotic War with non-synonymous concept of the World War II is a shining example of the influence of Ukrainian state historical and political policy on the work of archives. The researchers argue that it is impossible to deny the significant influence of the controversial official Ukrainian historical and political narrative on the nature of the expositions. However, in general, the exhibitions are characterised by moderate political engagement, demonstrating a certain scientific independence of the Ukrainian state archives.

ID FORESIGHT
AB The article examines the phenomenon of morality in the framework of modern projects of construction and research of the future (futures studies). The article aims to determine the situation in which the moral content in modern practices of constructing the future can be found. This issue is of interest since not so long ago the presence of moral content in how we speak and think about the future was not a subject of consideration for researchers of the future, although it could be implied in the discussed concepts. Today one can see a methodological, but not theoretical, focus on moral issues, which obviously forms a lacuna for researchers of moral problems. It seems important to understand whether it is possible to find moral content in statements about the future, and, if so, what content it is. Is it a utilitarian consequence of maximizing happiness while minimizing unhappiness for all, or is there a "Kantian" duty in these statements? The article proceeds from the fact that modern deontological philosophy was in a situation where the rejection of classical transcendentalism, which occurred at the beginning of the 20th century, led to the fact that the argumentation of moral transcendentalists (primarily Kant) lost its convincing force, but negative consequences of accepting the augmentation of moral materialists (primarily Hegel and Marx) still remain obvious. The second important premise is that difficulties with the formulation of a moral law made ethics seek alternatives, and, most likely, moral conventions became an alternative. Thus, the main thesis of the article is as follows: statements about the future possess moral content, but this content represents a weakened Kantian obligation in the spirit of respect for conventional consent (like Habermas or Rawls suggest). To substantiate the thesis, the article refers to the instruments of modern moral theory and the philosophy of language. Firstly, the article examines the nature of the transition from an epistemological view on the study of the future to an ontological one with the aim of determining the situation in which moral content can in principle be found. Secondly, the article examines statements about the future themselves for the presence of moral content in them. Thirdly, based on the conclusions from the first and second sections, the article investigates the nature of moral obligation in situations of constructing the future. The author comes to the conclusion that moral content in how we think and speak about the future, if it can be found, is most likely, firstly, to be of a conventional nature, since the persuasive power of classical transcendentalism and moral materialism today looks questionable. Secondly, the convention procedure and, accordingly, its results can be the subject of a Kantian sense of impartial respect for the universal norm and thus fill the future with classical moral content with certain restrictions if they satisfy the requirements for such procedures (detailed in the works of Apel and Habermas). Thirdly, a moral assessment proceeding from the principle of personality value is the most preferable for objects constructed in the future and is most fully represented in the category of a "preferable future".
   Fourthly, finding the moral content in the category of "preferred future" allows speaking about the proximity of this content to the deontological ethical concept and the fundamental possibility of universal moral content, since, firstly, the "preferred" future is always a mental construction, with a very conditional connection with the "existing" and the "possible". Secondly, in the preferred future, the values of the individual may be most fully represented; these values, in one way or another, are moral content for deontological concepts. Thus, moral content in modern projects of futures studies is most clearly manifested when working with the "preferable future" and observing the construction of and adherence to the required communication procedures, to which a feeling of Kantian respect can subsequently be shown based on a sense of universality and impartiality.

AB The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the subject of the article is the question of the influence of L. D. Trotsky [Bronstein], who was one of the key leaders of Bolshevism, who headed the October Revolution, on the worldview and creativity of M. M. Prishvin, which has not yet been considered in the European studies. It is shown that in Russian art it is difficult to find an artist of the word, whose work would be to the same extent conditioned by the influence of the ideological and political context. The novelty of the study lies in the fact that for the first time an attempt was made to show how, through individual characters in his works, Prishvin in an artistic and figurative form reflected the characteristic features of behavior, everyday habits, the style of thinking and speech of Trotsky. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of previously unpublished due to censorship restrictions of the writer's works: the story "The World Cup", journalism of the revolutionary years and the 18-volume Diary, which became available to the reader only in the post- Soviet period. It is shown that, depicting Trotsky as a "pharmacist" who, according to his recipes, is trying to create the future of a huge country, Prishvin seeks not only to artistically reflect his moral appearance and personality traits, but also to convey the features of the ideological and political struggle in Soviet society.

AB The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the subject of the article is the question of who was the real prototype of the Chekist Sutulov in Prishvin's novel "Tsar's road", which has not yet been considered in the history of foreign affairs. It is shown that in Russian literature it is difficult to find master of the pen, whose work would be to the same extent conditioned by the influence of the ideological and political context. The novelty of the research lies in the fact that for the first time an attempt was made to show how, through the artistic image of the Chekist Sutulov, one of the main characters of the novel "Tsar's Road", Prishvin seeks to reflect the ideological and political attitudes, characteristic features of behavior, style of thinking and speech of Stalin. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the 18-volume "Diary" of the writer, which was not previously published due to censorship restrictions, which became available to the reader only in the post-Soviet period. It is shown that, through the artistic image of Sutulov, Prishvin gives his personal assessment of Stalin's role in the development of the state, striving to artistically faithfully and truthfully reflect the characteristic features of that atmosphere of economic, political and spiritual super-tension in which Soviet society lived in the 1930s on the eve of the Great Patriotic War.

AB The article describes the attitude of the German conservative thinkers of the XIX century towards social policy. Works by Carl von Haller, Adam Muller, Wilhelm von Ketteler and Carl von Vogelsang are studied, the philosophic background of their views, and the impact of their arguments for the intellectual history of Germany. Their conservative critique of capitalism and socialism is studied. The paper also analyzes the conception of "sustainable development" understood as an approach towards economy that is focused not on the increase of production, but on maintenance of acceptable level of welfare. The article presents ideas of corporate organization of society that can restore the harmony of medieval social, political and economical relations. The ideology of aristocratic paternalism is explored together with its philosophical and religious foundations as well as its focus on the preservation of social peace and its concern about the needs of the population. The article presents the claims of the conservative thinkers on the value of the nonmaterial components of the social life, which serve as the foundation for social policy, namely respect towards tradition, responsibility, service, trust, justice, frugality, religiosity. The emergence of the German conservatism is explored in relation to Russian political philosophy. The article shows that the scientific and public activity of the German conservatives led to the introduction of social laws in Germany and Austria.

DT Article
DE international students; university city; education policy; Australia
AB Studying the problems associate with international students in host communities seems to be an extremely urgent scientific task of our time, attention to which is paid from the standpoint of economics, sociology, psychology, pedagogy and a number of other sciences; not the last place in this order is occupied by political science. Russian Federation, along with long-term leaders represented by the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Germany and France, was actively involved in the struggle to attract foreign students, which became possible, not least due to the inclusion of domestic universities in the struggle for advancement in international academic rankings, as well as staging within the framework of the National Project, tasks to increase the export of education. Despite the obvious advantages of such a solution, expressed in the form of an increase in the international status of Russia as a center of science and education, economic benefits, there are also significant risks both for students (international and Russian) and for the host community. In this regard, the main aim of the work is to identity the main problems faced by international students in Australia, a state that is one of the generally recognized leaders in the export of education, which has experienced a significant quantitative increase in recent years. The choice of Australia as a research object is associated with a number of factors: a jump-like growth of foreign students similar to Russia in a short time; the sustainability of the higher education system has become dependent on one importer (China); emerging problems, specific cases, are raised for discussion both by the state (for example, in the form of open government reports) and by the media, which does not happen in other leading countries. As a result of the study, the following conclusions were obtained Australia has experienced an exponential and very ill-considered increase in the number of international students in recent years. The reliance on attracting students from China, thanks to which the main growth was ensured, and the change in the order of public funding, put universities in serious dependence on Beijing, with which political tensions continue to grow. Reorientation to other markets (for example, India and Nepal) leads to a decrease in the level of students' training, including language, which, as a result, has a devastating effect on the level of Australian education in general. In the current crisis situation associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian government made international students "unwelcome guests" which also has significant image losses.

AB The aim of the article is to study European integration and the expansion of the European union together with the Atlantic alliance during George W. Bush's second term (2004-2008), for which the historical method was used. Despite the tendency that most researchers in the field of modern history and political science tend to focus on current events, and according to this logic it would be more appropriate to analyze Trump's foreign policy, in order to better understand the contemporary tension between the EU and the United States, today it is imperative to take a look at some contemporary historical processes. It is concluded that, to which George W. Bush's rhetoric has much in common with Donald Trump, he also laid the groundwork for change in U.S. foreign policy during Barack Obama's presidential term (2008-2016). The one-sided approach promoted primarily during George W. Bush's first term went from a gradual transformation of coalition building and the full support of the Atlantic alliance allies for the operation in Afghanistan in 2001, to more controversial rhetoric about "rebel states."

AB The article analyzes the role of school education in the context of the origin and subsequent evolution of French political republicanism, which was implemented in the form of "France-republic" or "nation-republic". As noted in the article, the need to achieve the homogeneity of the nation at the political-right level in the conditions of the heterogeneous French society in reality brought to the fore the topic of the formation of a republican political culture cemented by the principle of secularism. One of the most significant areas of application of the principle of secularism, laid down in the foundation of the French republican tradition, was school education. Through various cases, both historical and modern, the article defines the French specifics of the use of the school as a tool for asserting republican values and maintaining the cultural homogeneity of the republican polity. Noting that since the 1789 French Revolution, the issue of school education in France has been politicized, the author of the article demonstrates how this problem has become an important element of sociopolitical discussions in the format of speeches, reports and journalistic texts (for example, the projects of Ch. M. de Talleyrand, N. de Condorcet, E. J. Sieyes, etc.), and in the practical plane was formalized in various constitutional and legislative acts. It is emphasized that the top of the legislative process in this area was the " laws of J. Ferry", who is rightly considered the architect and creator of the French "republican school". Thus, the foundations were laid and the most important principles of the organization of education - universal, secular, free of charge, etc. - on French soil were formulated, as well as the tasks of the education system as an important sphere of state structure designed to form and reinforce the public virtues of French citizens. Within the framework of the republican tradition, the organization of school education is declared an obligation and duty of the state to its citizens. Special attention is paid to the new draft bill "Reinforcing Republican Principles", which was initiated in 2020 by French President Emmanuel Macron with the aim of reconstructing the "republican order" and protecting one of the most important republican values - the principle of secularism. It is concluded that, at the present stage in France, one can observe the reactualization of the tradition of protecting republican values through school. The school system is used as a tool of "reinforcing republican principles", but is undergoing reform to adapt to the new challenges of national identity.

ID SYMPOSIUM COMMEMORATION
AB Introduction. Memories of past events often become objects of political manipulation, when the interpretation of events that are significant for Russian history turns out to be dependent on the political preferences and attitudes of public actors. Manipulations are aimed primarily at schoolchildren and university students, them being the most active part of society with significant protest potential. The article, based on the study conducted, systematizes the representations of past events in the collective memory of young people in the multiethnic regions of the Volga Federal District (Russia) to evaluate the influence of alternative ethnic and regional narratives on the state and potential development of the ethno-confessional situation in the regions under examination.
   Materials and Methods. The study was based on the materials of a mass sociological survey conducted among students (n = 1,246, October 2020), in the Republic of Mordovia, Chuvash Republic and the Republic of Tatarstan. First- and second-year students of the largest universities of the republics were interviewed. To identify regional differences, respondents who came from other countries and regions were excluded from the data obtained.
   Results. The results of the mass survey conducted among young people in the Republic of Mordovia, Republic of Tatarstan and the Chuvash Republic have revealed the fragmented perception of Russian history. In the historical memory of the youth living in the ethnic regions of the Volga Federal District, significant events of the Soviet past have dominated, although in some cases they have been perceived and reconsidered through the prism of ethno-confessional practices. At the same time, alternative ethnic and regional narratives that could negatively affect the socio-political situation in the republics have practically not been captured in the historical consciousness of the youth.
   Discussion and Conclusion. At the present stage, the regional symbolic memory policies of all three republics do not fundamentally contradict the memory policies of the federal center. The results of the study will be useful to social scientists, as well as public figures engaged in youth policy.

ID AGENDA CONTROL
AB The article deals with discontinuity procedure as a political technology used to reject legislative initiatives in case a Parliament has not adopted a public political decision in a scheduled time. Complementary veto players theory by George Tsebelis is used in this article. In particular, the authors set out to study not only institutional and partisan veto players, but also the other participants in the legislative process: veto actors (in other words, "gatekeepers"). The authors create a concept of "veto-technologies", enabling the expansion of the analytical potential of the theory through studying specific initiative-blocking technologies such as discontinuity. In this article, we review studies on the discontinuity of political science, the features of its influence on the parliamentary agenda, and the timing of legislative initiatives. During the study on the use of discontinuity in fourteen countries, the authors identified universal procedural characteristics that determine the configuration and significance of this technology in the legislative process: the effective period (session, convocation, calendar year); the conditions under which discontinuity is not applied; the document that consolidates the discontinuing procedure. The authors also offer an analysis of this theory's application in the Russian Empire. The possibilities of applying discontinuity in modern Russia are considered in three dimensions in which the Government works with the State Duma: institutional, partisan, and positional. In the meantime, the procedure can be established through the amendments to the Regulations of the lower house. This obviates the need to coordinate such a decision with other institutional veto players. Discontinuity in perspective can help eliminate the political risks of making unpopular domestic and foreign policy decisions and, as a result, strengthen Parliament's position in relations with the other public authorities. Adverse effects of the introduction of discontinuity may be the further development of non-public and informal procedures to negotiate the positions of stakeholders, as well as a decrease in the political weight of ordinary deputies in comparison with veto-actors setting the parliamentary agenda.

AB Soviet trade with Eastern European countries was one of the main forms of economic interaction within the socialist camp. The problem of imbalances in this trade traditionally has been associated with the politicization of intra-bloc relations. However, when harmonizing the interests of the USSR and the socialist interests vis-a-vis long-term trade agreements, economic motives were of great importance. This article discusses the process of harmonizing economic interests, using the case of Soviet-Polish trade relations in 1958-1964. This research based on archival documents from the Department of the Central Committee of the CPSU for Economic Cooperation with the Socialist Countries (in RGANI) and declassified documents from the special fund for the State Planning Commission of RGAE. The analysis shows that contradictions in trade issues provoked a discussion of a wider range of issues: military supplies, credit debt, and transit tariffs for the two countries. Moreover, each of the parties was guided by its own economic interests and rarely made concessions for political reasons. The Soviet government in 1958-1964 made a number of supply concessions, agreed to revise transit tariffs, and incurred part of the costs of maintaining the stability of intra-block trade in the distribution system. There was a change in the structure of Soviet-Polish trade, which significantly reduced the passive trade balance for Polish People's Republic (RPL). Nevertheless, in accordance with Soviet calculations, after all these changes, trade with RPL and other socialist countries was profitable for the USSR.

DE social optimism; happiness; Altai Krai
AB The article discusses the social optimism of the inhabitants of Altai Krai. A sociological study conducted in 2018-2019 showed that the majority of the residents express social optimism in a short-term perspective. The ambiguity of such results in their interpretation is due to the fact that Altai Krai does not have high quality-of-life indicators in comparison with other regions of Russia, but most people consider themselves to be happy and optimistic. The research of the features of social optimism manifestation among the inhabitants of the region has resulted in revealing an important aspect: a contradiction between the real conditions of people's social life and their moods and assessments of social reality. It is suggested that such a situation is possible due to a more rational - and not only emotional - attitude of the population to the events and processes taking place. This means that the population has become more rational in assessing the situation in the region on the basis of socioeconomic and sociopolitical indicators of regional development. Social optimism is formed not only in connection with expectations and hopes for a better future, but also with balanced assessments of the state of the economy and the actions of the state and local authorities in this direction. Thus, social optimism is considered both as a social resource and as a personal resource, when people begin to assess their role in the life of the state, society, region, and not only the effective or ineffective activities of the authorities, etc. The metaphor "A ray of light in the Kingdom of Darkness" used in the article is an indicator of the existential and rational state of the modern resident of a Russian region with low living standards, who is not losing faith and hope for a better life in the near future. At the same time, this metaphor has a real basis: the formation and strengthening of social optimism among residents of Russian regions are ever more realistic, with residents resting responsibility for the state of regional development not only on the authorities but also on themselves.

TI NAPOLEONIC ERA IN PERCEPTION OF MODERN FRANCE
SO FRANTSUZSKII EZHEGODNIK-ANNUAIRE D ETUDES FRANCAISES
LA Russian
DT Article
DE historical memory; French science; the image of Napoleon; traumatic past
AB The article is devoted to the modern French historiography of the Napoleonic era in the context of the concept of historical memory. Even though many new methodological works have appeared in European science in recent years, offering alternative options for reading historical memory, French historical science is far behind methodological innovations. Based on an analysis of the methodological and historical principles of French research, the author identified two main areas developing in relation to the history of memory of the Napoleonic era. Firstly, the study of the image of the emperor as an instrument for the formation of political symbolism and factors contributing to its actualization. Secondly, research into the problems of constructing a memory of tragedies as an element of national consolidation. At the same time, researchers noted that the images of defeats, thanks to regular actualization, turned out to be most memorable for the French than the victories of Napoleon. Within the framework of this direction, the author emphasized the monograph by J.M. Largeaud, dedicated to a detailed analysis of the specifics of the French memory of Waterloo. The author concluded that historians appeal to the tragic images of war is usually limited to the national framework. So, turning to ideas about wars, historians only fragmentally touched on the problems of Russian and British memory, once again demonstrating the exceptional concentration of French science on problems of a narrowly national nature. Finally, most of the work continues to focus on the concept of P. Nora, which, apparently, cannot be perceived today as a universal approach to the problems of historical memory.

DE Anastasians; family homestead settlements; Roerichism; territorial
   development; rural areas
AB Several new religious movements (NRMs) imply certain distancing from civilization and society; due to this, some of their followers relocate from cities to the countryside. Perceptions and practices common for most NRMs may be based on fundamental ideological differences, and the settlers' way of life directly depends on the teachings they follow. We have recorded striking differences in the ideology and life patterns of two large-scale and significant Russian NRMs: The Ringing Cedars of Russia, or Anastasianism, and Roerichism - a movement uniting followers of Nicolas and Helena Roerich and their teachings. (1) Values and lifestyles. In Anastasianism, a person can create paradise in their ancestral estate (family homestead) rather than wait for death to attain it. Anastasians focus on the family and activity pertaining to the arrangement of their house and land. In Roerichism, the purpose of existence is transition to higher worlds, which implies personal growth and spiritual development. Roerich's followers settle closer to nature to achieve harmony of spirit and contribute to culture, which should facilitate their rebirth in a better world. (2) Potential for the development of the area. Anastasians establish family homestead settlements in vacant areas. It is assumed that the homestead will become home for all future generations of the family. Roerich's followers move to existing settlements connected with the life of the artist and his family. They do not seek to "bind" their children and grandchildren to the area but strive to prevent the possible destruction of the "place of power" important for them. 3) Relations with the local population. Proponents of both teachings are alienated from the host community. Anastasian settlements are isolated from the surrounding localities, while Roerich's followers keep aloof from the other villagers. Both are often perceived by locals as eccentrics spoiled by urban life or as sectarians. Anastasians find no understanding among the locals and often annoy them with their alien and seemingly irrational behavior, lifestyle and thinking. Roerich's followers are criticized for being inappropriately demanding of conditions, as well as for unconventional approaches to education. 4) Prospects. Anastasians face problems (informal construction, lack of understanding on the part of local residents), which can be resolved only through institutionalizing their movement and the settlements they have established. They are putting a lot of effort into legitimizing their position. Roerich's followers live legally in existing settlements, and their social activities are more understandable to local residents. At the same time, their focus on the spiritual quest entails uncertainty regarding the further development of the community.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE political science; classical political philosophy; representation;
   Gnosticism; retheoretization
AB The article discusses the project of the retheoretization of political science proposed by political philosopher E. Voegelin. By means of retheoretization (restoration) of the classical Platonic and Aristotelian political philosophy, Voegelin attempts to provide an answer to the discredited positivistic worldview of man, politics and history. Voegelin's political philosophy evaluates critically both the methods and the subject matter of political science, explores the human nature and reality of human existence in society and history, comprehends relations between knowledge and reality, penetrates the sources of the disorder of society, probes the limits of instrumental rationality, and establishes an ontological basis for political epistemology. His aim is to regain a truth of political order that has been lost through the process of modernization. In developing the theme of retheoretization, he distinguishes between classical political philosophy as represented in the works of Plato and Aristotle, on the one hand, and the modern understanding as conceived by positivism on the other. Voegelin argues that modern political science, like modernity in general, is the result of the great Gnostic revolution. Retheoretization, he insists, would return political science to the kind of enterprise founded by Plato and Aristotle, and overcome the effects of positivism with its emphasis on emulating the methods of natural science and establishing a value-free mode of inquiry. The article concludes that all of Voegelin's topics are part of his overall plan for the restoration of a true science of politics. This plan, as the authors of the article argue, in A New Science of Politics is not only outlined, but also partially implemented, and Vogelin's work itself is an example of a restored political philosophy.

A deep state is a networking structure integrating various interest groups in a low-profile format; its resource superiority enables it to control the country's social and political process partially or completely. With the course of time, it is procuring of reproduction of its structure that inevitably becomes the priority aim of the deep state. It can take on numerous quite specific forms; meanwhile, its power can be ensured both by the military and security resources and by less heavy-handed means.

AB The genesis of global capitalist society envisages the appearance of classes bracing the whole humanity - transnational (global) capitalist class and transnational (global) proletarian class. The concepts of American scholars I. Ness, D. Strun and M. Enner, dedicated to various aspects of existence of the global proletarian class, are discussed in the article. The author undertakes a research on the duration of working time, productivity of work and life time as the main characteristics of the social being of proletarian classes in the leading world countries. One of the indexes of development of the country's productive powers is the use of industrial robots. The productive powers development and work productivity growth result in gradual displacement of manual work by intellectual work and in increase of the creative content of work. These processes lead to a decrease of working time and appearance of the free time phenomenon. The labor and trade union movement in Western countries and the example of the social policy in the USSR also contributed to a decrease in the duration of working time, but were of secondary significance. At the same time, the decrease of the set duration of labor at enterprises does not mean the "end of labor" since creative labor technically fills in the free time. The border between working time and free time in the conditions of high-tech economy vanishes. The analysis of the leading world countries demonstrates that life time depends not only on social and economic factors (income, quality and quantity of commodities, level of medicine and education, etc.), which is finally determined by the level of the country's productive powers development. The geographic location (proximity to a warm sea or an ocean), climate and nature of national nutrition traditions influence life time. It is prompted by the paradox of Chile: being a developing country with an average level of work productivity, life time in the country is close to developed countries or even overpasses them.

The paper attempts to ground the notion of institutions of culture and their necessary, though sometimes ambiguous role in social, cultural as well as political dynamics of the current history. Studies of the present experience in economic, information and demographic globalization, digital technologies, pandemics, etc. offer new opportunities for rethinking the role of cultural institutions in the whole socio-historical process, including the current history. The complex of these problems is displayed not only on macro-historical or global level, but also on the levels of micro-histories and everyday history in different social and cross-cultural contexts. The field of cultural institutions seems to be responsible for the whole shifting of basic human values in history as well as for the "subtle customization" of interpersonal communications and "le phenomene humaine" itself.

DE frequency interpretation; subjectivist interpretation; Bernoulli's
   theorem; stability of frequencies; independency
AB The article studies the foundations of criticism offered by the followers of the subjective interpretation of probability theory, namely Kolmogorov's condition about the proximity of the theoretical probability and empirical frequencies in the context of using mathematics. They consider this requirement to be redundant as it is deducible on the basis of Bernoulli's theorem being its conclusion. In my opinion, the question of redundancy of this condition has not only a historical value, but is also topical, because the inference about Kolmogorov's error is based on using Bernoulli's theorem and the problem of using mathematics does not receive adequate attention. To analyze the soundness of this criticism, I formulate the conditions of using Bernoulli's theorem in the frequency interpretation, because Kolmogorov remarked that regarding applications he followed Mises, the founder of the frequency interpretation. These conditions are: the correct use of the theorem presupposes estimation of the probability of success in research and verification of the independence of its results. I show that the verification of result independence is a hard problem, and, for this reason, the models of independent trials are usually accepted on informal foundations. I offer arguments in favor of the formal verification by means of Elyasberg's example. The example demonstrates that the dispersion of the sum of a thousand of independent random values differs from the dispersion of the sum of a thousand of weakly connected random values with a pair correlation coefficient 0.01 by more than one order. In contrast to the frequency interpretation, the requirements of using the subjective one are limited by accepting probability axiomatics only. Subjectivists believe that the probability of success in research and the independence of its results are known a priori. It appears that the using of the theorem by subjectivists does not guarantee objective results and, in fact, is not correct in the context of requirements to applications in the frequency interpretation. Thus, the criticism of Kolmogorov is not sound.

Contemporary mythology does not limit to theoretical constructions and serves as a tool forming historical memory of the Visegrad Europe countries that became considerable opponents in policy of Brussels in the last years. The origins of the idea of Visegrad relationship and transformation of the Habsburg myth in the interwar period and after the Second World War are considered in the article. The article deals with examples of hierarchy of the Habsburg myth in political and cultural spheres and in a daily life of Visegrad Europe nations and their immediate neighbors.

AB The authors of the article have studied the causes of the American Civil War with due regard to the history of constitutional law. This research is based on several political, economic, legal and cultural factors. The authors used the method of analyzing historical documents. After analyzing judicial precedents and global historical trends, they have concluded that America's constitutional institutes lost their effectiveness and became a weapon in the hands of struggling parties during the constitutional crisis. As a result, the compromise system of the early nineteenth century became a new state and legal structure.

AB The objective of this paper is to consider the mapping of the national question in focus of periodical press, referring to the fact that the press not only served as a mirror of the events unfolding at the University in 1905, but it acted as an important lever of influence on the public opinion and the University world, and in this sense acted as a factor of the processes unfolding within the University. The source base of this research was made up of materials published in St. Petersburg newspapers that represented various political trends: "Birzhevye vedomosti" ("Stock exchange news"), "Novoe vremja" ("New time"), "Russkie vedomosti" ("Russian statements"), "Peterburgskij listok" ("St Petersburg sheet"), "Svet" ("Light"). This allowed us to reveal how various political forces related to the national movement of students and what importance they attached to it. The authors turned to the method of content analysis in order to collect data on the events connected with St. Petersburg University, its professors, and students. The research suggests that the beginning of the First Russian revolution in 1905 was a catalyst for the growth of activity and radicalization of the national movement among the students of St. Petersburg University. In the conditions of the general revolutionary rise in the whole Empire, various national and political preferences and a system of self-identification in relation to the Empire and the Russian liberation movement were formed among the national student communities. The right-wing press, seeing national minorities as a potential threat to the monarchy, used news stories about the activity of national student associations as an additional opportunity to discredit them. The liberal press, also not missing such events, thus promoted national movements, considering them as an important element of liberalization. Thus, it promoted their institutionalization and self-identification of national elites.

DE Aleksandr I; Rupasov; Finland in search of foreign policy guidelines
AB The article analyzes Finland's attempts to find a solution to current foreign policy problems in the interwar period. The main problem was the search for possible allies and guarantors of independence. The solution to this problem was complicated by a complex of factors: the limited interest of the great powers in accepting obligations guaranteeing the preservation of independence by Finland, the political and military weakness of possible allies (Latvia and Estonia), contradictions in relations with Sweden (not least caused by domestic political aspects both in Finland and Sweden), fears about Poland's foreign policy ambitions, potentially dangerous Finnish involvement in crisis situations Domestic political consensus on the issue of foreign policy orientation seemed to be achieved in the mid-1930s. However, the so-called Scandinavian orientation did not even partially solve the security problem. By the beginning of the pan-European crisis, the search for guarantors of independence remained an unresolved problem.

AB The article summarizes the results of the Fourth All-Russian (national) research conference "History, Economy, and Culture of the Medieval Turkic-Tatar States of Western Siberia". It took place in the city of Kurgan on October 30, 2020. The conference was held on the Zoom platform due to the current epidemic situation. From various regions of Russia and the Republic of Kazakhstan, 34 researchers took part in it.
   The reports were chronologically and thematically divided into the following areas: the issues of the historiography and source studies of the political and ethnic history of the Siberian states; the Tyumen Khanate and its heritage, the Siberian Khanate and its neighbors; and Western Siberia from the end of the sixteenth to seventeenth centuries: politics, population, and culture.
   The speakers summed up and set new prospects for research on the problems of archaeological and historical source studies related to Siberian statehood, the ethno-social and political history of the Tyumen and Siberian yurts, and issues of political relations of late medieval Siberian states with their neighbors including the Muscovite state and the Bukhara Khanate. In the latter case, it was proposed to consider these relations in the context of larger geopolitical realities in Eurasia in the sixteenth century. Special attention was paid to the discussion of Tatar-Ugric relations which continue to be a promising research area. The problems and chronology of the entry of the Turkic-Tatar and Ugric peoples of Western Siberia into the Russian state were discussed as well. Further ways of studying the problems of the history, economy, and culture of the medieval Turkic-Tatar states of Western Siberia were considered for the preparation of the next conference in Kurgan in 2023.
   Using the possibilities of interdisciplinary research by specialists in the field of history, archaeology, ethnology, numismatics, and genetics is of great importance in determining the prospects for further research. Taking into account the limited written base of sources on the history of Western Siberia of the late Middle Ages and early modern period, interdisciplinarity and a combined approach can solve some controversial issues and problems, as well as provide us with new potential opportunities to study the history of the Tyumen and Siberian Khanate.

DT Article
DE scientific creativity; computer games; fundamental science; collective
   intuition; media reality
AB In the article the thoughts about science as a creative process are presented in the context of the historical-cultural epistemology, specificity of which is presented in the material by B.I. Pruzhinin and T.G. Shchedrina. Tendencies in the modern world's development - social, economic, political, communication - do not give rise to doubts about the presence of a paradox: the more globalized the world becomes, the more science gravitates towards the status of applied - this determines its effectiveness. Nonetheless, what is lost when emphasizing efficiency? To answer this question is worth remembering that the intellectual revolution in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries was based not only on the works of Bacon, Descartes, and Newton but also on the radical position expressed in Machiavelli's "Sovereign" who placed utility above virtue. As soon as science becomes a pragmatic business, prestige, fame, safety, and comfort begin to depend on its success. Knowledge is power, but in the new political and social realities, the main thing is practical, utilitarian, and effective. By becoming disciplinary, technical, science gains power but is this power not limited to its own constructions? Para - doxically, science, performing a service function, begins to lose the status of an instance of meaning. Serving society, it, nevertheless, is not a connecting force in society - they resort to it for recipes and solutions, but they do not consider it as a common cause, and as a platform for social interaction, they expect a product from science, but not meanings and values, benefit, but not virtues. However, what is a product of science? How is its performance measured? And who determines the effectiveness? This article attempts to partially illuminate these issues, including in the field of their consideration existentially loaded aspects of the scientific community's creativity - aesthetic, technical-digital, including computer games. Collective intuition as the acquisition of new experience, as the creation of previously nonexistent contexts in which new objects, events, and phenomena are placed all these are key conditions for a world of uncertainty in which science is already required not only objective results but also involvement in the joint comprehension of existential projects. Truth there is not always the result, but rather a beginning, which requires, among other things, the derivation of all scientific consequences for which other forms of habitation of experience are open - aesthetic, playful, performative.

AB The research issue of this article is the development of the image of the future world order from the perspective of the main players on the world stage - Russia, the USA, China - and a clarification of how they see the development of international life at the present stage. The hypothesis of the proposed article is that modern Russia (in theory and in practice) is more in the zone of political economy and economic policy than in the field of economic diplomacy. There is a predominance of the power and negative sanctions regime as a manifestation of protectionism in geopolitics and the world economy. In the crisis Russian-American interaction, US sanctions against Russia, whose economic development is on a growth trajectory until 2029, are still and long expected. Russia and China will continue to demonstrate stable economic partnership and friendly relations. Economic diplomacy could well be an alternative to liberal capitalism in the near term, and its peacefulness and ethics a categorical imperative in interstate relations, in which the economy moves forward, outstrips politics and ensures the country's internal development. The US would still like to remain the first among the world's powers and lead the whole world, including Russia and China. However, the country is hampered by serious internal problems and a decline in the authority of the global leader. The transformation of the system of international relations is constrained purposefully for various reasons. Having the experience of uniting countries and peoples around it, Russia takes a clearly waiting position. China is aimed at long-term domestic economic development in order to become a superpower by 2050. The decisive factor in creating a new world order, possibly first in the space of Greater Eurasia, will be the position of Russia. According to the author's research, 2023 is the upper cyclical limit of the outgoing ("iron" and militant) age of civilization and the continuing of a gradual change in the world political elite. This involves the end of military conflicts and the formation of a new political map on Earth. The peaceful transition to another system of international relations with entry into the era of creation is very relevant for all countries of the world. Economic diplomacy is considered as a real potential, as an effective tool of international organizations and foreign policy of the countries of the world, in terms of making constructive foreign policy decisions, implementing a reasonable personnel policy and timely rotation of political elites, as well as the further development of foreign economic activity and cooperation between states in the 21st century. The mission of Russia, China and the United States is to fulfill the stabilizing functions of the world order and to create, together, in a timely manner, the most acceptable system of international relations.

DE phenomenology; proof theory; space of proofs; intuition
AB In the paper, I investigate phenomenological foundations of the finitary proof theory. The main motive of the investigation is the fact that the finitary proof theory contains some interesting phenomenological reflections. The phenomenological description is expected to promote progress in logical investigations and mathematical applications. The convergence between symbolic logic, mathematical reflections and phenomenological researches will be good for mathematical foundations. In this case, the term "foundations of mathematics" is used in the extended sense. It includes not only logical components of mathematical structures but also phenomenological descriptions of proving. For that reason, I attempted in the paper to combine the efforts of logicism, mathematics and phenomenology. I am guided here by experiences of Gottlob Frege, David Hilbert, Edmund Husserl, and Kurt Godel. The initial point is Frege's approach to formalization of mathematical theories on the basis of logical fundamental laws. Further consideration of the matter leads to the proposition that the finitary reasoning in mathematical logic is closely connected with phenomenological descriptions. The rigorous phenomenological description also offered the opportunity to define the space of proofs. The space of proofs is the specific form of thinking suitable for representations of logical propositions. In the present definition of "space of proofs", I make with Emil Post's definition of a "symbol space" in which any work leading from problem to answer is to be carried out. I will also follow Alan Turing's thesis concerning the "behaviour of the computer" and his "state of mind" at any moment. According to Godel, any mathematical theories are incomplete. However, these theories can be extended with the help of logical and phenomenological procedures. These procedures require a deep understanding of cognitive processes. If we want to find the common ground between logic, mathematics and phenomenology, we must answer the following questions. How Godel's appeal to Husserlian phenomenology should be understood? What did he want to achieve using phenomenological methods in logical and mathematical investigations? Godel held that phenomenology is a very important method of investigation of cognitive processes.

AB The 13th century was undoubtedly a period of upheaval in Baltic history. From the traditional "Estonian" point of view, between 1208 and 1227 ancient Estonians heroically defended their political and personal freedom and native religion, but unfortunately they had to surrender to German invaders and the Catholic Church. This interpretation was adopted by the Estonian audience by the end of the 19th century. However, there were not many individual historical heroes to find in medieval history who could fit the national narrative. The 13th-century sources mention very few Estonians by their names. There is one exception: Lembitu, the leader of Sakala province. In 1217 he was killed in battle; his head was cut off and taken away by crusaders. Numerous artistic presentations popularised the person of Lembitu in the 19th and 20th century and shaped the public image of Lembitu as a king-like leader of the resistance in the name of freedom and independence. At the same time, in the early 2000s parallelly an ironic or critical attitude towards traditional presentations of the medieval warlord developed. A new turn in the presentations of Lembitu in Estonian media happened in the 2010s. The topic then became connected to the question of the fate of the skull of the medieval warlord. In Estonia in the 1960s, a report began to circulate that somewhere in Poland the head of Lembitu still existed. The Estonian Ministry of Culture initiated in 2014 contact between the Estonian and Polish ministries of culture, which resulted in some investigations in Polish museums with the aim of locating the artefact. The initiative was renewed in 2017, and in 2018-2019 the Estonian Ministry of Culture funded the research of the sources of Estonian history in Poland. Although the aim of the research in Poland was defined broadly and had real scholarly results, for the media and public audience it was definitely the project "searching for the skull of Lembitu". The public need for a historical hero, local patriotism combined with tourism marketing, and at least during the last decades the playful handling of history or historical stereotypes shape in combination the presentations of Lembitu in Estonian media and culture today.

AB The subject of analysis in this article is the historical representations of Russian youth as an element of their civic consciousness. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study is an interdisciplinary complex of political-psychological and historical-political science approaches. Historical representations are a form of reflection in the minds of people of events, phenomena and personalities of the past in the totality of their characteristics and properties. Historical representations in the structure of civic consciousness of young people determine the temporal projection of the image of Russia as a socio-cultural and political entity, in relation to which young people self-define as citizens. The empirical base of the study was made up of in-depth interviews with youth representatives. As a result of the analysis of empirical data, the general characteristics of the historical ideas of young people were revealed. The youth's perception of the past is clearly emotional. Attitudes towards historical eras are determined by their subjective assessment by young people. Historical representations are fragmented and have low cognitive complexity. Historical figures of the past are hardly examples of citizenship for young people. The perception of the past is determined by the currently actualized political values, the key of which is justice. It is argued that the revealed features of the historical ideas of young people are due to the psychological specifics of this generational community and the features of the formation of historical consciousness in the process of socialization. The difficulties of constructing the image of the past as an element of civic consciousness of young people are associated with contradictions in the activities of socialization institutions (family, school, media), the peculiarities of the implementation of historical policy and the transmission of historical memory in the public sphere. The need is noted for the formation of a holistic and consistent image of the past among young people through systematic and regular work with young people in the framework of various directions of state policy.

TI THE UNDERGROUND HERO AND THE PROBLEM OF SELF-IDENTITY IN MODERN CULTURE

   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA Russian
DT Article
DE problem of self-identity; Fyodor Dostoevsky; Underground Man; modern
   culture
AB The article analyzes the text of Notes From the Underground in the aspect of the cultural problem of self-identity. The authors show that the appearance of the Underground Hero, whose philosophy and attitude to reality are caused by the specific cultural and historical factors of the modern era understood as modernity in an expanded sense. Such factors are Descartes's ideas about the thinking subject and the process of individualization of society, the influence of which, according to the authors, is due to the enhanced consciousness of the hero. In this enhanced consciousness, the authors see the main source of problems with self-identity in the hero of the Notes. Due to the excess of thinking, the Underground Hero understands the conditionality and limitations of socio-cultural roles. The rejection of the absurdity of social relations turns into an inability of participation for him. The endless stream of intertwining thoughts and experiences turns into a burden for their bearer and makes such a person unfit for action and unable to objectify oneself in any socio-cultural forms. Further, the authors show that similar features are found in other iconic literary characters of modernity - Hamlet by William Shakespeare and Roquentin by Jean-Paul Sartre. In the authors' opinion, the tragedy of the Underground Man is that he is not able to feel as integrity. The ontological incompleteness is compensated for by his attempts to find grounds for integrity in his own self, which is expressed in baseless claims to totality and, ultimately, is resolved in emphatic exaltation. Such an experience is achieved in the ultimate existential tension, in which the "I" is put in a borderline state of transition when one's sense of reality reaches ultimate tension. In this sense, it is directed against the monotonous routine of the rationalized everyday life of modern culture, in which a person is assigned the role of a function, a "pin", a "piano key", etc. In the case of the Underground Hero, the sense of the real is stretched to the limit in suffering. Suffering, thereby, becomes an essential feature of a person. On the one hand, a person who claims complete freedom of self-determination rejects any attempts to define it from the outside. The reverse side of such a pose of denying authority is a painful doubt about the legitimacy of such self-justification since forming one's image one understands that one relies on nothing other than one's own thinking. By constructing one's personality on one's own, a person exposes oneself to selfcriticism. However, it is this emphatic exaltation that makes the Underground Man invulnerable to any form of cultural totality. This apparently is the logic of the formation of the free individual's selfidentity. In the end, the authors come to the conclusion that a thoughtful reading of the text convinces of the futility of any attempts to fit the individual essence of a modern person into any of the group identity frameworks. No amount of participation will return the much-desired sense of ontological completeness to this person.

AB This article focuses on the works of Georges Palante (1862-1925). The author notes that in contemporary European socio-political thought there was a renaissance of this thinker. In particular, his ideas became the foundation of the modem post-anarchism theory. Since both the movement of post-anarchism and the concepts of G. Palante are hardly known today in Russia, it is necessary to talk about this French philosopher. The study consists of two parts. The first part examines the historical context. The main topics of Palante's works were determined by his polemic with Emile Durkheim, the founder of the French sociological school. Therefore, to avoid a misinterpretation of Palantian ideas, it is necessary to consider that this thinker primarily positioned himself as a social scientist. The second part focuses on the philosophical aspect of the Palantian heritage. Namely, the author examines a succession between the article "The mentality of the Rebel" and A. Camus' essay "The Rebel". Even though Camus didn't mention this work, he agreed with Palante's concepts in general, so it is possible to assume the link between two thinkers. In conclusion, the author discusses the relevance of Palantian ideas for contemporary social, political, and philosophical sciences.

TI ENTROPY OF PROPERTY IN WESTERN AND RUSSIAN LEGAL DOCTRINE AND PRACTICE

DE Entropy of property; split property; property right; proprietary rights;
   property contract; trust property management; reception; trust; civil
   law
AB The subject of the study is a phenomenon of an "entropy" of property, its interpretation, socio-economic conditionality, genesis of its development in European and Russian doctrine, reflection of a construct of "separated" property in the legislation. "Entropy" of property is a situation when both entities are owners, but in different areas of relations: the first person is the owner in relation to third parties, and the second-in relation to the first The goal of this scientific research is to find out reasons of the existence of phenomenon of "entropy of property" in European and Russian legal doctrines, to identify common and specific features of this phenomenon.
   Methodology. The authors use the general scientific method, including dialectics, comparative analysis, formal logic, historical method. A number of specific methods pertaining to the legal science were used as well: the formal dogmatic method was applied for analysis of ownership within the institute of property rights; the logical legal method was applied to study general tendencies of development of the institute of property rights; the legal comparative method was used to study European and Russian legislation on ownership and other property rights.
   The main scientific results. The Western legal doctrine of "entropy of property" has quite a long history of development, unlike the Russian. Specific features of the Russian doctrine are result of its historical, political and cultural characteristics. The phenomenon of "entropy of property" has both positive and negative consequences, which requires pluralistic approach to its assessment. "Reunification" of ownership rights on the land plot and other objects located on it, is a result of socio-economic and legal factors and deserves positive assessment. Property rights as elements of titular possession are not based only on law, but may be created by contract as well.
   Conclusions. The European and Russian legal doctrines on the "entropy of property" have both common and specific features. The common features are: existence of "absolute" ownership, limited property rights, trends of reunification of "separated" property etc. The specific features are: absence of "trust" in the Russian legal system; excessive fragmentation of right of ownership as a large "bundle" of rights; absence of situations when one person may simultaneously hold statuses of owner and holder of a limited property right in the Russian legislation.

AB Article is devoted to the distribution of image of Byzantine capital, Constantinople, among cities in the State of Epirus in 1215-1230, that was described in the epistles of local high clergy. This process was closely tied to political ambitions of the Epirote ruler Theodore I Doukas (1215-1230) and consisted of alternate attribution of the rank of capital to Arta and Thessaloniki that implied using for them terms common for Constantinople. At the same time clergy interpreted this practice as temporary measure that was caused by preservation of idea about Constantinople as the main Byzantine city, which legitimized the power of emperor.

AB This study discusses whether the concept of societal security is embedded in the Rus- sian formal and informal discourses as well as in the Russian strategic documents on national security and the Baltic Sea region. Particularly, the paper describes four paradigms of international relations (neorealism, neoliberalism, globalism and post -positivism) and theoretical approaches to the concept of societal security formulated in them. On a practical plane, Russia has managed to develop - together with other regional players - a common regional approach to understanding societal securi- ty threats and challenges in the Baltic Sea region. These challenges include uneven regional development, social and gender inequalities, unemployment, poverty, manifestations of intolerance, religious and political extremism, separatism, large-scale migration, climate change, natural and man-made catastrophes, transnational organized crime and cybercrime, international terrorism, so-called hybrid threats, disharmony between education systems, etc. In 2017, Russia and other Baltic countries agreed that the Council of the Baltic Sea States would be the regional institution to implement a common societal security strategy exemplified by the Baltic 2030 Agenda Action Plan.

AB This article aims at analyzing the performance of international organizations in the sphere of peacemaking operations in the 2019-2020 years. During the detailed description of UN performance, the author concludes that every year the UN holds about 20 peacemaking operations with 180 000 persons involved. The main UN missions are situated in the African region. In general, the UN missions provide the region with stability and decrease conflict. However, the region undergoes the consequences of COVID-19, which seems to be another option for the next peacemaking operations of the UN. Amid the performance of the UN, which is deeply involved in the peacemaking process, the measures of preventive diplomacy of OSCE do not look so successful. The level of confidence between the states seems to be decreasing, which also results in the absence of regular reports on the military expenditure of states - members of the Organization. Except for the crisis of confidence, the tensions between Russia and Europe are likely to rise, which also negatively influences the dialogue between the countries, unsuccessful attempts to stabilize the situation in Ukraine, and the resurgence of conflict in Nagorny Karabakh. Referring to the history of NNW peacemaking operations, the author states, that despite 3 peacemaking operations only, being a regional Organization, NATO attracted the most number of personnel involved in the peacemaking process. At the same time, the peacemaking is not the only purposes of the Organization. NATO is also involved in Mediterranean sea patrolling, staff training in Iraq, air monitoring in Ukraine. Among the members of the Organization the military expenditures are also rising. One of the reasons for such situation lies in the crisis of relations between Russia and its European partners. Being also a military organization, NATO seems to be using this crisis in its political goals and in such a way intensifying its influence on international arena. The following circumstances should be taken into consideration for building a proper political course of the State as well as holding effective political dialogue with its partners.

High political activity was shown by professional socialist politicians, who fought for power, and the economic elite of the city. The former ones were at the head of the self-government and, using the experience of the revolution, tried to mobilize employees, tenants, workers, poor and indigent residents of the city to participate in the elections.However, the socialists, who lost their influence and authority, could not overcome the political apathy of broad layers of the population. Against the background of mass absenteeism, large entrepreneurs who sought to restore the social status lost as a result of the revolution managed to unite and attract medium and small homeowners. The high level of the electoral activity of these categories of the population ensured the victory in the elections.

AB During the last two decades, the topic of imperial consciousness and the ideological construction of a neo-imperial approach to contemporary Russian history within the narrative of post-Soviet "neo-imperialism" has been increasingly revived in Russian cinema. It has not much about developing the idea of Great Russia with a highest world mission. There are hardly more Slavophile motives here than Westernisers' ones. The new historical movies shot mainly by the Russian state or Church request construct a parable about a great supranational historical empire, which unites all ethnic groups, peoples, and religions under the rule of the Russian Tsar/Emperor/Patriarch. For Soviet times, the Communist Party or its leader usually plays the role of the monarch, while the role of civil religion can be played by political ideology. The modern Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church disseminates the idea of imperialism as a basis of the Orthodox media cinematographic preaching. This type of preaching, along with Christian preaching on the Internet, social networks, and video games, has become increasingly used by Orthodox clergymen and church organisations. Here Russian Orthodox Church follows the Roman Catholics and Protestants, who currently use media sermon as an important part of their homiletics. From priests to clergy of the highest rank, such as Metropolitan Hilarion (Alfeev) of Volokolamsk or Metropolitan Tikhon (Shevkunov) of Pskov and Porkhovsk, more and more men of cloth begin to attract audience by their performance in offline and online video blogs, by online streams of their sermons in the digital space and finally, by shooting films, both documentaries and feature films. The main components of the neo-imperial narrative in the modern ideologised cinematographic preaching are the following: 1) constructing the parable of the great supranational historical empire (pre-Mongol Rus, Horde, Russian Principality, Russian Tsardom, Russian Empire, finally, the Soviet Union); 2) emphasising the great role of political leader, prince/tsar/emperor/general secretary/president; 3) resorting to preposterous synthesis of incompatible ideals of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union; 4) spreading anti-historicism, anachronism, including linguistic, substituting historical fantasy for the history of the Russian Orthodox Church; 5) elevating the current national ideology to the status of national archetype, with searching and successful finding of "eternal" geopolitical enemies and friends of Russia; 6) re-considering Orthodoxy as a glamour "export product" for the West. The Cinematographic Orthodoxy depicted in imperial propaganda films has little in common with the history of the Russian Orthodox Church and the ideal of Orthodox Christian morality. Under the pen of scriptwriters and film directors who create their mass products by the order of the current Russian state or Patriarchate, Orthodox Christianity becomes a social and media construct that must exists solely for the blessing and support of the state power, as well as for the entertainment of the mass audience. Therefore, we must stress that such a preaching does not achieve its goals, as it does not preach Jesus Christ's teaching, spirituality and a way for soul salvation and improvement.

AB The subject of the article is information and communication aspects of the socio-political processes of our time, which in general can be characterized as related to the phenomenon and concept of the nation. The close relationship between modernization in a broad sense, the development of a more or less unified information space and nation-building processes was noted and analyzed back in the 1980s. in the works of representatives of the constructivist trend in sociology and historical science (E. Gellner, B. Anderson, E. Hobsbawm, etc.). It seems that at present there are many grounds for "rechecking" this theory in relation to the current state of mass communications in multicultural societies, including post-Soviet ones. It is suggested that in the current state of the infosphere, the traditional mechanisms of mass information that contributed to the policy of nation states are currently competing, and not always successfully, with the network communities of "national citizenship". Conclusions are made about how the specificity of this experience influences the formation of national identity, discourse of the nation, as well as images of historical memory.

AB To predict the forms and level of political activity of young people in modern Russia, the authors analyze their assessments of the current interaction of the state with young people and their ideas about ways and methods of optimizing the state youth policy. The Strauss-Howe generational theory and the two-step flow of communication model by P. Lazarsfeld, B. Berelson, and H. Gaudet are the basic methodology of the research. The empirical basis of the article is comprised of data from mass surveys conducted in the fall of 2020. The information was collected using the questionnaire method (the sample included 2,500 pupils of grades 8-11 in schools and first- and second-year university students in seven regions of the Siberian Federal District and four regions of the Far East). Cross-territorial comparison facilitated the estimation of the degree to which assessments and ideas of young people about the state youth policy have become universal. To implement the tasks set, the authors estimated current assessments of the state youth policy of the Russian Federation by the young people of the Siberian Federal District, as well as their awareness of the implemented youth programs and projects, and their ideas about the desired forms and types of state support for young people. Groups of subjects that influence the respondents in their assessment of this policy domain have also been identified. The conducted analysis has revealed a low level of young people's awareness of the state youth policy and its assessment as ineffective. The inability of the respondents to distinguish between state-supported and non-state programs and projects has turned out to be a characteristic feature. The demand of young people for state support of education and healthcare, assistance in employment and accommodation has been traced in all the studied subjects of the federal district. It is especially high among young people who have assessed the state youth policy as ineffective and who do not have sufficient information about it. Pupils and students have stated the creation of career growth environment, the financing of organizations working with young people, and the development of youth self-government as desirable forms of state support. At the same time, information support of young people has proved to be less relevant. The study has shown that, despite the specifics of the communication links of the younger generation, parents are still opinion leaders for them. Teachers, the media, and other traditional channels of government influence on young people are losing their relevance. The authors have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to move from the legal and regulatory state youth policy to a diversified one, which will consider the specific features of the communication channels of the "Born Digital" generation and their preferred formats of interaction with the state.

AB The digitalization processes of modern society are carried out at lightning speed, affecting all spheres of life. There is a change in the social structure of society; the problem of the digital divide is becoming more acute. Under these conditions, social groups and individuals are forced to adapt to the new social reality in a fairly limited time. The article aims to provide an analytical review of the current main directions and concepts of older people's social adaptation in the context of digitalization of modern society, and to determine the role of ICT in solving the problems of older people's social adaptation and integration. The article presents: (1) an analytical review of sociological concepts of social adaptation, the impact of social changes on adaptive behavior, models of social adaptation, types of social inequality, including the digital divide, and ways to overcome it; (2) secondary analysis of the results of sociological studies of older people's social adaptation and adaptation resources in the context of digitalization of Russian society; (3) promising directions for future research. The problem of the research is that, in the conditions of digitalization of modern Russian society, a situation has developed when only a small part of the elderly are able to successfully adapt to the new social reality, which leads to the social exclusion of this social group. That is why the problem field of the research was formed within the framework of the analysis of older people's social adaptation in the conditions of modern society's digitalization and the digital divide, and the analysis of the role of ICT in solving the problems of older people's social adaptation and integration. The authors conclude that modern Russian society is experiencing digital inequality caused by both objective (formed by the social environment: the accessibility of ICT tools) and subjective (depending on the individual: motivation to use and master ICT, digital competence) parameters. Digital inequality is a factor in the transformation of older people's social behavior. The authors emphasize that older people's integration into modern society and social adaptation to it are possible through the use of such an adaptation resource as ICT. The knowledge and intensity of use of ICT by the elderly are indicators of older people's social adaptability in the information society.

AB In this article, the author proceeds from the conceptual reversal of cultural-historical epistemology to the personal, historical, and social experience of a representative of an intellectual culture (scientist, philosopher) and his understanding and rethinking of his methodological attitudes. The idea of the article is that cultural-historical epistemology makes it possible to present natural-scientific and philosophical individual reflection as a specific component of the development of special tools, which are capable of recording and assessing the methodological effectiveness of research activities taking into account individual cognitive experience. For this purpose, the author turns to the issue of an autobiographical narrative - a narrative containing the personal experience of working scientists rethinking their own methodological attitudes. The specific character of ego-documents, and moreover, ego-texts of a natural scientific kind in this case is corroborated by the ideas of cultural-historical epistemology. A scientist is turned to Other, whether in himself or in the narrative. Here scientific methodology and autobiographical narrative are conceptually mixed. As the main material reveals the meaning of the above idea, ego-texts by A.A. Ukhtomsky (his notes in notebooks, correspondence, and memoirs) were selected. While comprehending the fate of domestic and foreign science and also perfectly imagining the further development of multiple "systems of knowledge", Ukhtomsky still saw a living person - the Interlocutor - behind this process. The need to preserve this image in front of oneself, to preserve the Dominant on the face of Other, this internal orientation, are brought by Ukhtomsky to a conceptually higher level. In this case, the narrative is viewed as a type of reflection that allows one to explicate and give a personal assessment of the effectiveness of the methodological guidelines, based on which the scientist chooses certain areas of research.

AB The objective of the study is to enquire into cultural and civilizational specifics of patriotism in the scope of Western and Russian models of statehood, an overview of which is provided in order to analyze the way they influence different perceptions of citizenship, civil society, and its interactions with the state as a political institution. The research's methodological framework is composed of interdisciplinary and civilizational approaches that allow exploring the complex nature and sociocultural specifics of patriotism, reflecting the direction in which Russian and Western European nationhoods have been developing. The use of logical, systematic, and comparative research methods as well as complex analysis permits a deeper understanding of patriotism in its intricate, multifaceted core. The authors conclude that a variety of connotations determines perception and interpretation of patriotism in the West and in Russia, the main reason being fundamental differences in cultural and political traditions alike.

DT Article
DE Francis Bacon; experts; science and power; nature; contemporaneity
ID SCIENCE; SCIENTISTS
AB F. Bacon in his work New Organon proposes a project of a new science, which ensures the desire of human race "to recover its right over nature". The article examines the work on the universal owner of "the right over nature" in two historical contexts. The first context determines the emergence of modern science. Here Bacon plays the role of an expert mediator who introduces the new scientific method in its broader social meaning. His work on the universal owner of "the right over nature" combines and intersects the cognitive and political aspects of scientific endeavor. The second context covers the present situation after the Scientific-Technical Revolution, when the use of the "right over nature" becomes actual, and not only possible. The contradictions revealed in the first context in the activities of the expert mediator serve as the basis for analyzing the present situation of interaction between science and society. The author describes the expert mediator, corresponding to the modern context of uncertainty and conflict of values, through the concept of "honest broker of policy alternatives" by R. Pielke, as well as through the palette of expert knowledge types presented by the STS researchers. She shows why the presented differentiation of expert knowledge types is not enough to organize the work of an expert mediator as an "honest broker". In conclusion, she puts forward the hypothesis about distributed expertise, which can represent contemporary work on the owner of the "right over nature" and describes some aspects of this work. The author associates the significance of the hypothesis of distributed expertise with the preservation of the openness of the project of Bacon's new science.

AB The authors point out the main challenges faced by the Central European countries in the last two years and analyze the measures taken by the governments of the Visegrad countries - individually and jointly - in an effort to overcome the negative consequences of the pandemic and to give a new impetus to the development of societies in social, political and economic spheres. The pandemic in 2020/2021 can be considered as a milestone in the history of effectiveness of political and economic systems established over three decades in these countries. The authors explore only some, but decisive measures, such as internal political stabilization, social and economic instrument to help the population. Analyzing the main alarming points of Central European countries, the authors come to a conclusion that the democratic parliamentary system established in these states during the years of reforms, based on a network of non-governmental organizations, plays a significant positive role. Manifestations of independence take place against the backdrop of delays of decision-making in Brussels and underscore the peculiarities of national and regional development.

AB The article discusses some aspects of A.C. Lappo-Danilovsky's work, embodied in his two main papers - "History Methodology" and "The history of political ideas in Russia in the 18th century in connection with the general course of its culture and politics" from the social mentalities perspective. The correspondence between the ideas of Lappo-Danilevsky and the concept of "mentality" is revealed. There are shown some contradictions of Lappo-Danilevsky's research attitudes, namely, the thesis about the integral (collective) subject as the "main object of historical science" and the focus on specific historical personalities and their ideas; the understanding of the importance of studying the peculiarities of the national mentality and the predominant attention to borrowed Intellectual products". These contradictions should be seen as a reflection of the specific state of the spiritual sphere of Russian society, which is characterized by a weak coupling of mental-psychological layers and registers, which requires study both in content, concrete-historical, and methodological terms, including the development of an appropriate conceptual framework.

   effective number of parties
AB The elections to the legislative assemblies of the Russian regions, held in 2019-2020, did not become a turning point in the development of the Russian political system. However, the results of these elections demonstrate a well-defined vector in the dynamics of regional party systems. The data of the study strongly indicate that in the regions of Russia there is a gradual increase in the level of political pluralism. Despite changes in electoral legislation and the efforts of the regional authorities, the effectiveness of participation in the elections of the parliamentary opposition and nonparliamentary parties is growing. Although the number of parties that put forward lists in regional elections is decreasing, and election commissions register not all party lists, the share of votes that go to the opposition is increasing. Reducing the activity of some parties and not allowing others to participate in the election campaign no longer guarantees the victory of the " party of power'. In the context of the growing protest activity, the reduction in the number of election participants is one of the factors in the consolidation of the opposition increasing its effectiveness. Therefore, the factional composition of the legislative assemblies of the regions, which are less and less similar to the four-party State Duma, is expanding. So far, the effect of the " fabricated majority" still allows United Russia to maintain leadership in almost all regional parliaments. However, the increase in the effective number of electoral and parliamentary parties in practice in all regions over the past years convincingly confirms the tendency to increase the level of inter-party competition. The index of the average effective number of parties developed by the author allows comparing between regions and relatively accurately determining the place of each of them in the overall rating. Although most of the regions where legislative elections were held in 2019-2020 are difficult to classify as competitive, the value of the index of the effective number of parties has increased even in them. Moreover, a number of regions, following the results of these elections, showed a noticeable increase and a high level of the value of this index by Russian standards. All this suggests that the diversity of regional party systems in Russia is growing, and this trend requires the attention of researchers.

AB The article is dedicated to the 110th anniversary of B. Kreisky (1911 - 1990), a prominent statesman of post-war Austria, one of the leaders of international social democracy. From 1959 to 1966 he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Austria. In 1970. 1983 he was in charge of the Government of that State. In 1976 - 1989, he was Vice-President of the Socialist International. Soviet issues were not only an integral part of his political interests, but also a topic of constant dialogue within the European establishment, an important subject of meetings with the leaders of the USSR. Being a critic of many aspects of the USSR's foreign and domestic policy, not accepting the communist interpretation of Marxism, he did not consider ideological contradictions an obstacle to contacts with the Soviet leadership on a wide range of international issues. The dialogue with the USSR touched upon the topics of European and international detente, events in the Middle East and various situations in the countries of the "Third World".

DE Tektology; Alexander Bogdanov; history of Russian philosophy; scientific
   monism; scientism; Institute of the Scientific Philosophy
AB The author considers the activity of Alexander A. Bogdanov as a full member of the Institute of Scientific Philosophy, established in 1921. Special attention is paid to the line of radical denial of the actual meaning of philosophy, what was characteristic for Bogdanov's works of those years. This topic was manifested in the article "From Religious Monism to Scientific One", which was read at the Institute in February 1923 as Bogdanov's scientific report. Presenting the development of human knowledge as a change of historical forms of monism based on the evolution of labor practice and the inherent desire to coordinate cognitive activity, Bogdanov proclaimed the advent of the era of scientific monism and presented his own "universal organization science" as a means of the future real unity of collective experience. The political campaign against Bogdanov conducted throughout the 1920s also affected his activities at the Institute of Scientific Philosophy: the thinker was removed from the staff, and the possibilities of his philosophical work had been narrowing more and more every year. However, despite the pressure Bogdanov continued to work at the Institute, taking part, in particular, in the heated discussions around Spinoza and Bergson's philosophies, which marked the beginning of a new round of polemics among "mechanists" and "dialectics". The most important research interests of Bogdanov in the last years of his life were also philosophical problems of biology, the foundations of natural science knowledge, the methodological basis of the theory of relativity. Thus, the scientific activity of A.A. Bogdanov as a full member of the Institute reflected almost all the philosophical topics and problems that were significant for him at that time.

AB The crisis in relations between Russia and the West has challenged not only Russia's foreign policy but also the theories which explain Russia's role in world politics. Historically, these theories have also pointed to the optimum political course for Moscow. Alexander Dugin's geopolitics occupy a special place among those theories. Dugin is not recognized in academic circles in Russia, but in the West, Dugin is seen if not as a surrogate propounding the Kremlin's views then as a rather influential political philosopher. His works are considered an important source of contemporary Russian foreign policy thought, and are used to explain Russian foreign policy. As a consequence, it is well worth assessing the degree to which Dugin's approaches - and also the views of researchers who evaluate Russia's foreign policy using his approach - have borne themselves out during this current crisis. In this paper, Dugin's theory is tested by juxtaposing it against that of Vadim Tsymbursky, another geopolitical thinker well known in Russia but not in the West. Tsymbyrsky's works were chosen because he has developed an original and holistic theory which explains the place Russia occupies in the world. The theory was built within the same geopolitical paradigm as Dugin's, but contradicts the latter both with its point of departure and conclusions. Both Dugin's and Tsymbursky's theories are compared to the influential American realist Stephen Walt's theory of the balance of threats. Western scholars pay particular attention to Dugin's work, which holds Western academics back from developing a nuanced understanding of Russian domestic issues, the complexities thereof, and Russia's place in the world. Furthermore, this hinders proper understanding of Russia's foreign policy strategy. Russia's behavior in the current crisis was more accurately predicted by Tsymbursky's theory than by Dugin's. The conclusions made regarding structural geographical factors in Russian's foreign policy course - which are drawn according to Tsymbursky's theory - indicate parallels with those which can be made on the basis of the balance of threats theory. As a paradigm, Russian geopolitics maintains its analytical potential, though it could be strengthened by a more thorough analysis of the current shifts in the international order.

AB Introduction. In the 1960s, the formation of a consumer society began in the USSR. At the same time, the differences in living standard and quality of life between the segments of the population became more and more noticeable. These phenomena were in conflict with the Soviet ideology - the basis of the political system of the USSR. However, the problem of the consumer society formation in the USSR and the associated challenges to the Soviet system have not yet been sufficiently studied in historiography. Methods and materials. The methodological background of the research is based on the principles of scientific objectivity and historicism, as well as the general scientific and special methods typical for historical research. The research base includes both published and unpublished documents found by the author in the Russian State Archive of Contemporary History, the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History and the Central State Archive of the City of Moscow. Analysis. The Soviet power tried to respond to the challenges of consumer society within the framework of the new political and ideological concept of Developed Socialism. One of the tasks of the country's development at this stage was declared to be the achievement of a high standard of living in the country, as well as the widespread introduction of a system of material incentives. This policy has had a certain effect. However, the previous challenges for the Soviet system remained, and new problems arose. The wage growth outstripped the growth of labor productivity, and the commodity deficit became one of the main reasons for the decline in the effectiveness of the material incentive system. To solve the problems listed above, the authorities introduced innovations in policy: reducing the rate of income growth and the population's desire to consume, increasing the role of moral incentives, fighting surplus money, and pursuing people for non-labor income. These innovations were in conflict with the policy aimed at increasing the welfare of the population. Results. Thus, the response of Soviet ideology to the challenges of the consumer society was to implement mutually exclusive measures. First, the authorities, while officially promoting a policy of increasing living standards, in practice sought to limit the growth of consumption. Second, material incentives to work and the rejection of equalization were introduced simultaneously with the censure of enrichment. In addition, the authorities failed to eradicate the negative manifestations of the consumer society for the Soviet ideology. In general, the inability of Soviet ideology to provide an adequate response to the challenges of consumer society was one of the manifestations of the ideological impasse in which the country was during the period under review. Problems related to the standard of living of the population became one of the time mines that undermined the Soviet system and led to its collapse.

DT Article
DE ethical expertise; humanitarian expertise; human; notion of a human;
   human boundaries; institutional form
AB This article analyses the fluidity of a human condition in terms of ethical boundaries. Recent technological developments have made the ethical framework of the notion of a human volatile and prone to revaluation. This revaluation requires established practices of conduct and interpretation of an ethical expertise. The article describes such new forms and ways to make them part of the repertoire of established institutions. In addition, the article differentiates the specifics of an ethical expertise and a humanitarian one. The former is focused on protecting the human condition from technologically-borne distortions and on making such protection a part of political and social institutions. The latter, in turn, is designed for the purposes of social engineering. It is supposed to help in the development of new social contexts, including ones that merge humanity with the results of high-tech endeavours. An ethical expertise is more focused on preserving the status quo. A humanitarian expertise is proactive and based on non-linear social foresights. The authors believe the reactionary nature of an ethical expertise to be the result of widespread shifts in the established definition of a human. This can be easily illustrated in such fields as biomedicine and gene research. Namely gene editing and major organ transplants can blur the line between human and non-human entities. The article points out an ongoing deficiency, on a methodological and conceptual level, when it comes to a humanitarian expertise. Furthermore, the article contains the groundwork for articulation of a humanitarian expertise. This form of expertise is unique due to its institutional nature and inclusion of the role of "researcher-participant," which an expert is supposed to play. While elaborating on the differences between a humanitarian and an ethical expertise, it is noted that an ethical expertise aims at preserving the existing norms and boundaries of the notion of a human, outlined in treatise and conventions, while a humanitarian expertise strives to recreate the norm of a human in accordance with its new state - as a fluid and dynamic category

AB Information about the mysterious supernatural water creature "xullyukun" is summarized in the article. It is emphasized that it takes its place in the pantheon of deities among the Yakuts (Sakha) - one of the indigenous peoples in the North-East of the Russian Federation. It is noted that Russian and foreign travelers, political exiles, and research scientists wrote about the traditions, life and religion of the Yakuts (Sakha) at different times. The descriptions of the beliefs of the Yakuts (Sakha) are given, in which there are references to the water creatures "xullyukuns". The author has reviewed the literature where the "xullyukuns" are mentioned. The version proposed by scientists is analyzed, that "xullyukun" is a blending of the ancient spirit-master of water and an evil demon, which became possible due to the fact that this image correlated with the idea of the migration of aquatic animals from water to land and back. The author of the article is critical of such judgments. The data collected by the author of the article during numerous expeditions to the north-east of Yakutia, where the old image of the creature of the pre-Christian period has been preserved, is presented. On the basis of research, the author comes to the conclusion that the image of "xullyukun" is incomparable with the devil. It has been proved that "xullyukun", according to ancient beliefs, is a creature the arbiter of human destinies, and the new image is associated with Christmas divination, where the influence of Christianity is seen. The author of the article shares the original sources. Information collected in the field during conversations with informants is introduced into scientific circulation.

AB In modern conditions, the global problems facing humanity have moved from the space of theoretical discussions to the space of practical issues that require immediate solutions at the level of individual countries and the world community as a whole. These changes are associated with a new technological revolution in social production, which is being discussed today not only by theoretical scientists, but also by chief business practitioners and political leaders of the most influential countries of the world. Fundamental alterations are also taking place in the social stratification of society. The article discusses the theory, which can explain the social system arising in the course of these transformations - Noonomy conception, created by Sergey D. Bodrunov. An analysis of its constituents is presented, as well as contingent ways to attain this state of social system, including formation of the second-generation New Industrial Society (NIS.2), socialization of the social life, the new industrialization, based on the integration of science, education and manufacture. Reflecting on Bodrunov's works, author gives an account of his own thoughts about possible future scenarios, with challenges, that may appear before mankind in close perspective, among those. The paper is a proposal to discuss problems concerned with global transformation of modern society, which were emphasized by the Noonomy theory creator.

AB The role of digital platforms as intermediaries in the interaction of citizens and political institutions is investigated. The aim of the study is to identify the relationship between the ecology of the use of platforms, the activity of their use and the trust in political institutions. The testing of hypotheses is based on the data of a field study in 2019 a survey of 1200 citizens in the 10 most developed regions of Russia in terms of the use of digital public services. It was revealed that the use of platforms and trust in institutions are mainly influenced by three factors efficiency, safety and affordance. The use of platforms is determined to a greater extent by affordance than efficiency and security, then the trust in institutions is more influenced by efficiency and security. At the same time, the actual technical parameters of use, expressed in the affordances, have an impact only in the early stages of interaction, yielding in the future to efficiency and safety.

AB The article is focused on the emergence of modern nationalism in the first half of the 19th century and patriotism as form of its' manifestation under influence of the French revolution of the end of the 18th century. While in the West the political nationalism emerged that sought independence of peoples and civil rights, in Russia cultural nationalism appeared in an assimilative model of national system, which in fact was present in all ideological movements including the Decembrists. Civil patriotism was alien to most Russian authors; even liberal thinkers regarded it as innate feeling. The question about specific features of Russian national consciousness in comparison with Westerners became the main point of patriotic worldview. At the same time degree of alienation between Russia and the West was understood in different ways, from mild confrontation to absolute rejection of Western values and foundations. Is there really a complex of being "incomplete European" in Russian consciousness? The wars against Napoleonic France, especially that of 1812, constituted a starting point in emergence of patriotic worldview, in contrast to elite of the previous epoch. By the beginning of 1830s' two models of Russian patriotism came into being, the state model represented in theory of official narodnost, and liberal model expressed in the views of Slavophiles and Westernizers. The problems that constituted the core of Russian patriotism had been formulated at that time.

AB Introduction. The overview's subject is the problem of Latin Americans' situation (citizens and noncitizens of the USA) during the D. Trump's presidency, reflected in new works by American authors. The historiography overview consist of researchers' monographs from American universities and analytical articles from academic journals and periodicals. The overview's logical systematization is based on two principles: the established chronological framework and the grouping of author's views on a particular problem. Relevance. The overview topic's relevance is caused by significant reduction in the rights and increased prosecution of Latinos in the contemporary of the United States which is emphasized by the American authors themselves. The authors emphasized the theoretical basis for the new migration political process was making D. Trump's conservative nationalist policy which is called "America First". The implementation of such policy leads to new challenges in ensuring national security, exacerbating social conflicts and splitting the American society. Purpose. The work's purpose is to highlight new trends in the US immigration policy that significantly restricted the rights and freedoms of Latin American citizens and Latin American refugees living in the country during this period. Methods. The author of the article used the following methodological tools: the scientific principle of objectivity, which allowed us to assess the degree of subjective information contained in the publications; the ontological (substantive) approach, which was used to clarify the actors of conflict interaction in the process of the White House's transformational policy presented in new American studies; the institutional method based on the research works, which allowed us to determine changes in the functions and activities of the US government's departments when dealing with immigration issues and the situation of Latin American citizens and non-citizens in the United States during the D. Trump's presidency. Results. The results consist in the recognition of the nativist and conservative nationalist policy of the US government towards Latin Americans by the American academic and expert community, which contradicts the values declared by the American society and contributes to its separation and division creating greater inequality within it. Although the historiography overview did not aim to examine Latinos' situation in the United States in historical retrospect. All of these could be noted in the above works that no American author noted an improvement in the situation of Latinos during D. Trump's presidency, compared to the previous administrations of B. Clinton, G.W. Bush and B. Obama. Many authors noted that new problems have been added to the old problems of Latinos and incoming immigrants. The results area. The results obtained can be used by Russian Americanist researchers to conduct their further researches in the fields of area studies, international relations, international processes, and the history of foreign countries. Conclusion. The Latinos' situation analysis in the United States during the D. Trump's presidency was based on American authors' publications for 2018-2020, which suggests not only the devastating impact of the White House's transformative policies toward Latinos, but also the changing structure of American society itself, which is inherently immigrant.

DE skepticism; virtual reality; epistemology; hinge proposition;
   epistemological disjunctivism; biscopic theory
AB The author considers Duncan Pritchard's modern biscopic approach to the skeptical problem of the existence of the external world based on epistemological disjunctivism and the hinge epistemology of the late philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Epistemological disjunctivism asserts that, for paradigmatic cases of perceptual knowledge, the subject has knowledge due to the presence of factual rational grounds. The hinge epistemology of the late Wittgenstein philosophy asserts the presence of the most reliable beliefs (hinge propositions) which cannot have a basis but are assumed by the logic of the rationality of the subject and are simply accepted. Pritchard's reasoning comes to the conclusion that the skeptical scenario is inherently illegitimate because all knowledge is ultimately based on certain concepts (hinge propositions) which are rooted in reality. The matrix hypothesis of computer simulation by David Chalmers is explicated: the subject always has a cognitive system that receives input data and sends output data to an artificially created computer simulation of the world. This hypothesis is presented within the framework of the position of virtual realism, which tries to dissolve the skeptical problem by claiming that virtual/simulated reality is as real as the actual world. An attempt is made to apply Pritchard's biscopic approach to Chalmers' hypothesis in order to find more solid grounds for dissolving the skeptical problem. The author comes to the conclusion that Pritchard's approach can be considered as effective only within the framework of a coherence theory of truth, otherwise the rational grounds of the subject cannot be considered factual. Pritchard's biscopic approach works when we consider basic hinge propositions as underlying the simulation, and all the knowledge, opinions, beliefs of the subject inside the simulation will be limited only to the subject's simulated world. From the point of view of the correspondence theory of truth, real objects are inaccessible to the subject's perception within the simulation, and beliefs cannot be verified with the real state of affairs. Thus, Chalmers' claim that his matrix/metaphysical hypothesis is not skeptical is still weak.

   JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA Russian
DT Article
DE labor; liberation; nature; capitalism; plasticity; Malabou; Bennett;
   materiality
AB In the article, labor under capitalism is understood as a dehumanizing ideology that turns a person only into a worker. This becomes possible through the alienation of man from nature and corporeality. The connection with nature is blocked through the seizure of land, through the scrapping of the usual way of life, the rejection of traditional occupations through "deprivation of shelters" (Anna Tsing) - this is how peasants turn into the proletariat, this is how compulsion to work is created. Corporeality is blocked and repressed, since man is reduced within capitalism only to their labor avatar. The life of a person outside of work turns out to be invisible, thus a person becomes a partial, incomplete subject. Emotional breakdown occurs, depressive states appear - a person, according to Franco "Bifo" Berardi, "deerotizes". This is how work eats up a part of life. According to Mark Fisher, the reason for all this turns out to be the totality of the capitalist project, the global atmosphere of "capitalist realism", blocking any other possibility of existence. Within this totality, the subject is not only exploited, but also self-exploited, since they are completely immersed in ideology and cannot overestimate oneself. Thus, labor is psychoanalytically associated with the self-sacrifice for the Super-Ego, with self-devaluation and self-splitting, with inclusion in the symbolic order. The possibility of liberation from the totality of capitalist ideology is considered in the article in the context of the texts of new materialism - these are the versions of Catherine Malabou and Jane Bennett. For example, Malabou speaks about neural liberation, where the bet is placed on the ambivalent plasticity of the brain. Bennett defends the project of vitalistic materialism, where she rehabilitates the materiality of the world, "vibrant matter". Moreover, for Bennett, it is fundamental to reject anthropocentrism, which blocks ties with nature and the world as a whole. These versions of materialism seem to be productive for the return of an ideologically devalued part of oneself to a person, for the return of their integrity and restoration of their connection with nature. So, corporeality and materiality turn out to be a resource for eliminating ideological distortion.

AB This article examines two related texts - Journey to Paris in 1698 by Martin Lister, an English physician and scholar and member of the Royal Society of London, based on personal observations during his travels, and a satire on this work, Journey to London in 1698 by the lawyer, poet and satirist William King. An analysis of these writings shows how the application of the idea of the scholar, whose observations should not be influenced by existing authoritative opinions and who should not succumb to paying attention only to what catches his eye, towards the study of the city becomes for Lister an instrument for the criticism of the authoritarian power of the French king Louis XIV. King's satire, on the other hand, shows that observation without reference to authoritative opinion fails to distinguish the significant from the inconsequential, which deprives the city's image of its most important characteristic: its status as the capital and centre of power. He uses this thesis as an instrument to criticize the new model of knowledge and science promoted by the Royal Society of London. In both cases, the independence of the scholarobserver's view and the tendency to refuse recognition of authoritative judgments inevitably correlate with a failure to recognise the authority of existing political power.

AB Education is a rather conservative public institution; however, the challenges of the time require a revision of the concept of the subject of education. The article reflects on the problem of transformation of the subject of education. The technogenic civilization leads to the erosion of the individual, subjective principle, and this clearly shows in the history of philosophical thought. The culture of the information society, the essential sign of which will be technical power and the driving force will be information, manifests itself through the formation of a linguistic information culture. The leisurely world with the culture of the word confronts the dynamic and diverse world of information. The history of pedagogy and education represents the tradition of understanding human education as a person's ascent to their essential principle, as their immersion in the world of culture. The ancient Greek concept of paideia is considered as a person's education and upbringing realized through a person's mastering culture, virtue and universal knowledge. There is a line to humanitas from paideia, humanism is understood as the cultivation of humanity, our appeal from the today's world to the ancient world with the advancement of paideia. Attention is focused on the understanding of education through an appeal to a person in their integrity, as opposed to the understanding of education as a technology for transferring knowledge and competencies. The concepts of education as an individual's elevation to the universal are analyzed. Attention is also focused on the impossibility of education outside of culture, education is seen as a way to master culture. Forming oneself, a person not only copies the given cultural patterns, carries out the translation of cultural experience, but also builds new structures. Through education, a person moves towards the disclosure of their true "Self". Education, understood as an ongoing process, helps isolate a person's uniqueness. The inexhaustibility of the educational process implies the constant presence of a person in the status of the subject of education. The author studies the understanding of the subject of education through the prism of the concept of self-care as a general attitude towards oneself and as a set of practices. Caring for oneself is not understood as an abstract principle, but as an urgent need of a person, which finds its expression in the practice of working on oneself, changing oneself. It is concluded that a person cannot do without taking care of oneself, as they are endowed with consciousness and reflection. To take care of oneself means to take care of one's education and self-education, self-transformation, a person forms oneself as a subject of education, builds oneself up as a person.

DE Communicative-cultural memory; discursive identity; intercultural
   sensitivity; media- communications; Russians
AB The work is devoted to the influence of intercultural sensitivity and communicative-cultural memory on the development of media communications and involves identification of a repertoire of identifications, building Russians' discursive identity in the English-language media space. In this study, communities are representatives of the institutional environment - official media journalists and non-institutional environments - bloggers and writers. The stories' analysis results show that Russian and non-Russian communicators use similar facts in stories about Russians, but appraisal positions are often the opposite. In Russian journalists' discourse, one can see a characteristic feature of Russians, which probably does not fit into the framework of thought of the rest of communicators - a manifestation of the Russian duality "in almost all aspects of behavior." Non-Russian cultures representatives mostly broadcast the presumption of a negative assessment. We believe that such dissimilarity in the construction of identity reflects the insufficient level of intercultural sensitivity and the previously formed cultural and historical memory and is explained by an attempt to apply the experience of the cultural memory, the "recreated past" to the interpretation of the "other". These differences are now being used by political actors to support specially organized "informational confrontations" and popularize "threats". Since all communicators belong to "hot" societies (according to A. Assman), this probably requires a constant search for dialogue, striving for constructive communication, development of media communications in the modem information space.

DE legislative assembly; expert community; policy decisions
AB The forms of expert participation in law preparation and other decision-making in the region legislative assembly as a whole and in its committees are analyzed on the example of the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg (SPbLA). The research was realized by means of analysis of the SPbLA website and semi-structured expert interviews with deputies and their assistants. The SPbLA website was compared with the websites of the legislative assemblies of Leningrad and Nizhny Novgorod Oblasts and of Moscow City Duma. The author has detected that, unlike the websites of the compared assemblies, the SPbLA website contains no information about activities of expert councils affiliated with SPbLA or with its committees. Expert interviews supported the absence of such expert councils, and respondents explain this by the position of the chair of SPbLA. Simultaneously, the Committee for City Management, City Construction and City Property has an interesting experience of joint activities with expert communities, including publication of all expert examination results. However, these results are publicized outside of the official SPbLA web-site. The conclusion has been made that, in the respondents' views, the expert community consists of not only expert-specialists with scientific knowledge, but also representatives of business that lobby their corporate interests. The deputies of the assembly also stress the expert knowledge of the assembly's employees that can have knowledge about the formal and non-formal rules of decision-making; they work as inner experts. Two kinds of experts can be distinguished in the community of outer experts: 1) experts invited as a resource of knowledge on a problem situation interesting for the deputies; 2) experts involved in the legislative and other decision-making in SpbLA; such experts must have knowledge about the inner procedures and practices of decision-making in a specific regional parliament.

AB In modern conditions the processes of economic globalization have necessitated the intensification of innovation processes in almost all countries of the world community in order to achieve competitive advantages in socio-economic and political development. At the same time theories of regional economics, in particular theories of "growth points" or "development kernels", regional self-development potential, territorial agglomeration, etc. are being developed and applied. The experience in the implementation of innovation strategies in recent years has shown a clear lack of administrative resources and investment injections into individual programs and centres. The innovation economy requires the formation of a development basis in the unity of productive forces and production relations. At present the processes of development of innovative economy are restrained both by the existing problems of financing of science, modernisation of scientific laboratories and institutes base, and by the problems of training of innovation-active personnel of specialists. Undoubtedly, the lag in scientific and technical support of educational process, interaction with production, availability of necessary practice base, insufficient innovative activity of business in this direction, its low financial opportunities have a negative impact. Thus, modern innovative production necessitates the expansion of integrative links between science, education and production not only in reproduction, but also in the territorial aspect. Integrated formations of science, education and production become the basis for innovation development of the economy, and their interaction goes beyond the boundaries of one administrative unit and extends to adjacent, cross-border territories. In this connection development of theory, methodology and recommendations for practice of spatial integration of science, education and production, formation of spatially localized innovative subsystems of transboundary territories on the basis of their innovation potential is an actual problem, which has not received proper attention in modern economic researches. This article deals with the issues of identifying points of growth of innovation ecosystems of the regions initiating the creation of world-class science and education centres, as well as a comparative assessment of their scientific and human resource potential competitiveness, using the data of the 2019 university performance monitoring. The data on the performance of research and education centres established in Russia in 2019 and 2020 were used as the information base for this study. A set of methods, including methods of theoretical analysis, comparison and generalization, was used to solve the research tasks. The scientific novelty and originality of the article is the proposed approach to ensuring sustainable development of the region based on the maximum involvement of growth factors of scientific and human resources potential of key actors of regional innovation systems with the use of mechanisms of scientific and educational integration in the form of science and education centres.

AB The article is a review of a documents collection "The Siberian Council Meeting of 1918: Materials" repared by the well known Omsk church historian Dmitry Vladimirovich Olikhov. It was published in Moscow in 2020. It contains an informative introductory article on the Siberian Council and publishes its documents known at present date, as well as materials from the periodicals and memoirs. The article emphasizes the relevance of the book and its scientific significance. Institutional and historical-anthropological approaches provide scientific basis to the documents collection and, accordingly, to this article devoted to its analysis. The principles of consistency and determinism have made it possible to characterize the publication, considered as a phenomenon of science with its particular structure and at the same time as a part of the historical scholarship. Due to specifics of the topic, the main scientific method used in this publication is problematic. The article contains critical remarks and considerations on the introductory article prefacing the analyzed documents collection. It offers its opinions on main initiators of the Tomsk Council and its results. The article disputes the author-compiler's point of view that the Siberian Council managed to avoid political extremes. Drawing on the analysis of documentary materials from the said collection, the author of the article claims that the Tomsk Council Meeting created conditions for consolidation of right-wing politicians and religious leaders on anti-Bolshevik platform. Despite his expressed criticism, the author of this article is of the opinion that publication of generally available materials on the Siberian Council Meeting and similar publications on the All-Ukrainian Church Council and the South-Eastern Church Council create opportunities for comparative historical analyses of these church forums. In conclusion the article expresses hope that the established source base should allow us to expect an appearance of new articles and monographs on the development of the conciliar principle in the Russian Orthodox Church during the Civil War in Russia.

DT Article
DE history textbook; the 2000s; reforms; historical memory policy
AB The article analyzes how the problems of Russian history of the 21st century are presented in modern school textbooks on the history of Russia. The relevance of the studied problem is determined primarily by the importance of history textbooks for constructing memory policies. At the same time, attention is paid to insufficient coverage of the 2000s transformations in modern historiography. The representation of the last twenty years in Russian history textbooks is analyzed in comparison with expert assessments of economists, sociologists, and political scientists. The authors conclude that Russian history of the 21st century appears on the pages of officially approved textbooks as a consistent, ongoing process of the development of a state that is gaining power. The textbooks contain very similar interpretations of the last two decades compared to the history of the 1990s, where one can find different interpretations of events made by the same authors. In addition, in textbooks one can find a lot of borrowings from official and propaganda rhetoric. In relation to the events of the 1990s and earlier, the authors of the textbooks under study selected alternative points of view, and subsequent events are assessed by them unambiguously. It can be stated that in the studied textbooks, the history of the last twenty years reflects the goals of historical science only to a small extent. It corresponds to the goals of historical policy to a greater extent. This conclusion becomes more obvious in the framework of the studies of Russian scholars, which, regardless of their views, cannot be described as an apology for the actions of political leaders.

DT Article
DE historical responsibility; memory of past; principle of dignity; respect
   for dignity; moral obligations
AB The article analyzes the links between the idea of historical responsibility and the general moral principle. It is argued that the search for such a general moral principle is the relevant basis for interpreting the idea of responsibility. The article aims to determine the possible content of this principle. For this, the idea of responsibility is analyzed. It is shown that responsibility should be understood not as a consequence after an expected or required action, but as a structural element of the requirement itself. It is noted that the actualization of the idea of responsibility is linked with the transition from the dominance of theories of virtue to deontological theories and the formation of the concept of the individual during the Enlightenment. It is emphasized that the thesis of moral responsibility presupposes both the existence of appropriate principles or situations, recognized as moral, and the application of appropriate sanctions. It is argued that the implementation of this thesis is guaranteed by the application of a general moral principle. The modern approaches to the search for such a principle are considered, namely the widespread statement about the preference of coherentism rather than deductivism. The basic requirement of coherentism that moral judgments should mutually support each other is analyzed. It is argued that the most acceptable way to implement this approach is not the heterogeneity of moral judgments, but their submission to a general principle. It is argued that the principle should be considered as preferred if a) it can sum up other principles that claim the status of a general principle; b) it opens up broader prospects in the search for specific diverse norms, under which various situations can be summed up. The thesis is formulated that the Kantian idea of dignity most corresponds to these requirements. These ideas were applied to the interpretation of historical responsibility. It is proposed to interpret historical responsibility as responsibility for preserving knowledge (memory) about the past. The connection of this interpretation with modern concepts of temporality, which asserts the heterogeneity and multidirectionality of time lines, is shown. It is emphasized that the use of Kantian interpretations of dignity and respect provides a search criterion for a moral attitude to the past and allows creating an appropriate framework for the interpretation of certain segments of the past. It is proposed to interpret the past as a tragic experience. It is argued that this interpretation of knowledge about the past makes it possible to give the idea of historical responsibility a universally significant meaning and become the basis for intercultural dialogue. It is shown that historical responsibility can be interpreted as a necessary means of achieving mutual respect, especially in the public sphere.

AB The article is studying foreign approaches to the interpretation and realization of international humanitarian cooperation. Humanitarian cooperation is becoming one of the effective mechanisms of foreign policy influence. Its interpretation itself sounds differently in Russian and foreign research. At the beginning of the article. the author considers the methodological foundations of the study, namely, based on academic publications of foreign researchers involved in the development of the concept of humanitarian/cultural cooperation. a brief description of humanitarian cooperation is given, with its definition and transformation of the meaning of the term. Further, the author identifies the following approaches to the definition and realization of humanitarian cooperation in foreign political and diplomatic practice: universal, regional, statist. Based on the analysis of documents of international organizations (UNESCO, Council of Europe, European Union. ASEAN, African Union, etc.), as well as of several countries (France. Italy, USA), the main approaches to the study and realization of this type of interstate interaction are highlighted. The choice of countries is determined by the fact that they possess officially published documents regarding their international humanitarian cooperation strategy. In addition, France is a "pioneer" in the formation of a united European cultural policy; 40% of UNESCO's cultural heritage sites are concentrated in Italy; the USA is a theoretical and methodological pioneer of the concept of "soft power" and public diplomacy, with which humanitarian cooperation is inextricably linked.
   The article concludes that in international discourse, humanitarian cooperation is one of the effective tools of "soft power" and includes such areas as: culture. science, education, sports, youth issues, which is more consistent with the Russian interpretation of this type of' international interaction, but at the same time, the international discourse uses the concept of "cultural cooperation" in the majority of cases to determine such interaction. In conclusion. the author's classification of foreign approaches to international humanitarian cooperation is proposed.

AB The purpose of the article is to identify current interdisciplinary scientific and practical problems in the context of the digital transformation of city administration within the emerging domain of legal science (legal urbanology). Given the complex nature of the object under study, a comprehensive study of city life requires an integrated methodological approach based on a synthesis of the findings of the legal, economic, sociological and political research factors. A significant role in the methodological provision of the study is given to the integrated approach, which allows regarding the city as a dynamically developing open social system with a complex hierarchy and developed social institutions and relationships. The city, being the most important element of the system of resettlement and human life, a key link in the formation of states, in the development of mankind in general, and scientific and technological progress in particular, now, like all other social systems, has entered the period of implementation of the smart city concept. Actual complex problems of legal regulation of the legal relations system in cities, including the social, economic, environmental aspects of their manifestation, described in the theories of various humanities in the framework of legal urbanology, are considered. On the example of the city's environmental problems, a specific complex structure of the phenomenon is shown, requiring study with the involvement of various branches of knowledge. It's concluded that the modernization of modern society and its transition to a new digital paradigm affects all social spheres, but giving the degree of concentration of economic, political, social, informational and other resources in cities, they act as an indicator of the ongoing transformation of the role of cities in the development of the country.

DE Chechen wars; veterans; memory; trauma; memory policy; oblivion
AB This article explores the traumatic memory of veterans of the Chechen wars and the ways in which this memory is dealt with by both the veterans themselves and the state. The article analyses state activities aimed at the veteran community, state narratives describing veterans and their war experiences, the veterans' own reflection on their traumatic experiences and the ways in which they choose to deal with them. Sources for the author included interviews with veterans of the First and Second wars in Chechnya, materials from a joint roundtable of veterans and researchers of the Swiss MEMCOPE project, as well as online resources created by and for veterans. The qualitative analysis of the collected materials was carried out using Atlas.ti, among other tools. The theoretical framework for the paper is based on research areas such as memory studies and trauma studies. The author concludes that veterans of the Chechen wars are now on the way to establishing their symbolic meanings and forming their own traumatic narrative. This could be a step towards transforming veterans' memories of the Chechen wars into a new cultural trauma of Russian society. But this process will be extremely difficult to implement without the involvement of the authorities and the necessary social and political resources.

DE Francois Guizot; intellectuals; the restoration of the Bourbons; July
   Monarchy; French Revolution; liberalism; orleanism
AB The purpose of the article is to analyze the role of intellectuals in the political life of France based on the study of the views and state activities of the famous French historian and political figure Francois Guizot (1787-1874). The author examines the relationship between the historical views of Guizot, his understanding of the main problems of French and European history, his public and state activities during the Restoration (1814-1830) and the July Monarchy (1830-1848). The theme of the intelligentsia in power is most vividly revealed through the personality and activities of E Guizot. He was more than just the leading politician of the July Monarchy. He enriched such fields of knowledge as history, pedagogy, constitutional law, sociology, political science. Similarly to many of his contemporaries, Guizot pursued two careers at the same time: scientific and political. However, Guizot's failure as a politician overshadowed Guizot as a scientist. The article concludes that history and politics have always been closely intertwined for Guizot. Guizot searched in the past for answers to questions pertaining to modern France. Guizot saw history as a direct continuation of politics. In doing so, Guizot took into account not only the lessons of the past. He formulated his concept of French leadership in Europe and built a theoretical framework for his foreign policy based on knowledge of history. In addition, the article concludes: turning to the historical heritage of France and Europe for Guizot was important not only from a practical point of view, but also from the point of view of morality and education. For him, the history of the development of civilization was the history of the moral improvement of mankind.

DE computation; information processing; Chinese room argument; "hard
   problem" of consciousness; double aspect principle of information
AB Since the middle of the past century, the terms "computation" and "information processing" have been central to many cognitive theories, research on computer modeling of intellectual functions, and the analytic philosophy of mind. The human mind has become more and more like a computer that receives information from the environment and uses it for management purposes, and basic mental abilities such as reasoning, decision-making, etc. like computations performed by an abstract Turing machine. The computational approach was developed by such philosophers as Hilary Putnam, Jerry Fodor, and Fred Dretske; today it plays a significant role in the works of Gualtiero Piccinini, Daniel Dennett, David Chalmers, and others. However, there is still no consensus on what physical states are the basis of computational processes, whether these processes are sufficient for the emergence of thinking, and whether it is possible to describe the nature of phenomenal conscious experiences in computational terms; accordingly, some researchers criticize this approach. The main arguments against computationalism include the triviality argument, the Goedel incompleteness argument, the Chinese room argument, and others. As a functionalist theory, computationalism is also threatened by the so-called "ontological gap" in explanation, which stands in the way of solving the "hard problem" of consciousness formulated by Chalmers. To avoid this, the Australian philosopher introduced the double aspect principle of information, according to which information in the world is represented both physically, that is, objectively and independently of the observer, and phenomenally. Of course, even when combined with the two-dimensional principle of information, computationalism will not solve all its inherent conceptual difficulties. It is likely that the answers to the above questions will soon be found in the natural sciences, among which computational ideas remain very popular.

DE Dostoevsky; existence; epistemology; ethics; aesthetics
AB The article exposes epistemological, ethical, and aesthetic foundations of Dostoevsky's existential analytics, which embodies (at least, as an ideal) the unity of good, truth, and beauty. Existential analytics is Heidegger's phenomenological project, in which the clarification of sense of human existence by means of analysis of everyday being is the main purpose. The mysteriousness of human existence is a necessary prerequisite of being-in-the-world, and this is one of the principles of existential anthropology, which aims to define man. Dostoevsky gives two definitions of man: 1) "a creature that can get accustomed to anything" (The House of the Dead, 1860-1861), 2) "a being that goes on two legs and is ungrateful" (Notes from Underground, 1864). These two definitions are closely intertwined with what Kant writes about being accustomed, which leads to ingratitude (ungratefulness): "becoming accustomed (consuetudo) in fact makes the endurance of misfortune easy (which is then falsely honored with the name of a virtue, namely patience), for when sensations of exactly the same kind persist for a long time without change and draw one's attention away from the senses, one is barely conscious of them anymore. But this also makes consciousness and memory of the good that one has received more difficult, which then usually leads to ingratitude (a real vice)" (Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, 1798). These and other definitions of man are analyzed in the context of Dostoevsky's philosophical and religious world view, as well as his account for relationship between faith and reason. Confrontation between faith and reason are revealed in many story lines of Dostoevsky's writings, and especially in The Brothers Karamazov (1879-1880), where religion is opposed to science. However, the "religion or science" dilemma can be false, and it should be completed with art, where beauty is one of basic categories. Dostoevsky argues that Christ is an epitome of beauty and good - what is known as kalokagathia in ancient Greek philosophy. Moreover, the following words of Jesus are met in the Bible: "I am the way, and the truth, and the life" (Gospel of John, 14:6). Thus, Dostoevsky's existential analytics represents the unity of beauty, good, and truth.

DE Western Siberia; Turkic-Tatar statehood; towns; Astana; rings; weapons
AB Siberian Turkic-Tatar state formations left a rather bright trace in the history of the region in the second half of the II millennium AD. Particularly should be noted Siberian Khanate, whose borders occupied almost all forest-steppe and southern taiga zones of Western Siberia. Khan Kuchum, who became its leader, had a serious influence on the Central Asian-Siberian political arena. At present, the entire history of these state formations is based mainly on written sources. Unfortunately, the documents do not give a complete description of these states - we do not know their borders and infrastructure, the symbols of the state, there are no markers that would allow scientists to link the famous archaeological complexes with specific khanates. Presented in this article research is devoted to revealing markers of state institutes of khanates in available archaeological materials. The presence of such symbols of the state will allow structuring the archaeological complexes as territorially so as chronologically. In this article two directions of search for these markers are highlighted - archaeological complexes that were founded or created by the central government and carried a specific state burden and personal items that played a status value for their owners.
   In the first case, I single out the border towns built by Khan Kuchum to protect the borders of his khanate on the southern border of the Barabinsk forest-steppe and on the border of the eastern Irtysh valley in Tara Irtysh area. These towns stand out from other fortified complexes by strategical location, fortification having European and Central Asian features, dwellings and supply system (according to osteological materials). Among the state complexes, I include cult places built by Khan Kuchum as part of the spread of the Muslim religion - Astana. These sites began to play not only the role of new religious centers, but also symbolized the central government and became places where many local disputes and problems were solved.
   I consider weapons, armor and rings to personal items. We know a certain significance of armor and weapons for state leaders of that time. We know what importance was attached to Yermak's armor by the Tatar people. The museums keep the helmets of military leaders, for example, the helmet of Eligey. In the materials of Tatar burial grounds of the 16-17 cc. we find burials with rich armor (Okunevo VII) or weapons (Bergamak 2). Special importance had the rings, the signposts of which depicted horsemen with weapons or mythological creatures.
   My research shows the prospects of using archaeological materials for a deeper characterization of the Siberian Turkic-Tatar state formations and provides an opportunity for further search for their symbols.

The authors offer a detailed overview of contemporary trends in international and national state development, striving to advance in the conceptualization of the state as a category of social sciences. Despite the fact that the 15 chapters presented in the work are very different both in design and in the subject matter of their research, the monograph as a whole can provoke a detailed public discussion dedicated to the most topical problems of state building as well as scientific study into how those challenges may present themselves in the modern conjuncture of political and international relations (this is an area which remains without proper study in Russian science). The excessive breadth of the analytical horizon and the complexity of the presentation do not block it from being perceived as a promising springboard for deepening research areas demanded in academia.

DT Article
DE Russian politics; positive program; political parties; power; opposition
AB One of the central issues of the Russian politics is whether its participants have the so-called "positive program", and the representatives of both the ruling regime and opposition regularly talk about the need for such program. The article examines three interrelated issues: 1) what a "positive program" means and how this phenomenon is interpreted in the Russian political space; 2) to what extent it is correct to accuse Russian parties in their lack of a "positive program"; 3) whether the current government, which articulates the demand for a positive program more often than others, has such a program.
   In this article the author shows that, being a specifically Russian phenomenon, a "positive program" today presupposes not only the advancement of concrete proposals and initiatives that look into the future and represent an alternative to the current political course. Its most important feature is the acceptance of the status quo: in order for the initiatives of an individual politician or a party to be recognized as "positive", they should not infringe on the legitimacy of the existing order. It is this criterion alone, according to which the programs of a number of parties can be deemed "non-positive". In terms of their concrete, alternative and future-oriented programs, many parties are not inferior, if not superior, to the United Russia that largely devotes its party program to the chronicle of the achievements made by the country (not the party) as well as to Vladimir Putin who did not offer to the public a single document called "program" in any of his presidential campaigns.

DT Book Review
DE Thomas Piketty; "Capital in the Twenty-First Century"; economic growth;
   capital; concentration of wealth; inequality; political institutions
AB In this article, I review several papers and topics featured in "After Piketty", the voluminous collective work of the American scholars engaging with Thomas Piketty's bestseller "Capital in the 21st Century". The first chapters of the book focus on Piketty's conceptualization of capital and his central argument that the concentration of wealth will continue to rise. Solow and Krugman agree with Piketty's arguments, but Raval questions the estimates of the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. Two sections of the book contain alternative explanations for the rising inequality: human capital, technological development, and demographic changes. Nielsen argues that Piketty's concept of capital neglects human capital, and this strongly affects all of his conclusions and forecasts. Tyson and Spence draw attention to Piketty's concept of rent and investigate the influence of technology on the concentration of wealth. De Nardi, Fella, and Yang consider the institution of bequest and the wealth transmission from one generation to another. Their model shows that a lower population growth rate plays a more significant role in the concentration of wealth. Naidu uses the metaphor of two "Pikettys" (the "domesticated" and the "wild") to describe Piketty's approaches to capital: an institution-and-politics free model of capital, and capital as an institution, "a set of property rights entitling bearers to politically protected rights of control, exclusion, transfer, and derived cash flow".
   Why are existing democratic processes not sufficient to avoid the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few? This question is posed by the legal philosopher Grewal, who claims that the task of his chapter is to consider capitalism as a legal regime. In Grewal's description, all existing economic life is generated as an "emanation of commercial sociability", a product of modern legal state institutions which reproduce property rights as a comprehensive protection of the interests of owners of capital assets. Steinbaum presents a thorough historical analysis of the four leading countries of capitalism of how the dominant inequality legitimizing ideology gave way to socialdemocratic ideology. Derenoncourt looks at institutional differences and inequality from a global perspective. She introduces Acemoglu and Robinson's typology of institutions, which divide institutional systems into inclusive and non-inclusive, and extractive, but she does not conclude that the observed concentration of wealth can be interpreted in such a way that capital in this typology should be classified as a non-inclusive institution. Jacobs argues that Piketty remains within the framework of traditional political economy, in which the political takes a subordinate position relative to the economic, and the role of institutions is not considered systematically. According to Jacobs, the turn to comparative institutionalism and the emergence of a rich literature on "the varieties of capitalism" (and, in particular, on the role of informal institutions) since the early 2000s seem to have been ignored by Piketty. Piketty does not make a systematic analysis of the relationship between civil society and the state, which could provide an answer to the question of how wealth inequality turns into power inequality.

DE mythologization of time; weird time; object-oriented ontology; Graham
   Harman; Bruno Latour
AB The article aims to analyze the concept of time in object-oriented ontology based on the concept of the weird. The authors consider this term significant for understanding the formation of speculative realism as a philosophical trend that justifies the models of flat ontologies. Showing the influence of the concept of the weird in Lovecraft's work on the weird phenomenology of Graham Harman, the authors expand the understanding of the role of this concept in Harman's model of a quadruple object, which describes, among other things, space-time relations. According to the authors, the weird compositional objects of Harman's phenomenology are rooted in a totally weird time, and this weirdness is static. The authors find a dynamic concept of the weirdness of time in Bruno Latour's ideas about the multiplicity of modes of space and time. The authors consider Latour's views retroactively, correlating them with Harman's efforts to include Latour's actor-network ontology in the discursive field of object-oriented ontology. In this capacity, Latour's ontology, operating with flat objects, does not exclude the presence of a human witness, although it does not emphasize it. Latour's temporal analysis emphasizes the importance of labor expended in the production of spaces and times. Actants, humans and non-humans, are busy making time. People suffer more from time, but they are the ones who produce the report on it. The example of twins, which goes back to the SRT paradox, allows Latour to demonstrate a reduction in the evidence of the impact of time on bodies by creating technical complexes that facilitate movement in space. The development of a model for the interaction of paths, networks, and plasma allows Latour to deduce time from the blind spot of the actor-network theory. The authors believe that the unity of different times in Latour's weak concept of time is determined by the position of the human witness, which acts as a link for the dynamic system of networks, paths, and plasma. Moving through the layers of the system, the human witness perceives the contrast of each new mode of time based on previous experience, and it is the comparison that becomes the basis of the mode of the weird. The authors conclude that Harman's weird time is related to the perception of the physical ontology of time. It works when time distortion exposes the weirdness of time, fixing the rifts and contacts between alien worlds. Latour's weird time is related to the social ontology of time. It works when networks invade each other, skipping heterogeneous events. Weird time is a period of increasing density and scale of incredible events. Their interpretation requires going beyond the existing social experience. As a result, historical memory adapts to the conditions of moving through different layers of time modes. Thus, a new field of mythologization of memory develops, modifying modern historical memory.

AB The article continues the discussion of Grigory Yudin's book Public Opinion. The review considers Yudin's arguments on the "plebiscitarian bias" in opinion-poll technology, on the linkages between opinion-polls, Rousseauist tradition and the "plebiscitarian model", and on Gallup's, Schumpeter's, and Weber's contributions to plebiscitarism. In the context of the proposed conceptual model, controversial issues in the interpretation of Weber's and Schumpeter's ideas, as well as an estimation of the Russian political regime in the 2010s are debated. Models of plebescitarism (including their principles and criteria) as proposed by Yudin, and by Urbinati in Democracy Disfigured are compared. The article highlights the differences between Gallup and Schumpeter, as well as between Schumpeter and Weber, in their insights into democracy and public opinion. The reviewer pays attention to the relationship between the classical doctrine of representative democracy by Schumpeter and the bourgeois public sphere by Habermas, and between public debates and the quantification of public opinion. We examine the argument about the continuity between public-opinion polls and the big projects of Modernity, such as representative democracy, public sphere, and biopolitics. Continuity argument is proposed as an alternative to Yudin's hypothesis about the radical reinvention of 'democracy' and 'public opinion' during the inter-war period of the 20th century. Yudin's insights on the social and political onthology of opinion-polls are preliminary, and are reconstructed for further discussion.

DT Article
DE USSR; socialism; capitalism; perestroika; revolution; evolution; social

AB The article analyzes causes, conditions and factors of the 1991 events, which became the starting point for the collapse of the USSR, liquidation of the first socialist state and rejected the possibility to realize socialism and communism ideas. Various attempts are analyzed from different worldview and ideological positions to explain the course that returned Russia to the capitalist path of development. Challenging and rejecting many of these explanations, created under the influence of both purposeful and speculative reasoning and spontaneous conscientious delusions, the article focuses on the absence in most publications and political statements of an analysis of such key factors as ignoring the will of the people and scholarly conclusions and recommendations that focused on rational, balanced and reasonable means and methods of overcoming the crisis -ridden state of society. A significant place is given to the subjective factor - poverty of imagination, limited vision, primitive thought of those ruling the country who failed to offer a scientifically grounded development strategy. As a result, the country evolved in the framework neither of a revolutionary, nor an evolutionary path, but embarked on a turbulent, chaotic and contradictory path of development leading to what the author calls society of trauma. In conclusion, it is stated that the geopolitical catastrophe was largely man-made, caused by subjective factors that played a decisive role in the destruction of the great country. These conclusions are based on the results of 1985-1991 all-Union studies of social consciousness carried out by sociologists of the Academy of Social Sciences under the Central Committee of the CPSU.

AB The article substantiates the need for transformation of information journalism into research and analytical journalism; the concept of "slow" and author journalism is revealed. The author argues that students of journalism departments should acquire a certain set of competencies, which would provide an opportunity to conduct research on socio-political processes and phenomena of modern life. For successful work in political journalism, a media employee should evidently understand the political structure of different countries in different periods, connect current events with the past and the future, and use research tools. Knowledge about politics, history, philosophy, economics, and culture helps to understand how the world functions. Therefore, the education of a journalist is not possible without extensive general humanitarian training. The author believes that replacing general cultural competencies with universal competencies common for all areas of training does not allow developing erudition and general culture which are almost the main constituents of a journalist profession. A survey conducted among senior students within the framework of the study showed the insufficient level of expertise of young journalists in the field of historical knowledge, which forms ideas about the functioning of political, economic, and social systems of society. The author concludes that the education system for journalists should have an academic character and focus on the basic branches of science. (C) 2021 Published by European Publisher.

AB The article examines the dynamics of Germany's relations with the Nordic countries in the militarypolitical sphere in the 2010s, taking into account the historical experience of their contacts. The author tries to explore both regional and bilateral (interstate) levels. The article shows that the foreign policy of Prussia and then Germany before the World War II, based on the active use of military instruments, was one of the reasons for Sweden (1814) and Finland (1955) to choose a neutral status in the military sphere. Chronologically, special attention is paid to the period of the new Cold War between Euro-Atlantic security community and Russia. The article attempts to show that Germany is not interested in the rejection of Sweden and Finland from their conditionally neutral status de jure. Another question is how Germany used the new Cold War to deepen and expand its contacts with all the countries of Northern Europe. The article also discusses the influence of the Donald Trump factor on these relations. Starting in 2018, we may face increased use of the Bundeswehr in military exercises organized in the region. The article attempts to analyze the determination and dynamics of this trend.

LA Russian
DT Article
DE Rorty; Bernstein; Margolis; neo-pragmatism; syncretism; philosophical
   method
AB The article argues that Richard Rorty's pragmatism included a wide range of philosophical views, from criticism of analytic philosophy and relativism to a philosophical ecumenist, and, finally, a syncretist in the prophecy of the coming of the era of "post-philosophy". The most characteristic feature of Rorty's evolution was the denial of the importance of the concept of the philosophical method. Rorty's syncretism consisted in the fact that the rejection of the method came from different, even incompatible sources. The article analyzes two such sources - the concept of scientific rationality by Thomas Kuhn and existential analytics by Martin Heidegger. Rorty borrowed Kuhn's criticism of the concept of scientific method, which consists in weakening its specific rationality, and used it to demonstrate the unfounded claims of analytic philosophers to the scientific method in philosophy. Rorty went further than Kuhn, trying to get rid of the difference in the "ontological status" of physical objects and the conditions of human existence. Rorty also believes that Heidegger abandoned the phenomenological method after Being and Time, discarded the concept of ontology, and tries to recreate Western philosophy in his own way. At the same time, Heidegger does not want "Being" to be the subject of quasi-scientific research, and does not use any method at all. The above-stated motives of Rorty's apparent rejection of the very concept of method in Kuhn and Heidegger contradict the widespread belief that the success of philosophical works is somehow connected with the accepted or invented philosophical method. This belief causes a special protest in Rorty, primarily because it calls into question everything that is being done by other philosophers. Perhaps, it was the lack of a specific philosophical method that attracted Rorty to the unsystematic continental philosophy, which was a reaction to systems. Hermeneutics, which is often considered a method of philosophizing, acquired very vague outlines in Rorty: in the final analysis, the "conversation of humanity" claims to be a metaphor rather than a method.

AB A little-known source - the manuscript "Historical information on the fragility of the political situation of Hulunbuir", stored in the State Archives of the Irkutsk region is considered. Description of the manuscript, clarification of its dating, determination of the probable source base was performed by the author of the article. A comparative analysis of the historical facts presented in the manuscript was carried out. It was found that in the first two sentences the anonymous author outlined the essence of the uncertain situation that developed with the annexation of Hulun Buir to Outer Mongolia in 1912. Other components of the text are characterized: little-known information about the trip to Urga of the Bargut lama Lobsanchjamba and then about the visit of the delegation of Hulun-Buir; data on the meeting of the delegates with the Russian consul V. F. Lyuba and a description of his reaction to the fact of the annexation of Hulun-Buir to Outer Mongolia; finally, it is said about the disappointment of the ruler of Hulun-Buir - Shenfu, who realized the dependence of Hulun-Buir on the dependent, in turn, Outer Mongolia, etc. An analysis of the contents of the last page of the manuscript allows us to conclude that part of the Hulunbuir officials, close to the Manchus, expressed open dissatisfaction with the situation. The author of the article suggests that some of the Daurian officials, unlike the Barguts, who sincerely believed in the creation of a unified Mongolian state, tended to restore the Manchu dynasty and were unhappy with the unclear future of Hulun Buir.

AB The article highlights the details of the foreign policy of the Arab Republic of Egypt and its impact on the regional security of the state of Israel in between 2012-2013. After the Islamists came to power, they began to dominate expectations that the political force led by Mohamed Morsi would initiate an active anti-Israel policy, however, with active anti-Semitic rhetoric, the "Muslim brotherhood" was able to maintain peaceful relations with Israel. The purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship between M. Morsi's government and the state of Israel during the period 2012 to 2013while revealing the impact of various factors on the preservation of peace in the region, especially in the face of the conflict situation that intensified in neigh boring countries such as Libya and Syria. The main approaches to the study of the problem under consideration were analytical method and content analysis. It is concluded that the article can also contribute to the study of the history of the Middle East within the framework of Arab-Israeli relations against the deterioration of the political situation and the strengthening of religious radicalism in the region.

TI POLITICS IN THE NON-POLITICAL: THE IDEOLOGY OF CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN
   PROFESSIONAL CONGRESSES IN THE EARLY 20th CENTURY
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
LA Russian
DT Article
DE political history; social history; history of professions; history of
   ideas
AB This article considers congresses organised by representatives of various professions (technicians, doctors, teachers) on the eve of the First Russian Revolution. Based on documents from the four most important and populous public meetings, the authors conclude that they turned into a meeting place for non-zemstvo intellectuals with public figures from the zemstvo movement, which led to the emergence of a political class. The purpose of this article is to describe the evolution that the congresses underwent based on the analysis of congress documents (meeting records, reports, resolutions, etc.), periodicals, and political investigations covering their work. It is demonstrated that congresses ceased to be reviews of achievements of certain branches of the national economy (science and technology, medicine, and public education), which were meant to confirm the recognition of their significance by the state. Instead, they turned into demonstrations of the independent position of professional figures on issues of professional and socio-political agenda, into channels for mobilising public opinion in the direction of constitutional reform of the autocratic system and ideological preparation for the First Russian Revolution. The congresses promoted the involvement of the community outside the zemstvo in transforming the bureaucratic system into a legal state and class-based Russian society into civil society. On the eve of 1905, public congresses were an important milestone in the development of the liberation movement in Russia and symbolised its transition to so-called "new liberalism". It was characterised by overcoming the monopoly position of zemstvo activists in the liberal movement and involving various professional groups in Russian society, mobilising public opinion to discuss public participation in political decision-making. According to the authors, professional forums were historically significant as they had an impact on the ruling elite: they let it know about public ideas concerning urgent socio-political transformations and ensured public participation in the development of strategies for their implementation. Professional congresses lie at the intersection of several areas of modern historical knowledge: political and social history, the history of ideas, and the history of professions. However, they have not been studied comprehensively so far, and the authors fill this historiographical gap.

DE GR-communication; neopluralistic approach; corporation; competition;

AB The article shows that modern corporate structures utilize all the possibilities of the territory of their presence and can lobby their interests through officials and deputies, use media resources and support protest activity. The neopluralistic approach to the relationship of the substantive need for professional GR and the dynamics of relations with the power environment at the regional level has undergone comprehension and systematization. Corporate policy is interpreted as a space constructed in the course of communication processes with various stakeholders. By analyzing the reproducing interactions between business and government at the regional level, conflictogenic factors and risks of GR-communications were revealed. As sources of information about GR, official documents of state bodies and business structures were examined. Non-financial reports of large companies operating in the Siberian Federal District contain information on corruption and risks of spot checks by officials. In these cases, officials can represent their commercial interests or the interests of competitors and others. Mass media can also prepare publications of a commissioned nature. In the framework of court proceedings, attempts are made to influence the judge outside the procedure, which is prohibited by law, but in 30% of cases such appeals are made by commercial organizations and entrepreneurs. Such protest behavior is associated with economic activity in the territory, factors of legal culture and the availability of other means of resolving disputes. Corporate structures ensure direct representation of their interests in the regional parliament when this is not limited by the actions of competitors and the attentive public. In the Siberian Federal District, GR-communications are effective due to the limitations of the conflict nature of the political environment, the exclusion of the public from the discussion of many issues. As a result, GR-technologies are difficult to distinguish from the professional activities of legislators and experts in the interests of voters. The conclusion of the study is that the effectiveness and conditions of GR-communication are important for a holistic understanding of the mechanisms of representation of interests. It is also necessary to consider in more detail the reasons for the paradoxicality of GR-activity, which are rooted in the contextual characteristics of interaction with the authorities.

   metropolitans; Tatar-Bukhara settlement
AB The process of building ethno-religious boundaries in the 18th century in the social space of Western Siberia is considered on the example of the provincial center Tobolsk. The relevance of the study is due to the transformation of ethno-confessionalism from a cultural phenomenon into an instrument that can be used for political purposes in modern Russia. One of the methodological research tools is the method of analysis of the "new local history", which allows you to create a holistic perception of the study of the social life of the past "at a local object". The main stages of the state ethno-confessional policy in the 18th century are highlighted. The facts of the forced Christianization of Muslims are clarified. The authors draw attention to the role of the personal (subjective) factor in the processes under study. On the example of the activities of Metropolitan Sylvester Glovatsky and the governor F. I. Soimonov, the vector of the development of interfaith relations is considered, which often depends on the foresight and ideological attitudes of local authorities. Particular attention is paid to government decrees reflecting the position of the state in the ethno-religious sphere. The features are revealed and the main stages of the process of Christianization of Siberian Muslims during the 18th century are highlighted. The process of formation of interfaith boundaries in the multiethnic Siberian region is analyzed. The historiography of the topic under study is presented.

The celebration of this anniversary became the most large-scale commemorative event in the social and political life of Imperial Russia in the 19th century dedicated to the Patriotic war of 1812. A historical analysis is performed on the material of mass media and memoirs of contemporaries. The focal point of our article is a set of commemoration practices the state used during the celebration: what ceremony was carried out and what goals are pursued by the state, what are the narratives of historical memory has existed in the press. Analysis of those practices can help understand the process and mechanism of formation of the collective memory.

DE Caucasian War; population transfer; Russian Empire
AB The article examines the history of transfers (displacements) of the population during the years of the Caucasian War. Transfers are analyzed in the context of the Russian Empire's policy of establishing military and political control in the region. The article is based on the materials of several federal and regional archives, as well as published historical evidence and research literature. The author concludes that the history of colonization of the North Caucasus, which is widely represented in historiography, needs revision. The history of Russian colonization is a narrative about the adaptation of the Cossacks and peasants to the new conditions of life and interaction with the local population. However, new settlers came to the territories previously occupied by the indigenous population forced to leave them. In this respect, it is the history of transfers that allows us to understand the motives of the imperial administration, the mechanisms of organization of relocations, and the resettlement reflection of the population. Another conclusion of the article is that during the course of the Caucasian War, population transfers became one of the standard mechanisms of the Russian administration, and the large-scale eviction of the Adygs in 1862-1864 was a continuation of this policy.

AB The article analyzes governmental debates on the functions, rights and privileges of the Armenian Catholicoi in the context of inter-institutional controversies. The author attempts to identify and analyze the most influential programmes for solving the "Echmiadzin issue" and their origins presenting at the same time certain aspects of political interaction between the Russian Empire and the Armenian Church as overlapping processes and related events. The history of relationships between Russian state and Armenian Church in XIX-XX centuries shows that different actors of the imperial politics had different ideas about the optimal model of cooperation with Echmiadzin. The divisions took place not only between the various departments (the Ministry of Internal Affairs versus the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), but also within them, where individual officials could hold "anti-departmental" views in each particular case. All this hindered administrative consolidation, slowed down the empire's response to important political challenges and dragged the imperial structures into protracted service-hierarchical confrontations. The "Etchmiadzin Question" and the governmental discussions around it show in part the administrative paralysis of the autocracy and the decompensation of the system of power in the Russian Empire in the early 20th century.
   The article employs a rich documentary base of archival materials from the collections of the Russian State Historical Archive. These materials are introduced into the scholarly discourse for the first time ever.

DT Article
DE Henry II; Gallican Church; "Gallican crisis"; Raoul Spifame; everyday
   piety; national martyrology of warriors
AB During the so-called 'Gallican crisis' between 1551 and 1552, Pope Julius III accused the French king of preparing an ecclesiastical schism, while the possibility of establishing a French patriarchate was discussed in the royal council. Before long, however, the conflict gave way to a close alliance between the Pope and King Henry II. Was the 'Gallican crisis' just a tool of political pressure on Julius III? To what extent were the plans of the king and his entourage to reform the Gallican Church serious? The lack of sources can be filled, at least in part, by turning to the work by Raoul Spifame, a lawyer of the Paris Parliament, titled Dicaearchiae Henrici Regis Christianissimi Progymnasmata (1556). In its essence, it is a collection of rhetorical exercises in the field of jurisprudence written in the form of royal decrees designed to reform everything in the kingdom. Surprisingly, some of these fictional measures later would be actually implemented. The reason for the author's 'clairvoyance' lies in his contacts with the secretaries of state who were then preparing large-scale reforms, which would eventually be cancelled due to the unexpected death of the king and the outbreak of the Wars of Religion. A considerable part of the decrees is devoted to plans of the reform of the Gallican Church: from the elevation of the Bishopric of Paris to the rank of an archdiocese to tightening control over the morals of prelates. This article pays special attention to how the Dicaearchiae regulated the elements of 'everyday piety' - the rituals of blessing of the bridal chamber, purification after childbirth, and belief in the existence of limb. A limitation of 'luxury' was also to be introduced: refusal of precious ecclesiastical ornaments, redundant bells, and a reduction in the number of holidays associated with the veneration of saints. Without abandoning the cult of saints, Spifame undertakes a reform of the ecclesiastical calendar and creates a sort of national martyrology of warriors who died for their homeland and 'are venerated as saints without a canonisation'.

AB Research of the Turkic (including Asia Minor), social-political, cultural and ethnolinguistic space of Eurasia is a significant and long-standing tradition of practical and academic research centers of Russia and Europe, including Ukraine. The Turkic (including Ottoman) political and cultural legacy played an especially important role in the history and culture of the peoples of Russia, Ukraine and modern Turkic states. Famous states and societies of the Turkic world (Turkish Khaganates, Volga Bulgaria, the Ulus of Jochi, the Ottoman Empire and other states of the Middle Ages and the modern period), the geographical and historical-cultural areas that were traditionally occupied by Turkic peoples of the Russian and Ottoman empires and Eurasia in general became a subject of academic research done by Russian and European orientalists (experts on Turkic and Ottoman history and culture) of the 19th - early 20th centuries.
   A. Y. Krymsky made an enormous contribution into the research of the history and culture of Turkic peoples of Eurasia, and any further studies of his rich academic legacy in Turkology and Ottoman studies during the main periods of his work in Moscow and Kiev remain of great relevance.

AB N.E. Vashkau in the essay "On the way to the dialogue of national historiographies" notes the importance of historical memory, interaction within the framework of the intercultural dialogue of historiographies. A.A. German, in solidarity with some of T. Kraus'views on the historical memory of the Second World War, starts a polemic with him on a number of problems related to the theory, history and practice of the creation, development and fall of Soviet state socialism. T.B. Ivanova (section "Historical memory forecasting the future") focuses on self-government as an instrument of social emancipation as a direction to develop the social structure, which T. Kraus pays special attention to in theory and political activity. The author pays attention to the wide information and evidence base offered by T. Kraus to prove the value of this idea every time for the next social reconstruction. E.F. Krinko in the section "Soviet history in a Marxist reading: Tamas Kraus on revolution, socialism, war and other issues" notes that the publication of the book provides us with a deep understanding about the Hungarian historian views basing on the denial of capitalism with its ideals of individualism and private property and commitment to the socialist idea. He emphasizes that T. Kraus rejects both the application of the theory of totalitarianism to Soviet history due to its limited research potential, and the apologetics of Soviet man and state socialism. S.G. Sidorov focused on the second section of T. Kraus' book "War and Genocide. Historical facts and the politics of memory", in which the author gives answers to important questions: who is responsible for the war; whether it is possible to compare the Nazi Germany with the USSR as well as GULAG and Auschwitz; who is guilty of civilians genocide and others. Sidorov has come to the conclusion that the application of "his methodological conviction - the third way" actually led the author to estimates that are close to many ones given by modern Russian historians, and allowed him to reasonably and fairly criticize the views on World War II, the Soviet period of Russian history prevailing today in Hungary and in the West.

AB "Velvet divorce" between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993 led to the establishment of two independent states. Unlike the Czech Republic, which until the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 had a history of independence and regarded the state that emerged after the WWI as an extension of its statehood, Slovakia viewed itself differently. It believed that there was no historical continuity between Czechoslovakia and the modern Slovak state, that coexistence of Czechs and Slovaks in a single state was forced and Slovaks' rights were oppressed for more than 70 years. The politics of memory helped support such ideas in an atmosphere of growing nationalist sentiments. This led to the restoration of memories not only of historical figures who actively fought for the national rights of Slovaks but also of those who collaborated with criminal political regimes and violated basic human rights and freedoms. It was particularly popular in the early period of independence. Along the integration into Western Europe there was a departure from the nationalist discourse in Slovakia, although its rejection was never complete. It resurfaced during the so-called "memorial boom" (2015 - 2020). To understand the specifics of politics of memory in Slovakia it has to be compared with that of Czech. The key differences are in the new ideology chosen by national elites. For the Czech Republic, anti-communism became a basis, while in Slovakia there was no complete denial of the communist past. In many respects, this affected the perception of the USSR and Russia as its successor.

AB Despite the wealth of studies on neoliberalism, research on why authoritarian states engage in processes of neoliberalization remains scarce. Therefore, our article seeks to explore why autocracies use neoliberal power practices, which, as suggested by Foucauldian governmentality approach to neoliberalism, are understood as governance techniques aimed primarily at disciplining and controlling populations through promoting the free market as a key form of societal organization. Empirically, these power practices can manifest in a state's withdrawal from the provision of welfare services. However, scholars have argued that control over the public sector is essential to the maintenance of authoritarian regimes, and hence, governments must have compelling reasons to opt for its neoliberalization. In this study, we employ three mutually nonexclusive theoretical perspectives that suggest incentives that may motivate autocrats to retreat from the welfare sector; these are the authoritarian legitimation, authoritarian modernization, and political economy perspectives. By means of a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we tested the foregoing theories on a sample of 42 autocracies active during 1980-2005. The results revealed that authoritarian modernization theory has the highest explanatory capacity, as it identifies two distinct pathways to public sector neoliberalization-internal and external policy considerations or one of the two-while the political economy perspective was an important theoretical concern in several cases. Overall, our paper contributes to research on the governmentality approach to neoliberalism and serves as a departure point for further investigations into neoliberal authoritarianism.

AB Introduction. The purpose of this article is to find out to what extent the "social state" concept, brought to the fore of domestic political, social, and economic agendas by amendments to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, is able to satisfy the demand of the mass political consciousness in Russia for the image of the country's future. Methods and materials. To solve this problem, a wide range of general scholarly and specific political science approaches and methods were used. The conclusions are based on the results of opinion polls conducted by the largest social surveys research organizations of Russia (i.e. "Russian Public Opinion Research Center", "Levada-Center", and "Public Opinion Foundation"), analysis of the programs of political parties, speeches of Russian politicians, as well as on the observation over the Russian political process. Analysis. The views of citizens on the prospects for the development of relations between the state and society in Russia are analyzed in relation to the political projects of leading Russian political actors; the prospects of key projects of the existing political, social, and economic system optimization in the context of their compliance with the needs of various social groups in modern Russia are considered; estimation of social risks of their implementation is given. Results. An inference is made that formation of a socially desired image of the future of Russia requires a significant adjustment of the main Russian political actors' activities. Domestic political parties need a renewal of their leadership and relevant institutional and ideological reformatting; the highest bodies of state power need to adjust the political course - first of all, it is necessary to establish control over the use of natural resources, introduce a differentiated taxation system, and stimulate production. The lack of a clear response from government bodies and party structures to society's requests for a just, socially responsible state creates risks for the stability of the domestic social and political system, and can be used by destructive political forces to implement the scenario of a "colour revolution" in Russia.

DE historiography of philosophy; methodology of history of philosophy;
   Kant; Hegel; historicism
AB Philosophy of the 19th century took shape under the influence of Kant and Hegel, who changed the trajectories of the development of philosophy and its history. Until the 19th century, the history of philosophy was a secondary informative discipline; by the 19th century, speculative, critical approaches began to form in it, calling into question the value of the informative one. The 19th century offers two options for writing the history of philosophy: one, as before, tends to inform about the facts and elements of succession in philosophy; the other is focused on finding the causes, grounds, and ultimate goals of the formation of reason and rationality. Neither Kant nor Hegel create special historical and philosophical works; as a rule, these are lecture texts published by their disciples. Moreover, both of them have a clear conception on the history of philosophy. Shaping its new image, both philosophers interpret its relationship with history and philosophy in different ways. Kant introduces the concept of the philosophical history of philosophy. The historical idea of philosophy can only represent what the order and manner of philosophizing were, but cannot show the development of the human mind and rationality. Therefore, the history of philosophy cannot be written on the basis of facts but must be based on rational premises and first principles. The summary of Kant's approach is that the philosophical history of philosophy will not differ from philosophy itself, and the historical history of philosophy is actually impossible. Hegel's assessment of the history of philosophy is not alien to historicity and the establishment of succession, but they are not its ultimate goal: the task of the history of philosophy is to discover some universal scheme, or system, in which the process of changing philosophical doctrines unfolds and defines itself by virtue of the original cause and final goal. Unlike Kant, Hegel sees philosophical processes as historical ones; there is a real rational order behind them. Both philosophers completely abandon the informative function of the history of philosophy. They see its goal in establishing the fundamental principles of reason, but this is actually the mode of philosophy, but not of its history. In such assessments, Hegel is also an obvious supporter of the philosophical history of philosophy, but his sensitivity to the historicity and systemic nature of philosophy contributed to the preservation of informative histories of philosophy. This was facilitated not only by the Hegelian approach, but also by the Bildung idea and the significant successes of classical German philology. Both philosophers idealized an a priori logical approach to the history of philosophy, but realized its impossibility due to the significant role of the empirical basis in the history of philosophy.

AB This review of the monograph "Minin: A Portrait against the Background of the Era" assesses the results of studying the biography and political activities of a prominent representative of a Bolshevik party, who greatly contributed to the establishment and consolidation of the Soviet power in Southern Russia. The authors of the book have discovered and generalized considerable factual material concerning Sergey Konstantinovich Minin's formation as a revolutionary and introduced into scientific use a set of documents indicating his place in organizing the defense of Tsaritsyn against the White armies during the Civil War. The review underscores relevance and informational value of work accomplished by the Volgograd historians. The monograph contains materials highlighting the role of local leaders in the Bolsheviks' confident victory in the elections to the Tsaritsyn City Duma in the summer of 1917; S. K. Minin's relations with V. I. Lenin and J. V. Stalin; correlation of changes in the party hierarchy with struggles for power in Soviet Russia during the Civil War and in the 1920s. The review notes great value of unique photographs and documents, which have been revealed in the fonds of central and local archives and are being published for the first time. The analysis of letters, leaflets, articles, and telegrams provides an opportunity to trace the evolution of S. K. Minin's views on the situation in Russia in the era of Soviet formation; his outstanding talent as publicist and propagandist is evident. The reference and bibliographic apparatus of the publication deserves praise. It identifies published and unpublished sources, as well as achievements and gaps in the historiography on the topic. The review contends the importance of the book for revision of conventional assessments of the Soviet historiography concerning the Bolsheviks' essential role in the overthrow of czarism in Russia, dual power in the center and regions in the spring and summer of 1917, V. I. Lenin's party coming to power following the Great October Socialist Revolution, "triumphal march of the Soviet power," brilliant or (after the exposure of the cult of personality in 1956) destabilizing role of J. V. Stalin in the defense of Tsaritsyn. The author of the review contends great subjectivity of the memoirs about S. K. Minin written by his relatives, which are being introduced into scientific use, and continuing underestimation of his role in the revolutionary struggles and the Civil War in Russia. The prospects for further research lie in scientific search and analysis of documents found in the State Archive of the Russian Federation and the Central State Archive of Historical and Political Documents of St. Petersburg.

AB This article conceptualizes and analyzes the anti-metaphysical trend in the Western philosophical tradition. Emphasis is placed on the period when this criticism manifested itself most vividly (19th century). The basic structure of the metaphysically oriented classical Western European philosophy is reconstructed and the logic of criticism of metaphysical philosophical thinking is conceptualized in the context of cultural, historical, social, and intellectual transformations that mark the end of the modern period. It is proved that metaphysical approaches in the philosophy of the modern period began to lose their relevance due to their limitations associated with methodological settings, which assumed that all philosophical questions are produced and resolved in a clearly fixed framework of metaphysically oriented systems. Change of perception of the world of objects and understanding of the place of the person in the structure of reality led to the formation, based on various previous directions, of a regular anti-metaphysical trend in the new European philosophy in the 19th century. The rejection of the metaphysical consideration of man in an essential way allowed expanding the anthropological horizon with components that were not available to previous models. Philosophical strategies were reoriented from the unchanging and eternal to the concrete historical, from theory to practice. A new critical direction in philosophy claimed to be comprehensive in the perception of reality. At the same time, the principle of criticism was perceived not as correcting and creating, but as an instrument for the destruction of metaphysical tradition. In the 19th century, anti-metaphysical philosophical criticism became a logical continuation and implementation of anti-religious intentions of the Enlightenment; in idealism, such criticism found weaknesses due to the Western European theological background. Bringing the key provisions of the philosophy of the modern period to a logical conclusion by criticizing them, the critics of metaphysics perceived their enterprise as a concrete realization of previous humanistic attitudes.

AB The article explores the development of bilateral relations between the Northern countries and Russia due to the current trend of increasing role of Northern Europe and the Arctic in international relations. The author specifically considers the reasons, motives, objective preconditions required to maintain a minimum level of contacts after 2014. This set of political and economic factors, a kind of Strategic untouchable reserve, not only prevents the crisis, but also serves as an objective basis for maintaining the certain level of working ties, as well as their improvement in the future. The ruling circles support the policy of sanctions, the course of USA/NATO/EU aimed at strategic deterrence of Russia. However, the countries in the subregion are committed to the preservation of dialogue with Moscow and pragmatic cooperation. This positive attitude of the Nordic Five towards Russia is based on long-term goals: the need to keep and to develop trade and economic exchanges, the necessity to develop further economic cooperation in new and perspective spheres, such as the Far North and the Arctic, development of the Northern Sea Route, sea spaces and the shelf of the Arctic Ocean etc.

AB The article addresses the process of European integration of 5 Western Balkan states: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Northern Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. After the demise of the socialism system and the collapse of Yugoslavia, all countries in the region began to more or less associate their future with the participation in the European integration project. The philosophy of "Yugoslavism" was replaced by the idea of European integration. However, achieving this goal was not easy. The region is a complex (from the perspective of ethno-confessional and territorial conflicts) space where the political and economic interests of large non-regional players intersect. These factors predetermined the varying degree of success of the Western Balkan states on their way to the EU. The article analyzes the political and economic factors affecting this process. The subject of the analysis is the evolution of the socio-economic models of the Western Balkan states, their foreign economic ties, participation in the international movement of capital, labor, as well as economic ties with Russia.

DE Lev Shestov; crime and punishment; Last Judgment; jail; Dostoevsky
AB The author analyses the understanding of crime and punishment of Lev Shestov, a Russian religious existential philosopher. The study is based on Shestov's early publications in the Kiev newspaper Life and Art that was run by the earlier generation of Russian socialists known as Narodniks. In his early articles, published in 1895-1900, the future philosopher opens up as a literary critic, spiritually close to the leaders of the 60s, preaching humanism and love to humankind, and as a journalist, who writes on legal and social and economic topics. Shestov opposes violence in all its forms: revolutions, wars, and the principle of criminal repression in the name of respect for human rights and the protection of human dignity. He supports the liberal reforms of Alexander II, the Tsar-Liberator, the launching of jury trials (as a progressive form of legal proceedings), advocates for the institution of suspended sentences. Based on previously unknown Shestov's articles, the author traces how the beliefs of the philosopher evolved, transformed and were "reborn" from Narodnik to religious and existential philosophy. The article reflects the main stages of the philosopher's worldview evolution, encompasses his views from Narodnik to Nietzscheanism and existential type religious philosophy, studies the transformation of his views, as a result of which he "overcomes" the ethics and follows the route of philosophy of tragedy and immoralism. The article analyses the origins of his ideas, examines the influence of thinkers and philosophers who were close to Shestov (among them Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Nietzsche, Shakespeare, Luther, Kierkegaard), observes his method of reading and constructing texts (" peregrination through souls"). In his latest works, Shestov rejects projects of rational reorganization of society... thinks the law and any moral regulations and norms should be overcome. Laws for Shestov do not have love and mercy, they indicate a desire for justice, but human justice is not related to the divine. The only "law" for Shestov is the commandment that "man is the measure of all things".

AB Mutual trust is one of the central principles of the area of freedom, security and justice and the whole EU. Despite the fact that mutual trust is not stipulated in founding treaties, this principle has been widely developed by the European Court of Justice. The purpose of this article is to identify the legal and political components of mutual trust in the EU, as well as the approaches to its implementation. The author comes to the conclusion that the principle of mutual trust originated from the internal market, however its development is mostly associated with the area of freedom, security and justice. Mutual trust in the EU presupposes that a member state does not need additional verification that another member state respects Union law and fundamental rights. Initially, the principle of mutual trust was given the absolute character, but in the post-Lisbon period, "blind trust" was replaced by the "earned trust", which implies the possibility, in exceptional cases, to refuse mutual trust to another member state if the latter violates fundamental rights. Despite the development of the concept of mutual trust by the European Court of Justice and other EU institutions, recently there has been a serious deficit of interstate trust within the Union. In this regard, the principle of mutual trust is becoming declarative.

   "PUBLIC OPINION DOES NOT EXIST"

DT Article
DE P. Bourideu; public opinion; methodology; sociological activity; surveys
AB The article discusses sociological activity in the context of 50th anniversary of P. Bourdieu's insightful report "Public opinion does not exist". The basic points of the P. Bourdieu's argumentation amounting to tendentiousness, artificiality and political partisanship of public opinion are questioned. P. Bourdieu argues that surveys are far too simplistic to tell us anything about public opinion and this can be seen in the averaged estimates made up of numbers and statistics. Although P. Bourdieu does not believe that survey procedures are totally invalid, he asserts that media and policymakers completely misinterpret the process and results of public opinion pools. The key idea of the present paper is that attention to methodological problems of public opinion research may help increase the collective capital of the symbolic power of sociological science in Russia and elsewhere. Main difficulties to conceptualizing public opinion are related to methodological "multifamily" in modern sociological theory and to pluralism of socio-political life. Besides, sociological polemics about public opinion are associated with the opposites between researchers' and pollsters' approaches. Researchers are basically satisfied with a concept of public opinion which might be described not only as an object, but also as a method of sociological analysis of social reality. According to pollsters' position, public opinion is what is measured by quantitative surveys of target social groups. The article argues that some developments in survey practices include new thinking about how to recruit respondents, new methods for field control, and new approaches to reducing of the statistical error. At the same time, in the light of current theoretical disputes and taking into account Russian and global socio-political conditions, a need to ceaselessly defend scholarly status of sociology is emphasized.

DE non-Arctic states; Arctic states; legal regime of the Arctic; the Arctic
   Council; separate arrangements; alarming responses
AB The article, in the context of the contemporary status of the Arctic, examines the legal and political documents adopted by China, Japan and South Korea in regard to their arctic policy, including those agreed upon by these three States. The alarming reaction to such documents in the Arctic coastal states, firstly, in the USA and Canada, is also considered in the article. Relevant western scholars' arguments are scrutinized, such as the increase of "China's military power"; China's "insatiable appetite" for access to natural resources in the Arctic; the argument that "China seeks to dominate" the Arctic and the situation when "the Arctic Council is split"; the notion that China makes other non-Arctic States create separate legal documents concerning the regime of the Arctic Ocean. The article concludes that the western interpretation of such documents is alarming only in relation to China. The research shows that up till now there are no grounds for such estimations of China's negative role. However, statements by Chinese officials as cited in the article and some provisions stipulated in "China's Arctic policy" contradict the common will of the Arctic coastal states in regard to the legal regime of the Arctic Ocean as reflected in the Ilulissat Declaration of 2008. In such a dynamic legal environment, new instruments of collaboration are in demand, which might involve China and other non-Arctic states in maintaining the established legal regime of the Arctic. Thus, the new instruments would deter the creation (with unpredictable consequences) by China, Japan and South Korea of new trilateral acts relating to the status of the Arctic.

DE COVID-19; HIV/AIDS; Spanish flu; social imagination; lockdown; new
   normality; great transformation
AB The author of this article maintains that it is not certain that COVID-19 will reach a magnitude that would justify the social significance that it has in fact been attributed to it by published opinion and government reactions in many countries. It is the lockdown, and not the virus or the infection itself, which is forcing us to imagine that there is a difference between the world before and the world after. This is what changed with the lockdown: "another world," perhaps only temporarily, became not only possible but immediately real. The nature of the world after lockdown is the main question in the conflict between interpretations of COVID-19's social significance. The current government discourse about a "new normal" in our future is part of that struggle.
   After comparing the COVID-19 pandemic with the spread of HIV/AIDS, Wagner concludes that the world is on the verge of a historical moment of the kind that opens up the possibility of large-scale social transformations comparable to the "great transformation" in the first decades of the 20th century. The virus and infection by themselves cannot reach that kind of significance. But perhaps they arrived at a moment when their emergence in combination with the lockdown as the political reaction to them will prompt a re-evaluation of our situation. The experience of lockdown has broadened social imagination and has increased the potential for positive social transformation. But we are clearly still far from any decisive collective action for solving urgent problems through free expression and democratic deliberation.

AB Modem migration discourse contributes to the securitization of migration in France: it is transferred to the security field, endowed with threat connotations, and thus is becoming the direct cause of the security deficit. The agents of securitization (representatives of the country's supreme power or right-wing political movements, or writers and essayists who recognize themselves as independent from any political party's influence and who, however, still share the anti-immigration mood of the right-wing political movement. They use elements of the discourse of fear to achieve their own political goals; they present immigrants as a mortal threat not only to the national identity of the state and the integrity of its society, but also to its public and national security. In the discourse of these agents, there is a clear tendency to create an image of a France "abandoned" by the government and "besieged" by immigrants, a France as a subject to "colonization" by Islam that is incompatible with the secular principle the country that supports republican ideals. Analysis of the migration discourse of securitization agents reveals bold metaphors and emotionally charged expressions that generate a sense of fear in society and give rise to misconceptions about the scale of immigration and the size of the Muslim population in the country.

AB Introduction. The study of language planning and policy (LPP) involves the cross-disciplinary interaction of applied linguistics and political science. The need for this is increasing especially in relation to the regulatory and organizational aspects of language regulation in the conditions of modern Russia. Methods and materials. The authors use the techniques of systems analysis and approaches of political institutionalism: normative, rational choice, theory of organizations, historical, constructivist, network. To study the materials of official documents and legislative acts, the method of textual analysis is used. Academic works of foreign and Russian authors are used through the prism of discourse analysis. Materials related to the activities of agencies and actors in the field of LPP, characterized from a structural and functional point of view. Analysis. The normative and agentive properties of LPP in the modern conditions of Russia and its regions are considered by the authors of the article through analytical procedures proposed by foreign scientists. Many developments from Englishlanguage works in this area can be adapted to the tasks of studying political-linguistic relations, taking Russian specifics into account. The ratio of institutional and conversational types of linguistic interactions is considered as a subject of linguistic pragmatics. The main subject of analysis is formal regulatory complexes and agencies specializing in this area. The analysis undertaken by the authors of the article leads to the conclusion that there is no sustainable institutional LPP model in the Russian situation. This applies, in particular, to the de facto and de jure characteristics of bilingualism as a strategic priority proclaimed at the beginning of the 20th century. In the latest official texts, the emphasis is on strengthening the position of the Russian language. Further, the body of Russian and regional legal acts is marked by features of rhetoric and excessive symbolism. The prospects for institutionalization here are associated with overcoming such normative dysfunctions. Results. The article draws conclusions about the desirability of conceptualizing LPP within the framework of a separate state doctrinal document, as well as a system of information support and implementation of the principles of language cultivation and management.

TI REDISCOVERING INSTRUMENTALISM: THE PHILOSOPHY OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORKS
   OF THE CLASSICS OF AMERICAN PRAGMATISM

DE pragmatism; instrumentalism; philosophy of technology; technical
   knowledge
AB The philosophy of technology traditionally considers the efficiency of technological knowledge as the main criterion of truth, i.e. the ability to reach the best-planned result having spent the minimum of resources. Despite the fact that this criterion is, no doubt, pragmatic, studies on technology proper by representatives of pragmatism are little known not only to Russian philosophers but also to foreign thinkers. Works by classics of American pragmatism in this field were practically unknown even in the United States until the late 20th century [Olsen, Pedersen, Hendricks, 2009]. One of the major ideas of pragmatism is a broad interpretation of technological knowledge, which is not limited to the knowledge of production and use of artifacts but applies to all spheres of human activity where a result is required. Within pragmatism, knowledge itself is seen as a tool: according to William James, theories become instruments, not answers to enigmas, in which we can rest [James, 1975]. John Dewey pushes this idea still further by treating logical objects, numbers, hypotheses and other abstract entities as tools that are designed, developed and utilized in much the same ways as material tools, that is, for the sake of achieving some desired end [Dewey, 1984]. The distinctive feature of Dewey's approach is that he does not associate technological knowledge exclusively with the creation of material objects, but finds its manifestations in science, education, philosophy, art, and even religion. In his interpretation, the difference between material tools and abstract objects is exclusively functional since they serve to reach different goals. However, numbers, just like religious and artistic ideas, ceremonial tools are essentially equivalent to technical objects. His technological knowledge serves as a universal type of knowledge, making it possible to reach the desired results in production and in the application of mechanisms, as well as in training, artistic endeavor, scientific cognition, and other types of spiritual activity. In this sense, Dewey's works of the late 19th century were contrary to the understanding of technology and technological knowledge widespread at that time, as well as to philosophical concepts of the 20th century, associating the technological exclusively with material culture. As L. Hickman notes, Dewey's studies in the philosophy of technology were practically unknown largely due to this even at home until the late 20th century [Hickman, 2009: 175]. For Dewey, the success of technological sciences is associated with the fact that, within technological cognition, the theoretical (basic) and practical (applied) forms of cognitive activity are seen as equivalent tools, allowing the production of new devices and methods of activity. His technology serves as logos techne, making it possible to study the technological in the same way as biology studies life. The pragmatic aspect of technology is associated with the fact that it represents all rational methods that help channel and utilize the energy of nature and humans to meet human needs. In fact, he considers technological activity as the use of some natural objects to transform other objects to meet human needs. Answering human inquiries, technology always remains dependent on human goals. To this end, Dewey's conception is contrary to the ideas of the philosophers of technology of the Frankfurt School who called attention to technology-induced alienation and ideological enforcement [Horkheimer, 1947].
   Giving equal rights to technological and cognitive tools, Dewey defined his position as instrumentalism, providing grounds for criticism. Opponents accused him of placing tools or means of achieving goals above the goals themselves. At present, as the development of information technologies makes the relevance of the instrumental component of cognitive activity being actively studied, resorting to classical pragmatism may help form present-day ideas of knowledge and its production.

TI RETHINKING THE CATEGORY OF CLASS: TEMPURA MUM OF THE PLURAL

SO LOGOS
LA Russian
DT Article
DE class; class struggle; coupe d'essence; social whole;
   (multi)temporality; subject; emancipation
AB This article attempts to rethink the Marxist category of class in response to criticism of the progressivist conception of history. The Marxism of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has typically run into a problem arising from the fact that accepting the proletariat as the subject of history makes any political action aimed at social transformation superfluous. From a political viewpoint, the concept of the subject of history either implies that the working class will spontaneously carry out its historical task without any intervention, or requires the dictate of the party to act as a revolutionary vanguard for the working class. Many theorists (Walter Benjamin, Louis Althusser, Daniel Bensaid, Massimiliano Tomba, et al.) have pointed out that emancipatory politics should abandon the idea that history is linear and that it has a particular subject. Does this then mean that the concept of class itself should be discarded?
   Althusser's concept of the social whole as a weave of multiple temporalities allows us to take a new look at the problem of class in Marxist theory and political practice by understanding class as neither essence nor structure, but rather as a conflictual social relation and a political concept. Based on the works of Edward Thompson, Ellen Meiksins Wood, Etienne Balibar, Daniel Bensaid, Cinzia Aruzza, etc., the author demonstrates that the multi-temporal structure of capital means that class contradiction cannot be confined to the matters of production because class struggle unfolds at all levels of surplus value creation-production, exchange, reproduction and circulation of capital taken as a whole. Moreover, other social movements-feminist, anti-racist, migrant, etc.-lead to a redefinition of key aspects of class subjectivity related to the concepts of productive labor and exploitation. With left-wing politics now in crisis, class struggle also entails a struggle for recognition that the problem of class is a political one.

AB The article describes the formation of a military and political alliance of the United States and the Republic of Korea in 1954. The article aims at defining the motives and priorities of the parties in the American-Korean negotiations held from June to November 1954 and at determining which factors influenced the negotiation outcome. On the whole, the significance of conflict elements in the US-South Korea relations increased in 1953-1954. While the Americans' goal was to stabilize the situation on the peninsula and create a strong security system in northeast Asia, the priority of the Koreans and their leader Syngman Rhee, the President of the South Korea, was to restore the country's unity. These priorities were not in line after the failure of the Korean talks at the 1954 Geneva Conference. Being totally dependent on the Americans in the military and economic spheres, Rhee was forced to comply with the armistice and cooperate in the implementation of the US initiatives regarding reunification of the country, which had very little chance of success. In exchange, he expected the US-Korea Mutual Defense Treaty to come into force and demanded the implementation of economic and military aid programs. Although the USA made concessions regarding all the points, they managed to create sufficient counterbalance to restrain Syngman Rhee: they established control over the South Korean military forces; assigned broad authority to the Coordinator of aid programs; had considerable armed forces on the territory of Korea. The Republic of Korea was included in the US regional security system on the terms of the Americans.

DE Olympiodorus of Alexandria; Alexandria; the Alexandrian Philosophical
   School of Neo-Platonism; Ammonius; son of Hermeas; Christianity;
   Paganism
AB Introduction. The domestic and foreign research literature pays great attention to Alexandrian Neo-Platonists of the 4th-6th centuries such as Hypatia, Ammonius son of Hermias, John Philoponus, but at the same time Olympiodorus, David the Invincible, Elias, Horapollon are given insufficient attention. This is largely due to lack of any reliable information in modern science, which reveals the life and professional path of these eminent intellectuals, as well as the fact that the majority of the few preserved works of these authors have not yet been translated into Russian and English. The author of the article aims to study the "intellectual portrait" of Olympiodorus without reconstruction or refinement of his curriculum vitae based on source analysis. Methods and materials. The Intellectual History and the micro-historical approach were chosen as the main methodological basis of this article. The work is based on the system-wide analysis and historical-biographical approach. The source base of the article consists of the extant Olympiodorus works in the book series "Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca". The historiography of the topic, for the most part, is represented by the works of Western European scientists: L. Westerink, S. Viano, N. Tarrant, etc., in particular. Russian Science almost did not study the personality of Olympiodorus: the only exceptions are small articles or just incorporation of information about him in the biographies of other well-known personalities. Analysis. The author argues for the thesis that Olympiodorus, contrary to the prevailing opinion in Russian science, was a smart executive and a good scientist who managed to preserve the traditions of the Neo-Platonic School of Alexandria by continuing to interpret classical works of Plato and Aristotle. Conclusion. Based on the analysis of Olympiodorus works, the author concludes that Olympiodorus of Alexandria has assumed the post of head of the Alexandrian Philosophical School of Neo-Platonism in the competition with John Philoponus, also he has been able to continue the activities in line with the tradition of Ammonius, son of Hermias while supporting political parity with the Church authorities and has furthermore become one of the first of Alexandrian intellectuals who used a classical scientific approach to interpret works of Plato and Aristotle without striving for their absolutization.

AB The article examines the evolution of the analysis of voters' behavior when searching for an answer to the question: Why does the a voter vote? It is shown how the approach to the voter as a rational egoistic investor gave rise to what is commonly called the "voter's paradox" in political and economic theory. Further search was aimed at explaining this paradox. On the one hand, the concept of an expressive voter appears, who expresses himself through participation in elections, on the other hand, we are talking about an altruistic voter who overcomes egoism. The latest theoretical finding was the explanation of participation in voting by attracting "relational goods" that differ in their qualities from both public and private goods. With this approach, the "voter's paradox" finds the most consistent solution. And it is in this approach the shift from methodological individualism to institutional individualism is most clearly manifested. The authors of the article highlight this shift as a new trend in explaining the reasons for voting. At the same time, it is argued that the considered conceptual diversity is a reflection of the multidimensional features of human nature, and it is this fact that gives rise to the ambiguity and contradiction of experimental results.

AB The Museum of Yekaterinburg History, with the support of the Presidential Grants Fund, launched an educational project "You Can't Keep Silence: Practices in Memory of the Era of Political Repression" in 2019. It aimed at finding ways to form a balanced perception of the topic of political repression among contemporary schoolchildren and first-year students (14-19 years old).
   The idea of the authors of the project was to find ways to translate dry numbers and facts of documents into a "human" dimension, to emotionally involve the participants and encourage them not only to learn more about the topic, but also to feel it, to shift the perception of the topic from detached to "personal" and "not indifferent".
   The organizers asked participants to go through a number of stages to achieve this result. The measurement of the effectiveness of the selected memorization practices and general work on the project was carried out using a specially designed monitoring program. It included filling out "entry" and "exit" questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of the project, as well as questionnaires and short group interviews after participating in an immersive performance and acquaintance with the real archival investigation.
   The results of the project allows us to assert that the work of adolescents in the project contributed to a deeper assimilation of humanistic values. This led to a rethinking of the relationship between the state, power and citizen, the strengthening of the separation of the state and power and the formation of reflective patriotism as the most important conditions for successful work with the traumatic, uncomfortable past of our country.

AB The article analyzes eight frontispiece portraits of Serbian and Montenegrin statesmen from the 12-10 century as well as one collective ethnographic image of an inhabitant of the Bay of Kotor. These consist of prints found in seventeen Serbian and Montenegrin 19th century publications which were found in the Slavic Literature Fund of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Saint Petersburg). The portraits are considered as works of book graphics, as historical and ethnographic sources. They were compared with other pictorial sources - originals of portraits, images of genuine clothing and jewelry, as well as ethnographic materials. There are detailed descriptions of the costumes depicted in the portraits, the names and characteristics of the clothes, hats and decorations. As a result of the comparison, it was found that some engravings are fictitious images, while others, made from pictorial lifetime originals, can serve as important material for the reconstruction of Serbian and Montenegrin appearance and costume, including specific historical figures. An attempt was made to reveal the relationship of the costume of the ruler at the end of the 18th - first half of the 10 century both with the fashion trends of the era, and with his national identity and political views. These aspects manifested themselves with particular vividness in the portraits of Milos Obrenovich, Karageorgy, Vladyka Daniel and Peter Petrovich Njegos. The analysis of portraits in chronological order made it possible to touch upon the theme of Serbian and Montenegrin costume history, which has been insufficiently studied in the Russian press.

AB The aim of the article is to study the evolution of ideas (archetypes) about fundamental and applied science. On the example of a number of historical cases (Britain, Germany, the USA), epistemic and socio-epistemic peculiarities of ideas about pure science are discussed in the light of the development of the concept of fundamental/basic research, taking into account institutional factors (academic and industrial research), as well as political connotations of the concepts of pure and fundamental science. The concepts that play the modern discursive and political role of fundamental and applied research (frontiers and challenges) are considered. Mainly, at the internal level of the study of science, frontier and challenge are not fundamentally new concepts for science. There are many topics in the history of science, for the epistemic characterization of which the concept of challenge can be used (the search for proofs of mathematical theorems, the struggle of medicine with complex diseases). Nevertheless, in a wide socio-epistemic aspect, the vocation of a scientist to engage in science in the modern world inevitably contains a readiness for challenges, which can impose certain features on their field of activity. An important link is the linear model of innovation as the simplest scheme for understanding the interaction of the fundamental and the applied. It should be emphasized that, in this regard, the very concept of a model is important. The problem of developing and building models (reality) should be referred to as topical issues of modern philosophy (T. Williamson). In connection with the problem of the evolution and transformation of the archetypes of the fundamental and the applied, an attempt was made to consider these concepts as having the attribute of specific models. The specificity lies in the fact that the situational visions of socio-technical realities (socio-technical imaginaries, S. Jasanoff) act as objects of modeling. At the same time, the fundamental and the applied become characteristic model-concepts.

AB The poorly studied initial period of the anti-olonial struggle of the Algerian people against the French occupation is considered. Until 1830, the Algerian Regency was a semi-autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire. It is proved that in the first years after the capture of France, spiritual ties with the former metropolis remained strong and determined the strategies of resistance of the former Turkish ruling elite in the country. The author notes that the last bey of Constantine's Beylik, Ahmed, loyal to the ideas of Ottomanism, for seven years effectively resisted the attempts of the French to establish themselves in this Algerian province. The article shows that although the attributes of Constantine's independence in those years indicated its Arab character, Ahmed Bey retained the Turkish concept of the state. It is concluded that the legal power, as before, relied on the sanction of the Turkish Sultan, the spiritual and political leader of the Ottoman Empire. The author concludes that Ahmed Bey was defeated without the support of his suzerain. It is proved that he did not manage to enlist the help of Great Britain, which, although opposed to French expansionism, did not consider Algeria so important to enter into a conflict with France because of it.

AB Introduction. The purpose of the article is to determine the specifics of the Byzantine war strategy in Asia Minor. A qualitative military and political characteristics of the main military expeditions to the eastern borders are crucial for the disclosure of this problem. From this aspect, the study addresses the following issues: defining of the role of the eastern military campaigns in the complex of military-strategic measures on the state scale; characteristics of the features the armed forces used. as well as the tasks solved during military expeditions to Asia Minor, disclosure of the features of military-technical measures to ensure the security of Byzantium eastern borders. Methods. Critical use of elements of civilizational, formational and systemic approaches is the methodological basis of this study. It should be noted that the use of a systematic approach in the analysis of the Byzantine troops combat practice in east direction, allows to determine the strategic objectives of military expeditions in Asia Minor, to reveal the logic of warfare in the eastern theater, to determine the functional purpose of military-technical measures. Analysis and Results. The study reveals the strategic concept of Byzantium armed forces military operations during the reign of the first Palaeologus on the Asia Minor territory. Analysis of combat practice allows us to conclude that the strategic priority of the western and northwestern directions, which required the use of the most combat-ready troops consisting of mercenaries during the reign of Michael VIII, determined the need to use the Byzantine troops at the eastern borders of the empire. The Byzantine army was episodically involved in major defensive expeditions to the borders of the empire. We determined that the purpose of these campaigns is to stop the advance of enemy armies and their subsequent expulsion from the empire. This logic of military operations does not mean the loss of strategic initiative at the eastern direction. The strategy of passive defense which determined the nature of the military confrontation in the Asia Minor region was ensured by the creation of a garrison system, or a line of fortresses, on the eastern borders of the empire. Fortification activities of Michael VIII and Andronikos II in 1280-1282 temporarily stopped the advance of the Turkish troops. However, natural factors and the intensification of the economic crisis at the end of the 13th century made it impossible to preserve the defensive line located along the banks of the rivers that served as the borders of the Byzantine state. In addition, the strengthening of the military-political power of the emirates of Mentese, Aydinoglu and Osman led to the loss of the initiative by the Byzantine troops and, as a result, the reduction of the Asia Minor territories of the empire. In an effort to change the situation, Andronicus II proceeded to implement an active defense strategy.

DT Article
DE A. N. Radishchev; anti-Federalism; Condorcet; Enlightenment;
   constitutionalism; history of political thought
AB This article suggests a new understanding of a shift in Radishchev's perception of American democracy from the early version of Ode to Liberty to the final text of A Journey from St Petersburg to Moscow. The historical and political theories present in Ode to Liberty are interpreted not as an abstract social utopia but as a reaction to the revolution in British colonies and an attempt at establishing a new society based on the ideals of equality and freedom. The adoption of the American constitution was the main reason for Radishchev's disappointment in the USA. The evolution of Radishchev's views is analysed within the context of the American debate between the Federalists and the Antifederalists and the discussions about the New World in France, especially the political philosophy of Nicola Condorcet and the debates on the representation of the slave-owning colony of Santo Domingo in the Assemblee nationale. The article studies the key sources of information that may have influenced Radishchev's opinion and analyses the common features of Radishchev's ideas about the US Constitution and his critical approach to the "abolitionist" wing of the Antifederalists. His disappointment in the American experience had a decisive impact on Radishchev's political philosophy: the adoption of a federalist constitution and the preservation of slavery meant for him the collapse of all hopes for reshaping society on more humane and just grounds. This led to the adoption of apocalyptic tones in the final version of Ode to Liberty, as the author's hopes for a better future now depended not upon any political activity, but upon the intervention of providential forces.

DE history of Czechoslovakia; February crisis of 1948;
   American-Czechoslovak relations; L. A. Steinhardt
AB In February 1948, during the political crisis in Czechoslovakia was established a communist regime. This event completed the formation of the Soviet bloc in Europe. It directly impacted the US containment policy towards the USSR and the escalation of the Cold War. Based on archival documents and newspapers articles, the research studies these events through their perception by American media and diplomats, whose opinions and interpretations had great and decisive importance for the US public opinion and its government official reaction. The author concludes that the Czechoslovak crisis of 1948 aroused considerable interest and severe reaction in the United States. It was considered as a part of growing Soviet-American contradictions and international tension. Despite the fears of a communist coup in Czechoslovakia expressed back in 1947, American experts could not accurately predict the onset time of the crisis and its nature. The rapidity of the crisis, the Communist's reaction, and decisiveness, lack of direct Soviet intervention, as well as the absence of democratic resistance, became a surprise for American journalists and diplomats. They believed that the communist takeover was a manifestation of Soviet expansion and the Kremlin's desire to consolidate its control over all Eastern Europe. Despite the external legitimacy, the transfer of power to the left forces was interpreted as a coup d'etat that finalized the establishment of the totalitarian regime in Czechoslovakia.
   Nevertheless, the US government refused to sever diplomatic relations with Prague and to initiate an international investigation. Washington found no direct evidence of Soviet intervention. It had to accept the changes in Czechoslovakia, focusing its forces on the inadmissibility of this scenario in Western Europe. The crisis directly influenced the adoption of the Marshall Plan and the intensification of the containment policy.
